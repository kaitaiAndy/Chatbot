ah , but my puritanism runs the another way . i 'm far too modest for such a display .
that 's easy to say ; it 's not your father .
i was as good a son to him as you or mike .
this is science-fiction robert ! the manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it .
stacy , somebody 's trying to kill me . now goddamit --

and then we 're gon na do her right here . right ?
i was just telling the woman how i feel , for god 's sake .
you do n't tell her majesty how you feel .
that 's right . he wanted us to have the secret , and not them . which is why they tried to kill him .
they 're bound to try again . no wonder they want me to stand by during the operation .
whyyyy ... he took down the gatling gun and the cannon all by himself .
saved all our lives , doc . none of the liberty boys would have come home if not for web mimms , doc . god 's honest truth .
it 's not time yet . my mission is not over yet . there is still more i must do before i can really -- finally -- go home .
but how do you know that these -- these voices are n't really just -- well , you .
rashid ? rashid ! is that what he told you his name was ?
well , whatever his name is , he 's not here anymore . he left two days ago , and i have n't heard from him since .
we 've been through this wendy james taylor was actually at that clinic up near boston .
well , i saw what i saw , and if you do n't want to believe me --
near as i can figure must be about a hundred-thousand .
one-hundred-thousand ! ? that son-of- a-bitch lied to me .
for ellie 's birthday , yes . i did n't go because her old man thinks i 'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated ... they 'll be back tomorrow night . jud , what 's this about ?

what she does n't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people . she 's young , she 's got to learn to restrain the life force that 's in her . its creative , but in her case it 's too creative .
policemen 's bodies age at diff- erent rates . look at me . gut in its fifties . balls in their six- ties . and feet in their eighties ..
< u > hit those wipers , ross < /u > .
i 'm not having any more children . after amado , i had some complications -- i ca n't get pregnant again , if that 's what the rule is about --

i 'm sorry , it was her all right . her gun , even .
put in one of your fixes . walt knows he 's loused himself with the church , but it 's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom . which he will think if you grease the skids for him .
i do n't think i can give absolution to a man who 's about to commit suicide . it 's a mortal sin .
this is supposed to be salvation ? what kind of idiocy are we dealing with here ?
i 'm calling it my `` contraption '' - we 're going to surround it with a boma- a fence , to you- and we 're going to leave a small opening opposite that door .
i do n't know how to begin this , natalie . perhaps it 's best to just plunge in . i want to join you .
we always knew you 'd come to us , louis .
i do n't want to drive another girl , max . the only reason i 'm --
who the fuck do you think you 're talking to ? this ai n't a fucking democracy . you want out ?
haw-haw ! why do n't you run off and find a cop and i 'll wait right here .
why do n't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs .
i hear they all dress like that at lincoln now .
there used to be three or four of those guys . now we see 'em every time we come to the mall .
people change in relation to each other . love changes on its own .
not if the people change together in relation to that love .
i never touched her . my mother 's gr ...
and a < u > fantasy < /u > object ...
forty-five ? i thought it was only supposed to be thirty ?
thirty is base price . tolls , tax , tip ... it all adds up .
it 's okay . she was supposed to pick me up .
her dad 's out of town . she 's staying with us .
anyhow , he 's always saying to me , dave , never run yourself down , son -- 'cause there 'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you .
in what capacity are you employed by this mr. lindgren ?
i got to ask you and martin to ride to the state capitol with me , ethan .
this an invite to a necktie party , reverend ?
you put up with me , because i can read and write ancient egyptian , decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic , and i 'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library .
who needs smart women ? i put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons , allah rest their souls . now straighten up this mess !
man , this here newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself luke do n't know nuthin ' 'bout nuthin ' .
but damn if he do n't look like a fat old dragline .
i do n't know what you 're talking about . what 's happened ?
there 's been a break in . lock this door and stay here . do n't move a muscle .
is this how a federation officer begs for his life ?
i 'm not begging for my life . i 'm begging for yours . there is still a way home , gal'na .
congratulations , you 've just graduated at the head of your class .
you 're a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
i do n't want to play games with you , isabella . i like you . i can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes .
well , i 'm very tempted . it 's such a beautiful yacht . what 's it called ?
i 'd say you must have the wrong number .
well , i just talked with ben tramer and he got real excited when i told him how attracted you were to him .
then you 're saying there 's no negligence , based on my question ?
i ... given the limits of your question , that 's correct .
yes ! yes ! the holiday inn ! that 's exactly right !
see ? i 'm psychic . not completely , but pretty much . that was pretty good , was n't it ? !
no . my old lady must have made a lot of promises .
close ... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings i pulled .
i thought you did n't know how to drive .
i said i was too young to drive . i did n't say i was stupid .
because they gots a window with a dogs in it . you want me to `` push in . '' or i can lose the shot .
no you ca n't lose the shot . the meaning of the < u > film < /u > < u > is < /u > in that shot .
you found all this , all this out on one date ?
well , i think he was dying to open up . it 's so sad . now ... what should i wear to my audition ?
i was out there with my cumma [ italian- american slang for 'girlfriend ' . ]
your cumma ? what are you doin ' with your cumma ?
the throat , the mouth ... its vulnerable spots .
it 's a rock . it does n't have vulnerable spots !
no . really . i do n't drink coffee anymore . i used to love it but my tastes have changed recently .
okay well . maybe some other time . they continue walking together .
what are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed ?
we 're not crazy . we 're `` special '' . principal collins wants us to have our own classroom !
what the hell is that thing doing out there ? you 're not taking that body anywhere .
we 're taking the body back to portland and there 's not a thing you can do about it .
and when she left , she never came back .
why should she ? i 'm sorry , i have work to do , mr ... if you do n't mind ...
is your room just down the hall ? ... in case i get frightened during the night ?
yes , but ... i thought , perhaps tonight , under the circumstances , i might ... stay here with you .
uh-uh . i ai n't riding in that trunk no minutes . why do n't i just ride with you ?
you ca n't ride with me . the surprise effect is ninety percent of it .
just a girl , i work at magnin 's --
-- and how you happen to be living here .
it 's between nixon and a kennedy again , edgar ... who do you want ?
kennedy -- never . he 'll fry in hell for what he did to me . but nixon does n't know that , which is why i 'm gon na have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him .
but george , i like to push the boundaries ...
and that 's great . but do it in la and new york ! there you experiment ! show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage ! i do n't care !
easy now , miss , i 've got you ? ? ?
you 've got me ? who 's got you ? ? ?
oh , happy days ! i wish i was doing well enough to turn away business ! more power to ya , brother ! the public be damned !
hey , what 's your problem , friend ? this is a business establishment with posted hours --
but a morning newspaper , mr. kane . after all , we 're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
that 's one of the things i think must be changed , mr. carter . the news goes on for twenty-four hours a day .
sure it 's true . i was fighting for my country as well as myself .
miss farmer , you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
hector , jack , we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left , and you 're on the last tank . time to go home .
< u > that < /u > was a bust .
that is not true , mrs. ayala . your route is compromised . perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california .
i do n't think you 're going to do that .
yes , even the shooting of your father was business , not personal ...
no no , no more advice on how to patch it up tom . you just help me win . understood ?
boys , that was some mighty fine pickin ' and singin ' . you just sign these papers and i 'll give you ten dollars apiece .
okay sir , but mert and aloysius 'll have to scratch xes - only four of us can write .
yeah , to see if we 're on our toes .
no , they would n't send us in with bombs on an exercise .
you see , all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that do n't rely on heat seeking ...
um , excuse me , sir , but the situation 's more complicated than that . the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has .
you 'trade school boys ' are all alike , are n't you ? anybody who does n't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is , ipso facto , a coward !
< u > you < /u > said it . but i wo n't argue -
i 'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves , why do we have to spend it here ?
cause it 's my office party . if you had an office , i 'd go to your party .
fine , thank you . did you watch the show ?
sure i did , that 's why i 'm here .
i asked what < u > you < /u > thought .
you scare me , riddick . that 's what you wan na hear , is n't it ? there , i admit it , can i get back to work now ?
yes he did . yes he did . barnes looks at the monitor - taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
you did n't do anything to the monitors , did you mac ?
i believe the boy is ... afraid ... of me .
it 's nothing personal data . you have to remember these people have rejected technology . and you ...
get him away from her . he 's responsible for everything . get him away from her !
jake , you 're very disturbed . you 're crazy . that 's her father .
i guess i 'm a little screwy . maybe i could believe it . should i try ?
do n't go soft on me , baby . i 've got your note in my pocket . you wrote it , all by your own self . and i have to use it . it has to be found in exactly the right place .
young ? she 's fuckin ' nine-years-old , same age as lovejoy 's kid . bernie . one she calls bernard . have you read the script ?
yeah , i read it . i was just thinking you could make her older . we might even be able to get karen flores .
i guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught .
yeah , right . we 're not gon na get caught .
yes ! in the house behind the motel . i pounded and called but she ... just ignored me .
and you want to tell me you saw norman bates ' mother .
i wonder if you do n't resent that in her ?
i 'm sure i do n't , alice . it 's something else -- something moody -- something sickly -- she could almost be irena 's child .
yup , you must be harry ? sorry , i did n't know your father .
never mind son , you just might meet him if you carry on like that .
get out of town , bobby , as quick as you can .
grace , i 've been fucked over too many times , by too many women . you 're becoming the queen of hot and cold .
do n't cane me , sir , i was led astray .
oh shurrup and come on john . they 're waiting for you in the studio .
it 's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man .
can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry , the electric dishwasher , the garbage disposal and a nagging wife .
jimmy ? bushmills . lookit , do me a favor . i 'll buy you a drink tomorrow .
yeah ? and what are you going to do tonight ?
way ahead of you , wyatt . you want us to help you get ike clanton and johnny behan . everybody knows they 're the ones to blame for your brothers .
they 're nothing . they 're nobody . i want the cowboys . all of 'em . i mean to break 'em up , drive 'em out of the territory .
how long 's it gon na take , for you to drink yourself to death ?
i think about four weeks , and i 've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day .
mama , i 'm hangin ' up this phone now .
no , baby , do n't ! can i send you somethin ' ? you runnin ' low on money ? i 'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are .
and how good of < u > you < /u > to remember it . then , this trip , then , is not a return to < u > america < /u > ...
no , this is < u > pleasure < /u > ...
why ? the guys is ready to deal now .
because i do n't know him and i do n't really know you , partner .
i 've been thinking about it for awhile , and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me .
i thought that 's what i did . who was it that you talked to ?
i want to thank you , sir , for giving me the opportunity to work .
you 're welcome , i 'm sure you 're doing a great job .
this is a private club . you 're not welcome .
are you tellin ' me i 'm not good enough to drink here ?
you heard kelly say `` sam . '' that was lombardo on the phone . and you saw the girls ...
ray . the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible . what we have here , is you on the van ryan property , without a proper warrant , shooting a porn flick ...
as far as crew , i was hoping ben could pilot the mission --
well , he 's welcome to ride shotgun , but we already have a pilot on our payroll . you remember my brother johnny ...
well , the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and i thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow . i think we should discuss --
we need more ritalin . ca n't we just grind it into the munchkins ' food ?
when i freaked out at the pub ? that was nothing , just nerves . dont worry about it .
but i do . i will . youre my sister .
nobody told me digging was so much fun ! you pick up the dirt , you move it , you pick it up again , you move it again -- lots of repetitions , you exercise the forceps , and the pincers --
mmm , yes , i see what you mean ...
hi . hi sandy . i 'm sorry to bother you , but i 've got to talk to you .
okay , come on in . looks like you had a bad face lift .
nothing . i guess it 's hard to pass on this road .
the freeway 's faster , but lacks a certain majesty .
i do n't know anything about these papers , sir .
they 're in order -- it 's perfectly clean -- just check with comsec- intel like i said .
i do n't know . i thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes .
i ai n't got no eyes . you want to see ?
i lost another a year ago , thomas . he was only fifteen .
i 've had no sons to lose , nor daughters . i lose the sons of other men .
just luck , this , really . never been to one of these before .
you 're in gun country now , my friend .
did n't i say i was taking the two o ' ...
no . you said the one . that 's why you said we could n't talk till kenilworth .
what , what 's there to < u > think < /u > about ? the scene 's perfect ... i , i get to say ...
yes , but , joe , < u > joe 's < /u > been , well , he 's just been having a few , uh , `` thoughts , '' about ...
running around . not your work . you 'd better start reforming , cyril !
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested , i would .
it 's gon na cost ya money . it always does .
oh , come on , stop stalling . grab yourself a cue .
with all your powers , you are content to be ridiculed , laughed at ...
my powers fade , arthur . i resort to cheap tricks ... yes ! i enjoy every moment of my foolishness , i join in the making of it , so no one can betray me . but you ! you betray yourself .
i 've been here before , when i was a kid . my old man was in the service , we used to live on the army base in hamburg .
you , an army brat ? i do n't see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
you 've been wonderful ! i ca n't tell you how glad i am you 're here , i do n't know many people and -
and i know too many people . obviously , we 're both lonely . would you like to know where i was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my sunday clothes ?
well ... seeing how you just suspended me , what 's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard , you old fart ?
till the last firework fizzles out tonight , detective , you sit a desk . and , after that , i 'll decide if you keep your shield .
about vesuvius . about superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano . ahh , the look on his face when he saw that kryptonite . when will i see another , y'know ? y'know ?
i do n't like to talk about it , lex .
because `` dr. grant '' is n't looking for eric . dr. grant is looking for the coast .
fine ... and when the tricyclatops comes after you , do n't come crying to me .
-- breaker , breaker . this is banana peel .
-- yeah , banana peel , go head on .
i get it . we could give the public the impression that we were doing something ... charitable . brilliant ! !
and last ... you remember bill here , from the bazoom toy company ? he 's got a little something i think you 'll like .
but look at rites look at this ! i 'm a nun ! i 'm invisible ! i 'm a penguin !
as of now , and until you leave , you are sister mary clarence .
well , i 'm off to a pretty good start .
if i ever won a pot that large the boat would sink .
okay , that does it , that does it , the strudel does it , first it 's brakes then ... . i mean i am not gon na let some podiatrist with a jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and ... .
i 'm not a podiatrist , i 'm a cardiologist .
of course not , cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road , cause , if you looked at it , the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually one guy and --
cowan -- will you shut your god damed mouth ?
i 'll have none of that ! montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman . not a butcher .
easy for you to suppose . while it is their women and children , not yours , alone in their farms !
to school . there 's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment .
ca n't we ever have a discussion without that coming up ?
do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea ?
oh yah-sure , i know what some of your big city , no bra wearin ' , hairy- legged women 's libbers say , `` pageants are old-fashioned '' and , uh , and `` demeaning '' to the girls --
i 've been banished . in lieu of being fired .
i took off on tisch . i took off on corporate . they 'll know they 're not going to see everything on sunday night ...
tomorrow someone else will move into her place . that person could be me . ha , there 's only one of us who knows heather 's handwriting and if you think i 'm doing another suicide note .
you do n't get it , do you ? society nods its head at any horror the american teenager can think to bring upon itself . we do n't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting ?
she do n't like me to see him . says i 'm a bad influence .
i think you should visit your son . and try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job . you need to create the impression of a responsible , decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once .
yeah , i remember you a-tellin ' me that .
it ai n't the truth . he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose .
aye , now and again , but what of it ? i have lost my gift .
i am here to help you . tell me in your own words .
m'sieu laval , i have enjoyed the confidence of this family --
for more than forty years . so madame told me .
i just did n't want to take a chance . i did n't want to risk it . it could have been frozen along with everything else .
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , arnie .
certainly it 's important . it 's important enough for mr. demille to call me personally . the idea of having an assistant call me !
i myself was surprised at mr. de mille 's manners .
clyde , you wait here . glenn , got a minute ?
i had a minute before the mapp hearing -- but i could n't get you on the phone , eddie ...
a police captain . i think he 's behind all of this .
i work for patchett . i had a feeling that there was someone else , but i never knew who .
i know . daddy 's gon na get the rainman suite . vegas , baby . we 're going to vegas !
vegas ! you think we 'll get there by midnight ?
i 'm not ... bobby i 'm gon na need some more stuff . i mean it . i 'm out .
yeah , and i 'm gon na need that ten thousand dollars back .
now i 've got another lie to live down . thanks , jack .
i 'm trying to get you some action , but you 've got to help me out just a little bit .
that 's 'cause i < u > was n't < /u > there .
you were n't at harrison 's department store the night before --
i do n't believe you have `` things . ''
on the contrary . we 're married and we have no pre-nup , so a case could be made that everything in here is mine .
diane , you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments , no strings , because after you get over there , things are going to change . people change .
dad , you and i have talked about this . lloyd and i have talked about this . believe me , this is well-covered territory .
my parents left me that house , i was born there .
you 're not going to lose the house . everybody has three mortgages these days .
you lived in the man 's house what -- seventeen , eighteen years ? and you did n't get to know him any better than that ?
i got to go see somebody in san antonio today . your memory gets any better , i 'll be back tonight .
at the first sight of the morning sun 's rays , we must be gone .
i suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon .
where 's charlie ? i was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials . really made me laugh .
he 's not here . we 're getting divorced .
i 'm not scaring you , am i norman ? i hope i 'm not frightening you . the last thing i want to do is frighten you . you feel okay , do n't you ?
it 's not me , beth . i swear . it ca n't be .
do n't worry , madam , she ca n't infect your dear little kiddies . she long ago fully recovered , but the disease did irreparable damage . the girl is permanently barren .
well , that 's pathetic . poor rose , what a life she has had .
pour me a full glass . i 'll pay for it .
this is a tasting , sir . not a bar .
captain renault , are you entirely certain which side you 're on ?
i have no conviction , if that 's what you mean . i blow with the wind , and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy .
black people keep their cool when the shit goes down .
maybe . but not like asians . we never panic .
that 's all right . i 'll attend to this .
wait a minute -- let 's match for it .
tell me ... where is this rue de thčbes ?
rue de thčbes ? in the upper casbah , i think ...
what are you afraid of ? turn it on .
impossible . once the reaction starts , it 'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet . mars will go into global meltdown. -- that 's why the aliens never turned it on .
i promise i just got ta pick up one thing .
all right , just do n't make any noise .
hey , i 'm a child of divorce . give me a break hmmm , i see they 've omitted the pork loin with lime jello .
we should 've gone to dorsia . i could 've gotten us a table .
i do n't question the legality of what you do . it 's your morality that makes me sick . i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you .
it is < u > not < /u > your company . it 's a public company . and i < u > am < /u > going to acquire it . either i buy from the other stock holders , or i buy from you .
what in the hell ... do you call that ?
i call it blood , detective . if you want , you can call it graffiti .
you know , miss fremont -- he might just have something there .
there 's no point in taking unnecessary chances . give me the phone book , lisa .
... and , principal collins , you 'll be pleased to know that this year wednesdays are `` south of the border '' days . we 'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla .
good . good . good . well , that 's good .
everything 's fine , honey . we do n't need to talk . besides i have to work late .
please , nathan . i really need this . you 've been working late a lot .
i do n't know anything about these things , jorge ...
but you have a right to let us know what you think .
the one who made you should have told you this . the one who left the old world for the new ...
he knew nothing . he just did n't care .
do n't ask for it , ninotchka . there is a turkish proverb which says , `` if something smells bad , why put your nose in it ? ''
and there is a russian saying : `` the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses . ''
now that you 're born again , what do you wan na do ? statue of liberty ? entertain some ladies ? miss saigon tix ? seduce some women ? play nintendo ? bone some chicks ?
come on , alex , let 's just get to alex 's . your bar 's the only place that 's going to cheer me . god , i 'd kill for a damn cappuccino . what the hell 's a nintendo ?
well , it 's only the truth . there are horrible things in the world , rose .
buddy , you are in one of your evil moods , i do n't want to talk to you . i 'm going out and sweep the patio .
feel free to form your own opinion . though it appears you already have .
well , i intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend brom van brunt , but it seems i 've made matters worse . i 'll leave you to your business .
i 'm aware of that . we do n't have to turn this into a big deal . okay ? we do n't have to have a fight . it was important to me . but forget it . just something i wanted to do for myself .
who 's fighting ? i mean , i 'm , you know , tell me what it 's for .
i think investment advice from a dead man , it 's a bad idea . how does it feel to be dead ?
it 's a lot more stressful than i thought .
i 'll do anything to please you , mr. taransky .
i 'm sorry , i did n't catch that . what did you say ?
good . 'cause every time you start thinkin ' , we end up makin ' money .
we need to put together a meet for the whole country . we all got the same problems . we could talk . meet the guys we do n't know . lift a few with the guys we do .
how do you know , you do n't even speak latin ?
you listen to the feelings , not the words .
well -- you 've got me ! what can i say ?
plenty ! about 'the crime of the century , ' remember ?
it 's worse than war . it 's worse than anywhere you 've ever been .
i doubt it . [ beat ] i do n't think prison 's so bad you do n't want to remember it ...
first let the poor thing have something to eat .
it would n't really do you any harm to skip a meal .
i thought you liked them . they liked you .
they did n't like me . they never liked me .
out my way in montana we always call a bluff .
well , i helped my hand so i 'll have to see you .
i 'm waitin ' to hear your description of that .
there 's somebody lookin ' for me . not police . just call me if anyone else checks in tonight .
hilarious . no , i just keep all of my old comics down here , and i want to show you one of them .
oh god , you 're one of those guys ...
it 's none of your business . she did n't have small eyes .
did she leave you ? come on . it 's nothing to be ashamed of . who did she leave you for ? your best friend ? her boss ? a woman ? did she leave you for a woman , john ?
... are you going to say anything to him ?
... what 's to say ? i dunno what he wants from me --
well , we had a choice . steak or fish .
yes , yes , i remember . i had lasagna .
what are you talking about ? i wo n't accept this ! get out ! god damit !
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said ? 'beware the moon . '
damn . what exactly do you do at virtucon ?
i 'll tell you all in due time , after we make love . but first , tell me another poem .
and i 'm gon na sneak off , and be by myself for awhile , like until i can think of a new career ... hotel management or something ...
big talk for someone who 's never been shot off her computer .
he 's afraid . ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .
why 'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
for a healthy baby . for lisa to make it through the delivery . for the phillies to get into the playoffs .
there 's a possibility i wo n't be around for the end of this trial .
my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you .
with all due respect , dear , that 's bull . you dance rings around me with your new technology . you 've left me in the dust .
your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state , luthor .
no , no , listen . i escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of superman .
not true . i can use it to pick fleas from my horse .
by the way , i 'm a real manchurian .
wow . that 's more than a dress . that 's an audrey hepburn movie .
yeah -- guess i got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster . you meet chad the nanny ?
when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen .
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial ? you 'd have to give me your word .
what ? we 're the leadership , you and me . there ai n't enough of us to ...
that 's just it huey . the pigs do n't know how many panthers there are . both of us show and they might start putting and together . we 're not even two hundred strong yet ... but we got 'em guessing thousands .
well , whoever she is , she sure likes to read a lot .
virginia , i 'm flattered you think i got that much energy . i just figured if i ca n't find paul sheldon , at least i can find out what he wrote about .
i 'm sorry . . . i 'm . . .
that 's quite a hard head you 've got there , boy .
you flirt with me , then you run cold . you lead me on , then slap me down . i do n't go for being jerked around .
really ? and what game did you want to play ? you carry my box for me , and i fall into bed with you ?
why you never go back to lady jone 's and learn your letters ? you liked going there i remember . seeing the other children . then all a sudden , you stop .
there was a boy there ... said mama was a jailbird ... said he could prove it..
she 's crazy , she wants to go to school over the summer .
it 's not a real school , it 's a writing class , i wan na be a writer .
that is true , but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love .
it is only too possible . love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult , and it is even more difficult to make it last .
look ms. heller , there 's something fishy here , and i do n't think it 's friday 's special .
i would n't know . being that i 'm just the teacher and all .
helena , if i had it i would give it to you , but i do n't have that kind of money .
arnie , help me . does n't anyone owe us money ?
do n't do it , ted . do n't do it .
any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .
i could get used to this , looking down on people .
they do n't even realize they should be frightened .
you could n't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk .
somehow it was different in my imagination when i thought about it . actually , i did n't think about it at all , really .
no . i mean . i do n't know . what else do you know about him ?
not a whole lot . we take some classes together . he 's got a bad rep , but it 's mostly bullshit .
i 'll have someone show you to your room .
oh , that 's good , very professional . in control . but the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away .
they 're not monsters , lex . they 're just animals . and these are herbivores .
that means they only eat vegetables . but for you , i think they 'd make an exception .
what about the other kids ? you get anything on them ?
they do n't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks , which is something i 'm not even going to ask about --
... < u > no < /u > , they do n't ...
... they treat me like a < u > child < /u > . i , i ... to bare my < u > body < /u > .
that song . i ca n't sing it anymore . i 'm gon na get sick .
what 're you talking about ? they love it .
but -- you have to go out there ! i 'll give you more than your one third ! when i get paid ... just take the fall ! you 're too hurt to fight and the man 's a killer !
pressures on , eh proximo ? there 's got to be a load of money in this . why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window ?
leaving without saying goodbye . what are you gon na do ?
go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .
well that 's it boys , i been redeemed ! the preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions . it 's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting 's my reward !
delmar what the hell are you talking about ? - we got bigger fish to fry-
it 's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge . jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch 's mind .
he really believes jason 's still alive , does n't he ?
are we going to skip the country , uncle lex ?
lenny , , you pathetic product of the public school system . your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . destroying superman !
so , how did you get hooked up with these guys ?
just lucky i guess . how 'd you start working for the bastaldi 's ?
he got my gun ! motherfucker was filming the whole time !
i know . relax . take it easy . do n't worry , we 'll get those fuckers .
yes -- that 's what i want -- i 'd like to tear loose -- i 'd like a drink . i 'd like to go down to that dancing place . i 'd like to start something .
i can understand that -- after your -- uh --
you 're sure you know what you 're doing ?
yes ! it 's all written down in the notes . tie off the kites and come down !
his file listed you as a known associate . now spill .
oh , yeah . that was a long time ago . before your day . the last few years he 's been muscle for hire . but i heard he 's disappeared .
meaning we 're never gon na get the chance to tell anyone .
meaning we 're never gon na get to the surface alive ... to tell anyone .
someone probably said the same thing about the romulans a century ago .
with metaphasics , lifespans will be doubled ... an entire new medical science will evolve ... i understand your chief engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life ... would you take his sight away from him ?
see ... now that we know you know , the hard part 's done for us .
it 's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans .
once warner sees me as a serious law student , he 'll want me back . it 's a completely brilliant plan !
but is n't it kind of hard to get into law school ?
been a long time since anyone 's trusted me . that 's somethin ' right there .
we can , ca n't we ? trust you ?
you 're right . i 'm sorry . okay , let 's go get 'em .
here , take a few of these . studio makes 'em in the basement . they keep the fat off .
our little toy . you usually have it up and running by now .
do i really want to know what you 're talking about ?
they are here ! ... your jewels ! ... here in paris !
alexis ! do you know what you are saying ?
i 'm just a glorified extra , fred . i 'm a dead man anyway . if i 'm going to die , i 'd rather go out a hero than a coward .
maybe you 're the plucky comic relief , you ever think of that ?
gosh , they do n't give you much room around here , do they ?
maybe they do n't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching .
it 's not here . maybe the police are still holding it . their forensic people ...
they said it was here . they told me this morning .
i 'm committed to nuke for the season . you had your chance the other night .
what'you see in that guy -- he 's dim , pretty boy . a young , wild ,
it 's what you and rosanna named me . right ?
sit , creasy . everything that happens from now on does so with my permission . really . you wo n't find a better carne asada in all of mexico .
mr. bartholomew -- are you sure you know who i am ?
charles lampert 's widow -- yes ? last time i sent out a tie only the spot came back .
gee , i better not , if it 's okay . i still got ta drive back up to los ang-gleez .
see your son , huh ? well , that 's nice . a side of you i did n't know , lilly .
lily ... ... skip , that 's great ! you and lily .
oh , she does n't know about it yet . right now , of the two of us , i 'm the only one in love . but i 'm very stoked .
oh , uptown . you know . some joint . it ai n't much .
so why did you decide to drive a taxi at night ?
i want you to throw this one at the bat rack .
why ? ! i 'm finally throwin ' the damn thing where i want to .
oh , what did i run into ? a bunch o ' jesus nuts ? religiosos ? prayer wo n't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer wo n't keep one of those monsters from eatin ' your liver for lunch .
that 's why we did n't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed . we ready to fight when we have to . and we got ta fight now .
i was so excited about meeting you . again and again , i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you .
and two months later , we got married . and all because of one sentence : `` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
but back in '34 , japanese-born could not < u > own < /u > land . so ... ?
carl held it < u > for < /u > 'em . called it a lease . they make payments every june and december ...
there 's nothing we can do . she had the key .
she 's on the account . there 's nothing we can do .
ours was one of the first . erasmus hall . i 'm the president .
erasmus hall . that 's in brooklyn , is n't it ?
what do your instincts tell you to do now , kid ?
leave . take this shit back to detroit and get the rest of our money .
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the western hemisphere conference held on march -- no wait ! it was last thursday , five o'clock at the jardin des champs- élysées ! adam -- that was it ! the garden !
it 's thursday today -- and it 's almost five -- come on !
listen . just because i was the only one with the balls to stand up to them ...
... oh yeah , like `` cypress hill '' was gon na do anything ...
that does it , swana . now you must n't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser .
just in case they do n't give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the touraine , and if you feel the need of a change ...
c'mon , you can do better than that . we ai n't no heel grifters .
you want the stuff tomorrow or do n't ya ? it 's gon na take hours just to clean it up . besides , gondorff 's still a hot item . where am i gon na be if he gets hit ?
sheriff said right off , i was under suspicion . i did n't have a lawyer ...
but even < u > after < /u > you had an attorney . you still claimed to know < u > nothing < /u > . claimed < u > not < /u > to have seen carl . am i correct ?
barbara 's a perfectly good name , is n't it ?
look , about the layton woman - maybe she 's just trying to help the buttle family .
the prize ? so much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again . so much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children . the prize hardly seems worth the cost of it .
there will be more to the prize than that . power will come with it -- and it must be used for good .
that 's right . it 's always me , is n't it ?
since you ask , yes . aah , come on , ring , we love you .
la dai ! la dai ! get the fuck outta there !
hey take it easy man . they 're scared .
what the hell are you doing in that trunk ? !
you did n't think i was gon na let you escape alone , did you ?
i do n't know . they did n't answer .
i was told there were only two men there .
that dirty bastard ! i knew it ! he 's got hold of my woman !
that little blonde groupie with the film crew ? you think he sodomized her ?
adult education is such junk ! the professors are so phony . how can you do it ?
a bit rapidly . i do n't care what you say about david , he 's a perfectly fine teacher !
identity of whom ? you got a girl , does n't even have a driver 's lic- ense ? .. she 's untraceable , john .. you need fifty detectives on this .
that 's what i 'm here for . i want you to come and see citrine with me ? he 's not gon na here it from me but i know he 'd listen to you .
no , not mad at all : she 's rotten with religion .
let her do what she wants . she does n't bother us in any way . she minds her business and we ...
it's-it 's got bad plumbing and bugs . jesus , i'll-my accountant will write it off as a tax deduction , i 'll pay for it .
you do n't think i 'm smart enough to be serious about .
oh come < u > on < /u > . lots of people drink perrier . it 's come a long way .
this is ohio . if you do n't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress .
uh , yes i am . and you are ?
anna koros . she sensually extends her hand , warren shakes it -
i think you should go with red . it 's the color of confidence .
well , i do n't want to look like i know what 's coming ...
yesterday you were wondering about the wall . how it was possible .
now 's not really the time to get into this --
sir ... i believe you have only two barrels .
how embarrassing . did i hold up three fingers ?
that part , nick ... was planned out the day i read your letters .
what . we all gon na dress up like cowboys ?
you 've said that enough ! ... maybe lucy 's dead ... maybe they 're both dead ... but if i hear it from you again , i 'll fight ya , mr. edwards !
that 'll be the day ! ... let 's ride .
how do you know if you 've never tried ?
this is a joke , right ? you just want to rattle me . right ?
thank you . but the truth is , i 'm a single woman in a man 's world . that leaves me very few choices , does n't it ?
i suppose so . but life can be hard for a man , too .
i know it sounds funny , but i 'm gon na try .
but why ? we raised you as a jew .
you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want .
no , i do . i want to tell you .
look , you 're only sort of insane , really . people like you can lead semi-normal lives . you could get a job ...
i do n't need a job . i have a quest .
nothing ? then it must be very boring for you here .
that 's right . have you anything to suggest ?
that does n't make sense . it 's like punishing you for being goal oriented .
well , you can live here as long as you want . do you have any plans ?
what ? no . i 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms .
oh , well that 's easy : i 'm hot . you 're ... well , you 're a little limp . sue 's easy to see through . and ben 's always been a hardass . why are n't you writing this down ?
you would never give up life . if the world were reduced to one empty cell , on fragile candle , you stay alive and study it . you see too clearly . you see too much .
that 's what the one who made me said .
8,000. we ca n't raise more ... we can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity .
i must offer to the duke . i will give you his answer tomorrow .
not really , no . something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news , why you 've kept everything a secret ... when did it crash ?
as best we can estimate , it crashed four hundred years ago .
that ... is highly unlikely . you 're talking about an act of god .
if god controls time ... then all time is pre-decided . then every living thing travels along a set path .
no ? what do you look upon her as ?
why , down at the office , we always look at gallagher as - eh - just gallagher , that 's all .
what i mean is ... i would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here , homer .
mrs. worthington , i feel i 'm very lucky to be here .
there 's no point appealing to colonel blake . they 've got him bewitched .
no . the only thing to do is write general hammond . but it 's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion .
have n't found a mine for half a mile , or more .
that do n't mean nothing . iraqis could have just spread them out like that ; make us think we 're in the clear .
hey , you did better than i did , nova .
oh that 's really reassuring . and do n't call me nova anymore . i 'm a fraud .
no . he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer , and then his family moved away . to cleveland , actually .
how unfortunate . so when did you finally get to see a penis ?
no , thank you . my house has been closed .
oh . when you say 'your house has been closed ' , you mean to say that your business was shut down ?
he did n't say much at all . honey --
in the closet . i do n't understand , norman -- why would they call you ?
but why ? eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of europe ...
because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines . there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world ...
well dad , actually i thought i 'd take the morning train on thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying , papers , you know , lab experiments --
lab experiments ? right smart guy -- paul , you know your mother 's gon na be disappointed not to see more of you -- in fact , let me make this more than a simple request guy , i think you should ...
duffy . this look like a fucking post office to you ? this guy came in here with intent . maybe he did n't know exactly what he was gon na do but he had a pretty good idea . the bartender was n't a fucking accident .
well , we did n't get any help on that . a lot of people saw it . nobody 's talking .
sir , are you referring to the fact that i was suffering from amnesia , and i 've since recovered my memory ?
i 'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past , or if they 've been conveniently `` blotted out '' as a result of your `` accident . ''
federal bureau of investigation , tenth and pennsylvania , washington , d.c .
now i 'll bet it has his home address there , too
is that thing lost again ? ... listen ... if you are interested in a view ...
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint .
look , i just want to pick up my car .
she 's all yours . put a new hose in it , and she runs like a dream now .
she 's a fine ... uh ... pig is what she is ...
i 'm on page three-hundred now , paul , and it 's better than perfect -- it 's divine . what 's the ceiling that dago painted ?
this is general nikolas pherides , commander of the third army . i 'm oliver davis . to be perfectly frank with you , we did n't expect to find anyone living here .
it is my home . my name is hugo albrecht .
i rang the bell but i do n't think it 's working .
yes it is -- i heard it this morning .
yeah . i 'd invite you inside , except it 's contagious . do n't want to start an epidemic .
no , of course not . it 's only that he called last night and asked if i could come by .
that british dickhole is what 's taking wendy away from me !
i thought she was n't your girlfriend , dude .
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .
like one of those `` national geographic '' specials with the topless chicks ?
oh , you know what . i 'm suffocating !
oh ! are we going to have this conversation again ?
barry , i 'm fucking broke ! i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we did n't like , but it 's got ta stop .
bullshit . the guy was going to buy one record -- which we did n't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway . why not have a little fun ? big fucking deal .
all right , amazing . are you quite finished ?
just about . you see , i also have this amazing strength ...
young ? she arrived here in she was at the time . she was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains . the whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people .
amazing ! she still does n't look over when is she likely to grow old in appearance ?
what one has to do , mr. moss . is to fight a holding action .
... holding action . they 're going to tear this guy to < u > shreds < /u > .
you know , did he seem depressed ? do you think he 'll eat the food ?
i 'm an orderly , not a bleeding psychiatrist ! i push things about , but i 've little say what happens to them .
thank you , i can see that . try something else .
we do n't have anything else to try , sir .
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies .
knock it off , pollyanna , just 'cause you 're in love does n't mean everyone else has to be .
now i have jurisdiction ! i said get your weapons .
these are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause .
okay , let 's hear it . i 'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house .
we 're trying to repair doctor cochrane 's ship . it 's been damaged and --
you look like you just crawled out of bed .
no one 's gon na be looking at my hair . come on , we 're on .
'horse and hound . ' the name 's william whacker . i think she might be expecting me .
okay -- take a seat . i 'll check .
the same thing i wanted ten years ago - all the romonovs dead i got the others , now i have to finish up with that nuisance , anastasia ...
you 're insane ! you did n't kill the romonovs - it was the ...
guess you 'd know about that . you 're an entomologist , right ? how 's business ?
not bad . i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me .
but how do you know if the people are guilty ?
i do a very thorough background check . i go through police files , personel files , anything .
it 's not `` invisibility '' per se . you 're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field . that 's what you projected on the bridge .
what about you ? you have n't eaten in days . how come you 're never on this side of the microscope ?
what time did you get to bed last night ?
i do n't know . two or three . it was pretty late .
if it was a joke , sir , you 'd be laughing .
you walked out on this academy six years ago . one week to graduation . you think we forgot that ? you think i did ?
you , jabez stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers , hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you . or -- am i wrong about those contracts , mr. stone ?
contracts ? -- yes , they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that 's all right . without me and my money , they would n't have anything .
why do you ask so many questions ? what difference does it make how carlos and i feel ? feeling does not buy clothes and houses !
drink your beer and do n't get so excited .
nice work . great , chewie ! great ! always thinking with your stomach .
will you take it easy ? let 's just figure out a way to get out of this thing . han , can you reach my lightsaber ?
that 's been noted . but where does it lead us ? unless you have something more to add .
she 's missing . i went to her house and she had n't returned there .
oh god , bruce . you 're still jealous .
spare me the diagnosis , okay ? you 're being ridiculous . i ca n't be jealous of batman . can i ?
this is dr. drossos , chief medical officer of my division .
i do n't care who he is . he does n't know . he ca n't tell 
a masculine paradise -- drink , the ladies , dancing ...
i had a very good opportunity , a young lady asked me to dance -- i ought to be able to dance , it seems to be very important .
something i 've been wondering , what ever happened to your uncle cully ?
why ? you think he might tell you where i am ?
think of it , ben ! with that cursed , bloodied gold !
how come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets , preacher ?
i can keep going , i assure you . shall we try ?
would you stay with me while i sleep a little ?
dewey , personal lives and pasts aside , this is about sidney . we need to know where she is .
what so you can just exploit her again with another book ? sid does n't need you gale .
the central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations . whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism . parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random .
you 're saying there 's an electrical storm in my head ?
she told us you went after junior to save your old man 's hide . you got some balls goin ' after that psycho .
only problem is , you did n't put his lights out , you just got him mad . then he took it out on poor faz , god rest his soul . theo patches out .
and i 'm your friend  but that does n't explain why you are always trying to come between thea and me ?
if i told you  you would n't believe me -- but this much i can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you . take a friend 's advice -- an old man ' s advice -- leave her alone -
well , i better get going . hit those stairs again . was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him ?
looping right ! i never swung wild . i was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under  whop-whop !
it 's that disrespect for you , that 's what i ca n't forgive them .
oh , i 'm used to it . what makes me sore is how they behave towards you . they ought to be grateful to have you . i certainly am .
a double guard 's been thrown around the jail , municipal buildings , railroad terminals , and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution .
ready ? the sheriff 's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the red army -- which is leaving moscow in a couple of minutes . up a dime .
ed , everything goes off . `` cheers '' went off . `` mash '' went off --
yeah , but when they went off people were n't making fun of them . they were n't bozos ! i 'm pumpkin ass again !
external srbs , orbital system engines . its just like the shuttles you flew in --
no . i can not take orders from that underwear model . that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator .
that 's a crackpot theory . everybody says so .
but he believes in it . that 's all that matters . he toyed with you , you toy with him . convince him you 've got a lead on suspect zero . use zero , you 'll find low .
when donna told us about you , and what you told her about the chromium , we figured that might have something to do with this , too .
it sure could , yeah . thanks a lot .
uh-huh . to carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech .
i do n't care what they 're forming . i 'm on my way and i do n't like the idea of being stopped either .
man , you 're crazy . what kind of a place is this ?
oh , < u > i 'm < /u > crazy , am i ? let me tell you something . those women have -- the gleam --
hey , ma . did you bring any clothes ? i 'm freezing my ass off .
oui . nathan 's silk suit , just like you asked .
it 's that darn ghost again ! i do n't know what to do anymore . he just wo n't leave us alone . i guess we 'll just have to move .
do n't worry . we 're not moving . he is .
just of getting hurt . they ca n't touch me inside .
like hell they ca n't . they can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on .
what makes you think he hates you , judy ?
i do n't think . i know . he looks at me like i 'm the ugliest thing in the world . he does n't like my friends -- he --
well , i must say you 're handling it very well .
you know why i 'm handling it very well ? because you 're going to get these guys for me .
brodski i 'll talk slow so you can understand me . she 's thawing . if we do n't get her to the lab , she 'll die , and that will be on your bald fucking head !
what if they 're carrying ? did you even check ?
no . i was with a man . we went upstairs .
upstairs ? chauncey , you 're always involved in some sort of discussion ...
yes ! it 's all written down in the notes . tie off the kites and come down !
yes , master . just do n't turn on any radios .
maybe that 's the only way to get through . besides , six heads 'll be better than one .
not my head , buddy . not me . i 'm gettin ' a headache just listenin ' to you .
took some talking to convince your super i was a relative .
i told her all my relatives are good- looking .
i would say you look rather lost . but then i can not imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home ...
lost ? no , we 're not lost . we 're on our way to delhi . this is miss scott -- and mr. round . my name 's indiana jones .
where 'd he go ? i 'd have thought he 'd be at your side , like an obedient lapdog .
he went to rent a movie , but he has n't gotten back yet . ah , screw it ; i 'll just lock the store up and leave him a note .
you said we were criminals , what did you mean ?
you 're both embezzling . i saw the records .
wait a minute ... i 'm talkin ' to you . i 'm askin ' you a question ...
the audience is interested in you , sonny ... not me .
i do n't need to be a hero , laplante , but i ca n't face people ... the looks in their eyes ... after the trust they gave me !
great ! you make this big goddamn mess , then ya jump . beautiful ! listen , john , i was there at the hospital today , i seen you with those little bastards .
no , you 're not . give me that dollar seventy .
i 'll give you half of it . here 's seventy cents .
no . i 'm learning the banjo . do you ?
oh , i studied the guitar . i had to give it up . gave me calluses on my fingers . as an actress i ca n't afford to have a tarnished instrument .
you think i 'm rich and you hate me .
now , how the hell would you know what i think ? hm ? you do n't know me .
i 'm your worst fuckin ' nightmare . now , if you do n't want me to keep on hurting you , it 's important that i believe you and right now i do n't . so tell me , where did they go ?
i swear man , i do n't know . they packed up and left a half hour ago . all i got is one of their phone numbers in paris .
no . that 's not possible ! if we had landed , we all would have been awakened .
of course . we never left the air . i know - i did n't sleep the whole night long .
do n't worry about it . how are you doing ?
the sheriffs will take over when they get here .
hey , do n't do that . i said i was n't a pro , remember ?
hey , no , i 'm tryin ' to be nice . buy yourself something pretty . i 'd do it , but i got to go . i got this cop waitin ' for me ...
... yes , and thanks to him , smallpox has been virtually eliminated . i 've heard this speech before .

do you know of spirit assassins ? you do know the dead can rise ? properly motivated , of course .
like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip .
is it gerry ? 'cause i do n't think it 's fine with you . give him time to figure out what he wants .
that 's a wonderful theory , sean . it worked wonders for you .
that was ... wonderful ! i 've never felt anything like that in my life .
yeah , same here . do n't forget your suitcase .
wow , we built a whole float in one afternoon . and now the reward .
what do you mean ? we ca n't go in there or we 'll be `` it '' .
just that they came out of somebody 's experience is all .
no , faith . they came out of somebody 's imagination .
`` no '' you 're not sure or `` no '' i 'm not fat ?
uh , `` no '' ... you 're not fat .
they 're calling you `` bapu . '' i thought it meant father .

there 's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room .
oh , yes , he 's in good hands now .
fine . mrs. buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea .
you 'd persist at the cost of your own life ? the lives of your crew ?
lives are ephemeral . the knowledge we gain , the achievements we leave behind ... those live on .
you ... are a wuss . part wimp . part pussy .
what do you mean -- wuss ? this girl is my exact type . it 's her . definitely her .
i 'm afraid i wo n't have time -- i got ta --
whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades , a mortar and two m-16 's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order .

stewart , would you mind telling me why you 're not going ?
yes , i 'll tell you - for the same reason i 've never wanted to go out with those social parasites , those sweet-smelling fashion plates . i do n't like them . they bore me . they give me the jitters .
what is this interest you 've got in her ?
my interest is in you , not in her . she seduces people , she manipulates --
`` cora '' is my part . you 've got to tell lloyd it 's for me .
i do n't think anything in the world could make me say that .
-- i told you to stay next to me !
-- i was doin ' it ! i was up there fucking doin ' it . you do n't know , man , you do n't know what i did !
i need a favor ... i need you to trace a number for me .

these guys are smart . i knew they would n't hit a deal unless they knew all the players . i needed a big buyer .
nellie baby , i 'll make it up to you .

yeah . the shit gets wacked . fifteen minutes .
yeah . fifteen minutes to a half an hour . hard and deep .
come in , prussic acid . what 's on your mind ?
i want to see the original pictures of joan gale .
they will understand , sir . to be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions . history will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries .
that depends who writes the history books . i 'm not a quitter ... but i 'm not stupid either ... a trial would kill me -- that 's what they want . but they wo n't get it .
i 'm saying he asked me out for coffee , like a real date , when was the last time you did that ?
wha ... what do you mean ? we have a date every night .

i 'm going to see a man called julian cross . ever heard of him ?
china will think it happened before midnight . britain will swear it happened after midnight ...
they 'll each be positive the other guy did it . i fear an ugly international incident .
ironically , this is not far from the truth . but i 'm getting ahead of myself . can you tell me , neo , why are you here ?
you 're morpheus , you 're a legend . most hackers would die to meet you .
i do n't like you working with wendy . why are you working with wendy ?
they requested her . it was her gig . max put me on as a favor .

buy and - sell ? no , no , pardon me , exchange .
i see . gold for ideas . you know mr. chang , there 's something so simple and naive about all of this that i suspect there has been a shrewd , guiding intelligence somewhere . whose idea was it ? how did it all start ?
but , ninotchka , i held you in my arms . you kissed me !
i kissed the polish lancer too ... before he died .
this is bullshit - we donít even know what max looks like .

my point , dude , is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million . am i wrong ?
yes you 're wrong . this is n't a fucking game , walter --
that 's a good question , major . maybe if you think hard , you can think of the answer yourself .
well , i was thinking , maybe an enemy attack is not in progress ?
i take it things did n't much work out the way you planned .
i 'm still here , are n't i ? see this ?
look , i 'll be done in a minute . just wait outside .
i 'm afraid i do n't understand . i simply wish to know --
my parents are open minded about that sort of thing .
my stepmom could n't care less , but daddy would have a shit fit . he might even pay some attention to me .

i want a guard on you . i 'm worried about leaving you alone .
now son , you tell 'em when it came from .
be honest , i ca n't say i did it all myself . my grandma helped me get the words right .
but you ca n't call me while you think ?
i was n't thinking . look , i 'm sorry i did n't think to call you while i thought ... i think .
that 's a lie ! they want me , they want me ! i get letters every day !
you tell her , max . come on , do her that favor . tell her there is n't going to be any picture -- there are n't any fan letters , except the ones you write yourself .
no , she flew up to boston for another charity event . she 'll be sorry to have missed you .
i 'm sorry , too . well , nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and , ben , i want to thank you for your time and thoughts .
i just want to spend time with them when i 'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or ...
that 's motherhood . that 's the job , with or without a career . i 'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness . they < u > need < /u > you to be happy .
susan , you 're a hell of a woman . you 've got a great career , you 're beautiful --
and i 'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me .
what , with me on the pillion ? would you kill poor me ?
well , then , i 'll tell you what i 'd do . i 'd jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .
the dark ones will appose you with all their power .
they will fail for , during the day , the power of the circle is greater than theirs . only at night can they pierce the circle .
do n't touch me . or so help me --
what ? what will you do ? what can you do ? there 's nothing to be frightened of .
i 'm not gon na break it , i just wan na see it change colors .
i want it back now . i never should have taken it off , i want it back .
how ya feelin ' , artie ? i heard you was n't doin ' too well recent .
i 'm fine , thank you . i had a cardiac infarction but i 'm on a new diet and exercising regularly . i 've never felt better .
you 're supposed to be my doctor , right ?
that 's right . i < u > am < /u > your doctor .
why did n't you ask him ? sol knows you !
but i do n't know , sol . i never heard of sol . i 'd just get in trouble . that 's why we should n't go see about diane selwyn ... it 's better not to get in trouble .
you never fall short for the work people . i guess maybe you just love them more .
oh , god , sweetheart , no . there 's nothing on earth i love more than you . nothing . i promise .
i 'm writing a book on kite construction . what did you want to talk about ?
i want to ask you a question . do you think ... time travel is possible ?
uh , why , why are you doing this ?
to do right . is n't that why you 're doing it ?
absolutely . just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator .
whoa , i made a mistake . i 'm sorry . do n't go all protective on me . it wo n't happen again .
oh , claudia , you 've outdone yourself . where did you find them ?
drunk on brandy wine . a thimblefull . i thought of you when i saw them .
a p-penny saved is worth two in the bush .
do n't c-cross the road if ya ca n't get out of the kitchen .
look -- if you 're going to get in the way , you can just go home .
i 'm not in the way . andy , am i in the way ?
i ca n't do that for you , red ... we need every swinging dick in the field . sorry bout that ...
hey bob , come on ! talk to me hunh , it 's your friend red , i 'm only asking you for three days chief ...
this is so typical . i ca n't believe you . i 've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?
i do n't know . i thought this is what you wanted . you want stability , here it is .
i talked to ben hubbard this morning . he 'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares .
he 's a good man , ben is . your father always said so .
you just came down here for the weather , right , mr. nixon ?
i came down here to close a deal for studebaker .
lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand .
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge .
this is agent flemming , a.t.f.. we wo n't hurt you . we just want the unit . tell us where the unit is .
do you have t.p. ? t.p . for my bunghole ?
you ever put your hands on me again and you 'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades , mister .
you did n't tell me about red deer table --
we began to worry . some of us have traveled so far , and you are the last to arrive .
i 'm sorry . my grandson fell and broke his leg .
i would n't worry too much about it , stew . she 'll see it your way .
huh ? oh , i 'm not worrying about her - i 'm worrying about that second act curtain , that 's all .
well , after a thing like that you would n't be expected to .
but i think it 's time we stopped talking about me . a woman like you -- why have n't you ever married ?
and i ca n't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger , some phantom you 've never even met destroy it .
you 're the reason i never met him . you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it .
so why do n't you come right out and tell me what you 're talking about ?
listen to miss smarty mouth . out there in the free world .
yes , you did , daniel ! i saw it from the window . and then to lie about it ! give me that beanshooter , daniel !
it 's mine , ma ! pa made it for me -- and i 'm not going to give it to anyone !
do n't he have a home to go to ?
well , that 's why edgar never got down off that tower .
what ... ? do i have so many already ?
to rise so high , in so short a time , is a dangerous occupation . a little hypocrisy goes a long way .
i was n't a manager here then mrs steckler - do n't you remember ?
i 'm terribly sorry - i have a bad memory ...
god , it 's so weird that we 're finally out of high school ... we 've been waiting for this our whole life ! now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want . it 's such a weird feeling .
i know , it has n't really hit me yet .
that 's it . it 's over . get out .
so i guess a blowjob 's out of the question ?
i hope you do n't mind me asking you a few questions , mr. cluett .
of course , yes . just what would you like to know , inspector ?
in a little while . that 's what you want , is n't it ?
it 's what eddie wants . he , uh , told me to give you some money .
but it did n't . and now i need info to make things right again and you 're the only one who can give it to me .
there is no `` right '' . when you change who people are , you destroy who they were .
all right , no more picking on dim , brother . that 's part of the new way .
new way ? what 's this about a new way ? there 's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back , and no error . let me hear more .
very talented son of a bitch . too bad we ca n't kill him .
i suppose i could come to him in a dream . i do n't know . that 's the best i can think of right now .
yeah , great . the problem is , i have four days to come up with something , and i do n't have a single idea . you know anything about christmas stories ?
christmas stories ? sure , i know a ton of 'em .
you really do ? ~ god -- how come you know them ?
oh , you meet them at parties and stuff .
my office is a dump , i answer my own phone ... and youve seen my pay check .
your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks .
hold on , son ... who 's this colonel greenhill you 're talking about ?
why colonel greenhill is colonel greenhill , sir ... commanding officer , fifth u.s. cavalry ... i 'm lieutenant greenhill , sir .
quite a good one . a monet . not major , but it is giverney .
i 'm not here to run errands . i 'm here for the mask .
les , i got mr. lonnegan with me . he wants to see you a second .
what the hell 's the matter with you . we coulda met at a club or somethin ' .
the sar helo is airborne with you in sight .
i 'm marking the radial for five and ejecting .
shhhh ... it 's all right ... also , i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed .
you fucker , do n't you ever touch lula - you fucker , i 'll kill you .
you guys always think i should know everything , and you never tell me anything . am i right ?
alright , what are the three most commonly used passwords ?
it 's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there .
well , hell , maybe that 's why you all have been so sick --
a nozh scrap any time you say . dim weakens .
doobidoob ... a bit tired maybe , everybody is . a long night for growing malchicks ... best not to say more . bedways is rigthways now , so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka . right , right .
that 's not you having a whiskey sour with carmine morada .
this is fucked . you do n't know < u > who 's < /u > in that --
laura , you did n't come and see me today .
i could n't it was johnny horne 's birthday . i promised i 'd be with him . i told you not to call me here .
why ? why do we have to do it ?
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman , did n't you ?
they 'll be sending you up there soon enough . and not just for a visit , neither .
i slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch . help wash down all them pills they 'll be giving you .
what in god 's name are you talking about , woman ? when are you gon na stop listening to those damned talk shows ?
i 'm getting the children out of here . at least until we know what we 're dealing with . john , i want you to come with us .
nah , that 's okay . my brother has to look up old people 's asses all day long . let 's give him a break .
right . give me the will to live . let me go first .
then do n't you realize the bomb gives us peace not war ? and , if that 's the case , i ask you again : why do they want disarmament ?
well , sir , like i said , for the same reasons we do . i mean , all the experts say the most likely way for war to start nowadays is by an accident , or a mistake , or by some mentally unbalanced person --
well , come on , you two . time to go to bed .
mom -- this is the best show all year .
. i wish you would n't do this . it does n't make any sense . let 's go somewhere and have some coffee .
i 'm going in , sandy . i 'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went .
vincent . do n't make me do this . do n't make me get people killed .
we 've both run out of options . if it helps , take comfort in knowing you never had a choice .
what does that mean , exactly ? take their chances .
it means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks . what did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the institute about extinction ?
this is swell . where 's michael ? i 've got things to get straight with him and i ca n't wait on line .
you go see your children first , and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else .
do you deny that you called me ? i 've known people in other states who went back on their word . but i did n't expect it in new hampshire .
you ca n't say that to me ! i 'm new hampshire . if i say i called you , i did . i guess i did .
yeah and i got the bruises to prove it . so what ?
nothing , it 's just that 's when things usually start to go wrong .
i was ... i 'm wade whitehouse . i was wondering , is your husband here ?
he 's asleep . we were up very late .
these people are professionals . they do n't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt .
samuel , it is not something we should skimp on . a bodyguard 's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent . now he 's gone , i feel totally exposed .
thanks , lily , i do n't need anything .
yes , you do , you damn well do .
no , excuse me ... it 's the yogurt that made me laugh .
you 've just to love me and i 'll be the happiest woman around .
lon ? he got married . he has a kid . i kind of lost touch with him after nancy got sick .
do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife ?
certainly , sir . how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker ?
your reputation is secure , scotty . mr. sulu , take the con . i 'll be in my quarters .
do n't worry . you wo n't see him again . what happened ? did you change your mind about going ?
no . i just came back for a second . i wanted to get those bonds .
well ... ... ... ... ... ? how many , approximately ?
... mathilda , i do n't feel like talking about this .
yes ... the beautiful carlotta ... the sad carlotta ...
what does a big old wooden house on the corner of eddy and gough street have to do with her ?
you fucking idiot ! why do you think i use you ? ... to be a walking advertisement .
i 'm sorry , mike . i never heard of lamarra flipping on anyone before . he said he had the cops paid off . antonucci never flipped on anyone before . he had the cops paid off .
he 's got your father upset . good thing he does n't have to go to work in the morning . is this what he deserves ?
ma ! please ! you 're driving me crazy .
yeah , maybe it 'll be okay . at least i 'll get to see every movie for free , i guess ... i had to lie and tell them i already graduated ...
when are you finally going to get your diploma ?
-- i 've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off . he just keeps coming back to the dam -- and what he knows --
saunders ! i 'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the brooklyn bridge --
yeah . two weeks . i did n't get to send you an invitation , but if you ...
that 's okay . i 'm probably , you know , busy .
i thought these things were for talkin ' around the world .
15-band closes down at night . during the day you can chew the band with china if you want .
you have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way .

huh . and here i had a completely different theory .
that 's not all . according to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year .
that 's great zydowski , you tech guys are really on the ball . harding - call the print lab at the fbi , run the prints through their library , see if it 's less screwed-up than ours ...
i love my country , i believe in music , what was i to do ?
look around you . see the country you served . look at people who had real courage , who took risks , who risked their lives . like emmi 's father .
we could 've gone out the back ! you did n't have to shoot !
stop it ! they found the truck , kev ! they 're already behind us !
i asked , but ya never helped nothin ' ! -- like the bible sez , ya do n't get no second chance .
rocky , i 'm seventy-six years old . maybe you can be the winner i never was -- your shot is my last shot !
well , um ... funny thing , your penguins ... they 're not responding to the launch command . fact they 're kind of turned around now ... like someone jammed our signal ...
but who could 've ... no , do n't say it .
because i 'm a good observer . because i have a tough mind .
i see . you do n't remember assaulting a police officer ... several officers ?
i 'm sorry , i -- i made a mistake . kid , i 'm askin ' man to man . i wan na be ya manager .
the fight 's set -- i do n't need a manager .
thanks . but i just want to take a bath and ...
that long neck -- the line of you ... you 're porcelain ... your back goes on forever . you 're classic ... you 're why cavemen chiseled on walls ...

that you did n't die ? like the other children ?
yes . like bear and the ansel twins and sean and ...
tell us what you 're going to make next , walter .
i 'm gon na make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen ... gon na make big statues and li'l statues , tall statues n ' short statues ...
yah , i got the money , but , uh -
do n't you fucking but me , jerry . i want you with this money on the dayton- radisson parking ramp , top level , thirty minutes , and we 'll wrap this up .
but it 's just my face you want to draw .
oh if it 's going to make you uncomfortable ... perhaps we can find something else for you to wear .
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ?
well , your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
may we stay here for a while ? we 'd like to rest .
of course you can stay . this belongs to the people .
by the way , jack , this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me , but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes , maybe up at the house ...
he 's all business , ai n't he , trini ? dick , we could 've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal . we brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
you 'd think they could at least send a ship . bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this klingon flea trap ...
we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap . it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot .
priscilla says they think any woman over who is n't married must be a lesbian . she figures they 'll be so relieved i 'm a man --
always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice . but marriage , man -- i did two tours in southeast asia and i was married for five years -- i could n't tell you which experience was worse .
no mortgage , no debts ; lock , stock , the sodding lot . . . do n't worry , i got it under control .
good , you can get this under control now .
what about rule one : never let the person you are protecting out of your sight !
rule two : without alternative , use yourself as a shield .
cause i do n't want to walk around with my head all nappy , looking like --
like what ? looking like me ? like a nigger ? ! why do n't you want to look like what you are ? what makes you ashamed of being black ?
that greek guy who won at the end . you paid him out in 25s not 20s .
i do n't cheat , jack . you 've got it wrong .
wait a minute , that 's no soldier -- that 's z !
z ? < u > our < /u > z ? the little guy made it !
wait . bullshit me a little ... i 'm beginning to appreciate it .
i 'm no suggesting the worst will happen ... but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe , the next time that happens , down the road -- you should look into it .
a unicorn 's been slain . the last stallion in all the country .
why then , there thou hast . we be lucky worse has not befallen us .
never mind that now . i also need some artillery , you know , a couple of sawn-off shotguns .
bloody hell , tom ! this is a bit heavy . this is london , not the lebanon ' who do you think i am ?
i find this as distasteful as you , lieutenant . but if it 's on my desk , it 's on my shoulders . there 's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty . you should prepare yourself .
sir , please ... if there 's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud ...
do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath ?
i was hoping for a kind word , little sister .
so ray and claude got their pardons , right ?
no , they did n't get their pardons , you dumb shit ! if they 'd got their pardons way back then , we would n't be burying them today , would we ?

`` a history of the united states , volume i . '' if you want to read a real history book , read howard zinn 's `` a people 's history of the united states . '' that book will knock you on your ass .
how about noam chomsky 's `` manufacturing consent ? ''
as usual , you want everything your way . except this time there 's more than your damned ego at stake .
i know only too well what 's in the balance , doctor . and it 's not my ego , damned or otherwise .
yeah , well ... you are the definition of mixed emotions . i really should hate you ... i see your movie 's getting good reviews .
it seems to be causing a stir . what 's with the toilet paper ?
may i offer you some tea , herr mozart ?
tea ? who wants tea ? let 's go out ! this calls for a feast . you do n't want tea , papa . let 's go dancing . papa loves parties , do n't you ?
no . it 's ridiculous . this has nothing to do with tom grunemann .
it probably has the dumper 's name . it might give us some kind of new lead . i want a look at it anyhow .
-- some prick from stanford that your parents will approve of . then you 'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin ' too .

the prison board made the decision . a board of which i belong . we 're the who . the why is simple . mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor 's care , where hopefully they 'll receive the help they need .
mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial . i 'm confused . what 's changed ?
murray had some ideas about the fire and ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs ... i think they 're kind of interesting .
i do n't . jim , this is n't anything like what we talked about . it 's not even close .

wade , that was n't smart . going out right after the man 's father-in-law shot himself . let it go . call it a favor to me .
well , it was just a dream , i --
sonuvabuck ! what 's with you , man ? who are you ?
funny , that 's just what i was thinking ...

just tell me who did it and i 'll go get him , baby .

please , mirtha . i 'll start working for augusto . i 'll talk to him tonight . i 'll do something .
he did n't say , sir . i told him i did n't know when you would be back , but he insisted on waiting .
come with me . and stay in the room .
with respect , sir -- it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests --
-- what < i > about < /i > his profile ?
my god . you even cooked up that norfolk trip .
it might have worked . really . i would have been delighted for you if it had . but she was n't interested . not my fault .
why do n't we send her to a movie -- like ben-hur ?
that 's fine . but what are we going to do about grandma and uncle herman and aunt sophie and my two nieces --
so you were n't interested in music at all ?
yeah , sure . more so then than i am now . that 's life though , is n't it ?
please -- if you ... downloaded ... everything about us you know the problems we face , the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
ellie ... this is the way it 's been done for billions of years ...
... it 's like a visit from my oldest , dearest friend .
i was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago .
hoity-toity ! john best , what 's the matter here ?
i 'll tell you what it is , mr. dugan . i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways . i ai n't used to 'em , sir .
well , why do n't you use your divine influence and get us out of this ?
i beg your pardon , general solo , but that just would n't be proper .
i know . somehow ... i 've always known .
then you know why i have to face him .
you dont know why hes come to los angeles ? the man you say he killed ? who was he ? a colleague of his ?
no . a poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer . he disappeared on his second shopping expedition .
not now , i 'm talking to the press . claire !
what ? i have a five-o'clock plane to catch .
i never believed you were a murderer . i knew . i knew you are a magico . i have seen it in you . it 's in your spirit .
i 'm tired , diego . go to bed .
thought you were going to turn in , inspector .
nervous . could n't sleep . feel like a nightcap ?
we 're preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking .
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me .
but it did n't stop . i know it did n't stop . granny told me it did n't .
no , siree , it did n't . and it wo n't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and union . so -- giddyap , constitution -- and let 's keep going , mr. stone .
i 'm going to be number thirty-two , like magic .
he 's alright , but my dad can take him .
this town is really going to hell lately . so what part of the city do you live in ?
i have an apartment . i do n't remember exactly where . my dog knows , though .
we do n't know if it 's random . we have n't been able to connect the victims .
the first two were stabbed without thought . the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .
go down to the office and arrange for some radio time .
why , d. b. , you 're not going to fall for
do n't any of your little pals have real , grown up names ?
he was a runner for top dollar . just muscle .
i 'm going to send them to my friends for christmas presents .
you think those are good presents ? who wants an old wig ?
anouk is n't like a dog , really . more like a small person . so is there anyone here for me ? no one looks new . who 's that ?
you do n't want that . it 's married and it 's the neighbor .
look i-i-i 'll be okay . i 'll be okay .
it 's not that big a deal . we just did n't hit it off .
the sounds , but not the language . we would be responding in gibberish .
is there any other planet where this species exists ?
jeez . and you think the british 'll share it with their allies ?
major richards said he 'd call to let us know .
this is every financial transaction ellingson conducts , yeah ? from million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas .
the worm eats a few cents from each transaction .

all our parents are weirdoes . i think my dad is into hookers . i know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid .
my dad acts like he 's johnny fucking perfect and he 's really johnny fucking rapist .
they 're pretty . learn it in the army ?
no - but when you 've torn out a man 's throat with your bare hands , you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life .
act surprised . walk slowly to the podium . be modest . thank them for this incredible honor .
that said , the whole point of an election is to choose winners , and that you have done . we 'll begin with president .
think , reggie , you 've got to think -- it may be what we 're looking for .
that money 's not ours , adam -- if we keep it , we 'll be breaking the law .
girls check in , but they do n't check out .
yeah . and they say smokin ' is bad for your health .
it 's the wicked witch ! what 'll we do ? help ! help !
it 's no use screaming at a time like this ! nobody will hear you ! help !
what 's the matter ? what are you saying ?
well , it 's just that i would think that the woman who is the real , non- imitation catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea . really angry .
well , he 's the steakhead of the night , then .
i do n't think the fire people can touch him out there .
i felt pretty low , sally , when i heard you were running around with a racketeer --
women have a curious taste for knickknacks . when i found out about ned -- tried to make a break -- lee would n't stand for it and -- well -- here i am !

it is only important what you are . an adulterer ...
i am the lord 's voice in this town .
you _are_ two-face , you would need to face both rivers , both uptown and downtown simultaneously . only one spot in gotham serves these bi- zonal , bi-coastal needs ...
congratulations . you get to die on the dean 's list .
cliches , mainly . do n't take anyone for granted . do n't sweat the small stuff . live each day like it 's your last .

ellie , you know i think it 's about time we got outa this place , get us a house of our own . we can afford it now .
amen to that . the supermarket 's full of assholes .
you did n't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues . you could give me something .
oh , i 'm sorry . did i embarrass you , sweetheart ? oh ...
what 's your shot in all this ? being a famous , anonymous , underground , pirate , cyber-journalist ca n't be much of a payday .
fortunately , my needs are met in that department .
wise guy , huh ? trying to louse me up -
and what are you trying to do to poor sugar ? putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent - nobody talks like that ! i 've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
same with me , pretending i was you . an impulse . why not ? i had this shoe .
there was this kid there saying , `` go in there and save my father , mister . '' and i 'm thinking about my boy joey and this goddamn fireman my wife 's seeing . it was like i was supposed to save myself .
there may be things you 'd rather not know about .

a humanoid robot is like any other machine , it can be a benefit or a hazard . if it 's a benefit , it 's not our problem .
but because your department ca n't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large , it 's a problem . correct , mr. deckard ?
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst !
she lives ... is n't that worth singing about ?
-- plus the forty to mason ... how many letters is that ?
that 's a book , baby . that 's a book of love .
may i ask ... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée ?
i think i just said . ripley was handling some business for me , nor does mr ripley want to marry me . nor did he ask me every day if i would marry him . and when .
darlin ' , you ai n't seein ' santos again , are ya ?
oh , johnnie farragut ... do n't you trust your very own marietta ?
it 's a little `` silence of the lambs '' for me . i ca n't believe you waited for the wedding to run .
he 's an entomologist ! i thought it was very unique .
let 's see if you 've gotten any better .
oh , i 'm worse . much , much worse .

but what 's the point ? how will any of this make you the biggest star in the world ?
it 's got a green dot on its back . i ca n't go to sleep with it watching me .
sounds awful . i guess we better check it out .
maybe you do n't know . i know you though . you 're jeffrey beaumont and i know where you live and i know ways to get you and i know ways to kill you .
please do n't talk like that . you 're upset . i 'm not helping you . i 'm sorry for what i did . i better go .

i 'm all right , if that 's what 's upsetting you .
you know that 's not what 's upsetting me .

last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir . maybe that 's what he was after ?
look , doll , if i wanted underwear , i woulda broken into frederick 's of hollywood . i was lookin ' for marvin acme 's will .
nothing you could n't find out from reading the papers . and you 're already wrong on one count .
viznick will get off and michael 's got a crush on you .
i 'm okay , honey , i 'm okay . are you alright ?
what 's going on , tom ? what happened ?
in nineteenth century france , workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines , flung their wooden shoes - called sabots - into the gears to stop them . hence the word sabotage .
we are experiencing a technical malfunction . all backup systems inoperative .
come on , frances . louella parsons is here . she wants to talk to you , help you out .
louella ... did n't she call me a spoiled little bitch ?
let me see if it changes colors on me .
ehh ... okay ... but be careful , it has a lot of sentimental value .
in case you 've never heard of how i lost all my money - and it was plenty , believe me -
the last ten years have been tough on a lot of people .
are you kidding ? you 're not kidding ? you 're not kidding !
you won it . you 're going to study at the finest institute at england , the toughest fellowship in the country , and you won .

because i loved jacqueline i thought i knew her . today i found out such strange things frightening things . i saw a hangman 's noose that she had hanging - waiting  i feel as if i 'd never known her .
at least i can explain that , mary . your sister had a feeling about life  that it was n't worth living unless one could end it . i helped her get that room .
nobody else is going down but me , okay ?
hey . bein ' ballsy with your life now does n't change what came before -- it 's just stupid .
not to his father 's ; i spoke with his man .
why that pale hard-hearted wench , that rosaline . torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
he wants me to go to cathy 's party tomorrow afternoon . i said i would .
i 'll be going , too , to help out . it should be fun , melanie .
yes , you do . you have to go rescue all those people ...
but i 'm not a hero . i 'm nobody 's heroine..i 'm nothing . you 've said so yourself many times .
i do n't know . i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life .
the pay 's the same but you 'll make more in tips .
right down to the kleenex i used . sir , why ? is something wrong ?
he mentioned a name , at the very end . `` mofet ... '' any followup on her ?
i think it 's very sensible in the circumstances .
now he 's gone and made me fall in love with him , which i never wanted to do . i told him that .
baby , i 'm in the middle of work .
i know but this is important . i have to make a decision .
of course . you were born two seconds after me .
and all the time i 've known you , you 've been grumping and groaning . you should quit making waves . go with the flow .
maybe he 's not quite as romantic as you are .
it does n't matter . there is no exit visa for him .
it is , i 'm telling you it is ! !
you 've told me a lot of things , boyo ...
lotte ! why are n't you at the pet shop ?
fuck pets . is this your partner ? i had to come back and do the malkovich ride again . fuck everything else . is this her ?
no . it was mine . i did n't want any more bloodshed . that 's why we went to all this trouble , so there 'd be no one for nix to come after .
nix is dead and buried , for fuck 's sake .
this is my grandson , sunny . he is my youngest son 's child .

no , it was n't only you -- it -- it just was n't my style . hey , look -- let 's go to lunch . someplace nice for a change .
this from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel ?
i know . you introduced jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
i should have known . she had no sincerity - no real belief .
i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker , you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick .
chick was outright killed by a mob . he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him , they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town .
ay , palequero . never hochi in the p.i .
wha-chu-say , palequero ? short time , long time , only ten dolla .

boy , that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom .
he knows better . sunny , apologize to harry .
if you do n't want to have a session today , it 's okay .
i want to have the session . i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me . but i guess you 're not into it ... which we already knew .
i do n't think so . no one has said 'whoopsidaisies , ' do they -- i mean unless they 're ...
there 's no 'unless . ' no one has said `` whoopsidaisies '' for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets .
i do n't know , conor . it 's not natural . maybe something has touched you .
you 're sounding like that mad woman , widow baggins .
no , i 'm awake . what 's the matter ?
buddy , i am wandering in a wilderness , lost . i just feel awful . do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while ?
it was ethan found you squallin ' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred ...
it just happened to be me ... no need to make any more of it ...
damn you ! what did you do that for ? he ca n't prove anything .
no , you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so i could go to a hanging alone .
bobby , we 're launching . see these submersibles here , going in the water ? take a message .
no , trust me , you want to take this call .
can i tell you something personal ? i feel like i can . it 's something i could n't tell john . or would n't , anyway .
it 's up to you . but i warn you , if you tell me something personal , i might do the same .
until then -- the dollar forty stays with me .
is that a nice way to talk to a pal ?
during the farpoint mission . we were on the bridge and you told a joke . that was the punchline .
the farpoint mission ? data , that was seven years ago .

i got some fuel comin ' out and , i hope , some automatic rifles .
oh christ , this really is n't worth it . and see , courtney , it 's there for what ? huh ? tell us . why is it pulled down half an inch ? so it can catch the force of the ejaculate !
well , it 's not a turn-on for me . i have a promotion coming to me . i do n't want to get aids .
< u > ben < /u > did this ?
he 's had some kind of ... reaction to exposure from the cloud . and he 's not the only one .
when ? when are you going to do it ?
tomorrow we meet at city hall at ten- - and you 're going to be on time .
your father did n't know beans about `` piggy-back '' riding .
my unclemother 's brotherhad four children . . . and i 've seen them ride `` piggy-back . ''
so why do you think i should work for the national security agency ?
well , you 'd be working on the cutting edge . you 'd be exposed to the kind of technology you could n't see anywhere else because we 've classified it . super string theory , chaos math , advanced algorithms --
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part . please .
okay ... then how 'bout we try out some french cuisine . saturday ? night ?

it 's a juice and coffee bar , man , like i been tellin ' ya --
i want a martini ! on this bar , right now ! i 've had a martini in every bar on the way down here , and i 'm not about to --
the least i could do for you , deanna . besides , you know me ... im a talking head .
and you need n't worry . i 'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know .
meeting rollo at tudor 's . might take a while .
does n't matter to me how late it is . i can keep it warm .
you are too gracious . these things have some merit , i suspect ... but this -- ... i am convinced , is fine .
even those delicate veins , the texture of this flesh -- i have never seen anything more exquisite .
you would n't understand . seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story .
but there 're so many wonderful things to write about , bob .
well , this big stake 's got to be big by now . when you leaving ?
see , i 've got bills . my mother 's been dying of the same disease since i was a kid .
calm down . why would they keep playing after you paid ?
you think i know ? i paid them < u > more < /u > to make it stop .
you need n't worry . it 's over and done with . a long time ago .
annie -- there 's nothing between mitch and me .
my angel . my goddess . i feel i 've always loved you all my life . i 'll die if i ca n't spend the rest of my life just looking at you , holding you in my arms ...
we have to have a long talk about all this .
do n't you see , x ? for the betterment of humanity , he 's going to start world war three .
he 's a regular humanitarian . and all this time i thought he was just a tool .
cleo , i 've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie ?
well ... uh ... they , y'know , uh ... they had nicknames .
i was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself . now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat .
definitely ! nolan , my boy , you 're a walkin ' distillery .
and bankruptcy . where will that put me in the social strata ?
i 'm only asking for one thing . and it 's not an extravagance . it 's not even for me ; it 's for our daughter .
yeah , honey , someday everything 's gon na be all right .
doyle would n't really kill you , would he ?
but you ca n't let her get involved now , ben . vader will destroy her .
she has n't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have , luke ... but the force is strong with her , as it is with all of your family . there is no avoiding the battle . you must face and destroy vader !
i do n't give a damn . it happens to be my name .
then what 're you complainin ' about ? at least nobody 's calling you shithead ... .
he had a partner . our own ray gallagher . he tagged wade dangerously defiant . psychotic . reckless . seems our commissioner did n't like him much . busted his buns on a narcotic 's violation . wade was sentenced to twenty-five years .
he went dirty and they made an example of him .
oh , will you help me ? can you help me ?
you do n't need to be helped any longer . you 've always had the power to go back to kansas .
just remember - you 're a target . do n't you think vince has a t.v . ?
i know , i know . i 'll be careful . i 'll try .
nothing . [ getting up ] thanks for bringing me this far .

well , you see , thomas i figure the big problem is the supermarkets . but patsy 's shop , that 's a specialized trade . the supermarkets do n't carry italian meat .
who buys italian meat anymore ? you think my wife buys italian meat ? she goes to the a & p , picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane , opens up a canna peas , and that 's dinner , boy .
i think i just really hurt ray 's feelings .
listen to me , julie . ray 's a great guy , nothing against old ray , but he 's so ... ray . i mean , he lives in southport . will 's a nice guy , too , and he lives right down the street .
i did n't mean it that way i 'm sorry .
oh , forget it . clark brandon 's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening . take me ?
so you want me to tell you the story of my life ...
that 's what i do . i interview people . i collect lives . f.m . radio . f.f.r.c . i just interviewed a genuine hero , a cop who -
i 'm not a lonely spooky writer like you . nursing a hundred grudges . i 'm a man who loves life .
we 're talking about something deeper than grudges . how do we respond to personal attack ?
they never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers . what if breuning and carlisle took them from the evidence room ? couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two .
we should check the records , and , we should talk to lynn .
where the hell was paulie , why was n't he with the don ?
paulie 's been a little sick all winter ... he was home .

i would take a pain in the arse for half a million .
you would take a pain ín the arse full stop .
dr. sheeler is leaving mumford ? i 'm sorry to hear that .
as you can imagine , my own feelings about this are mixed ... unlike , i must say , those of my wife .
what expenses ? all you need is carfare to long island . you 'd better get a shave and a shine , because you , you 're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is .
i know those bluenoses . their ancestors refused to come over on the mayflower because they did n't want to rub elbows with the tourists . so they swam over .
bud , that water 's only a couple degrees above freezing .
then i guess you better wish me luck , huh ?
ted , you are the best editor this school paper ever had . you do n't need to be pandering flesh . it 's nonsense . it 's beneath you .
you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? i do n't want your silly billion dollar empire ?
can we make this quick ? roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad . again .
well , i thought we 'd start with pronunciation , if that 's okay with you .
you guess he 's your boyfriend ? or you guess you 're having a bad time with him ?
what ? no . i do n't like the term boyfriend . it 's so gay .
and another thing . stop with this spaceman thing . it 's getting on my nerves .

i do n't know if whoopi is the way to go .
that 's fine , eddie . all in the line of duty .
no . seriously . i want you to know how much i appreciate what you 've done for me . a great man like you should n't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning .
unfortunately , while you told that stupid story , dr. evil has escaped .
no worries , luv . we 'll just give basil a tinkle on the telling bone ...
not saw , heard ... heard . i heard the brakes . wham ! and i got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er ... er joseph ... that 's joseph emperor joseph statue .

juno ? wow , i did n't expect to see you here .
i 've got something really cool to show you guys . is vanessa here ?

i wonder what time it is . seems kind of late .
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it !
look at me . these are n't lungs . these are ... tanks . how long can you hold your breath ?
you 're already contaminated . it 's why you could n't hear the tape . there 's probably a pentacle near your bed . to sanctify you .
i 'm not going to be drawn into this .
and this is my son , paul . he was only four years old when his father disappeared .
he 's coming back , mom ! he 's the bravest , most wonderful man who ever lived .
what 're you talkin ' about ? that 's your son in there .
he ai n't never known me , lula , so there ai n't much for him to forget . not seein ' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us , too .
this part is dream , i think . there is a tower and a bell and ... a garden below ... but it seems to be in spain ... a village in spain . and then it clicks off , and is gone .
a portrait ? do you ever see a portrait ?
do n't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach ? once a talent like yours gets into that mocambo- romanoff rut , you 're through .

what 's wrong , carl , you hardly ate anything ...
i took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach .
if it 's about the bikers , dear , i do n't want to talk about it .
no , i had a dream about daddy . do you think i 'll ever meet anyone like him ?
... my father did n't leave his room for years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano .
go ahead , simon . your father walked in on you and was yelling and ... really , come on .
yes ! you own the coffer of shadow . nothing can withstand its power .
i 've been saving it . for the right moment .
she does n't want me here . with you . in this house .
believe me , my old man 'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here . all he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible .
we have to find he rebels ... what we 're carrying belongs to them .
their bases are very well hidden . all the power of the empire ca n't find them ... do you know where they are ?
there 's only six miss dugans now ... poor dorothy .
good heavens ! whatever ? has she died of grief ?
you 'd think she was marrying him . what are you watching ?
children 's programming . what did your mom say when you told her you were n't engaged anymore ?
you could n't possible have traced it this soon -- not possibly .
of course not . thanks for telling me . i have n't seen mr. clarendon .
that 's right i did , did n't i ?
yeah , but there 's a call for you from this guy . he 's a cop .
i feel like a criminal or , like we 're cheating on someone .
just ... just relax . okay ? we wo n't do anything . we'11 just sit here for a while .
fuck you , man ! where 's jerry ? i gave simple fucking instructions -
where 's my damn daughter ? no jean , no money !
why , that 's just sense , son . now a man like daniel webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does . but he 's worth it -- and he helps others . makes all the difference .
i know , ma , but -- suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
what i 'm thinking is , we can drop down through tennessee , across arkansas and into texas , from there it 's a straight shot into california . `` we do n't stop ... until we hit the fucking ocean . ''
it 's about fucking time , kessler ! i 'd just about given up on you .
i 'm running late here . i just came back for my briefcase .
right . well , i wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh , to the neighborhood . i 'm claire spencer . from next door .
what did you tell her about the shop for ?
i did n't know it was classified information . i mean , i know we do n't have any customers , but i thought that was a bad thing , not , like , a business strategy .
can you tell us what 's on the disc ?
) there is one program with approximately million lines of programming . it is thoroughly secured , which is not surprising considering lindenmeyer created it .
i 'm having fun , what 's the problem ?
you have all this talent , and you waste it . you wo n't take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you 've got too much `` integrity '' for that .
well there . you do n't need me half as much as you think you do . you already know what must not happen .
i must find the means to save him , then . i was hoping i could ask you for a little magic help , but if it makes you so tired ...
i 'd better get back to my elevator . i do n't want to be fired .
oh , you do n't have to worry about that . i have quite a bit of influence in personnel . you know mr. sheldrake ?
mother , i have to tell the truth . i was n't reading huckleberry finn , i was reading one of those little dirty comic books .
oh , brother , i am so disappointed in you . you must n't look at those horrible things , they degrade the human image .
harry , what 're you still doing with those guys ?
he happens to be loaning me five hundred grand , no strings , i write any kind of agreement i want .
ninety degrees to the left , i hope . how does she feel about you ?
i think she 's disappointed that i 'm not more , ah , sort of atavistic . she 's got some naive , sentimental notions about indians . i 'm sure she liked me , though ; but ... . then she left town .
but you ca n't say with any certainty that the blood was his .
no , but as i say , the type is rare . ten percent of caucasian males .
oh . uh ... 'hey , you ! get your damn hands off her ! ' george paused . you really think i should swear ?
yes , definitely , god dammit george , swear . then you hit me in the stomach , i go down for the count , and you and eileen life happily ever after . now , hit me in the stomach .
we 're upstairs , george . now come on . behave yourself , and for christ 's sake , do me a favor . do n't let me drink too much .
you do n't do that anymore , do you ?
-- no , no , it 's fine . fine .

i know god help me , i know that , eli . but i tell you that if he 's found here , the people who did this to him will come for samuel .
yes it is . i 'm tired and i 'm no longer needed --
my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you .
it was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but i understand you 're a difficult man to see . i thought you 'd have the solution by this time .
not yet . that 's why i wanted to see you .
it 's my fault . i should have told you he was released a few weeks ago .
might'a been nice . like this is gon na do any good . maybe one of the frat guys has a gun .
hold on . hold on , please . i need talk to you .
it 's nothing to do with me . i was n't even with him .
no . there are things that i have planned with hyman roth . i do n't want them disturbed .

when we get this group down , i 'm gone .
you 're gone now ! i do n't climb with people i ca n't trust . why 'd you come up , to prove something ?
if you have such a low opinion of my abilities , how come we 're having dinner ?
i told you : i 'm a sucker for hard luck cases . besides , i want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that gracie is pregnant and calls you admiral .
al 's main squeeze . is she here ? i 'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue , right ?
my parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago . alfred has been supporting me ever since .
look . maybe this is n't going to work . maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone ... more sociable .
no , you 're right . you were hired to protect her , that 's enough . i 'm confident you 'll do that .
well , maybe i should dig around in other people 's clothes for money . it 's obviously been highly successful for you .
hey , you 'd be surprised what you find in other people 's pockets . just got ta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers . get you every time .

ca n't say . it 's something ca n't be planned .
you blaming god . that what you 're doing ?
the reason is margo and do n't try to figure it out . einstein could n't .
if i thought i 'd offended her , of all people-
they come on land and they 're brazen . they 're also attracted to noise , you can see i make a lot of it .
everybody out , back to your tents , < u > now < /u > !
daddy , what if the face comes when i 'm at mommy 's ?
your mom knows all about the face , okay ? do n't worry , she 'll tell the face to beat it .

then ordering fresh horses , the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital . i need not tell you that i was the chevalier .
i do n't know , yet . we 'll just have to watch our chance . when it comes i 'll know what to do -- i hope i 'll know what to do .
i still do n't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you .
oh , you look so cute as little elvis .
i finally knew what i wanted when i grew up .
why not , larry ? we could get a positive confirmation that way .
be reasonable , boys -- this is n't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish . ben ... do you have all the pictures you need ?
she told them you wanted her things and that she was n't surprised police looked for you ! can you believe it ? !
asshole . but she wo n't miss anything , that . you 'll see .
twill take more than heart . where do we find the armor of achilles , for a start ?
i know where to find it . taking possession be another matter .
you 're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man ?
no . i 'm going to be on that boat with sugar .
i 've had many ... when the sea does n't want you .
it 's never the sea ! it 's roberto , mamma , that stupid actress ... oh shit ! jacques , what do you know ?
do you know how many times i 've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me ? particularly while i 'm on my way to pittsburgh .
lay off pittsburgh . it 's one of the great cities .
running this place for a fella in town . nothing much to speak of .
well , i do n't notice us hustling trash , either .
this trip better be worth it . what 's the guy-girl ratio again ?
get ready to smile , five guys per girl .
so what did you think of the ballet ? was it like a warm ice capades ?
yeah , i did , you condescending fuck , but i miss snoopy coming out at the end . is n't your enjoyment impaired ?
brain damage could have been ... it did n't necessarily take nine minutes , it could have been caused in two ...
wait , wait , wait , you 're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes ... ?
well -- as i remember it , we had an argument .
and the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not .
ca n't do it . i can not do it .
external srbs , orbital system engines . its just like the shuttles you flew in --
yeah , right . that 's what you said about janet , and beth , and barbara --
puppy love . this time it 's real ! we can have a double wedding .
got any spare change ? how 'bout a spare twenty ?
look , i do n't have time for you , get out of my way ! !
if you have the same power as alex , you 'll be seeing signs soon . when you see anything creepy or ominous , an in-your-face irony kinda thing ? do n't ignore it . it usually means the difference between life and death .
the songs on the radio . but wait . i do n't understand . why is this even happening to me ?
do they have those ... where you come from ?
yeah ... i guess . i do n't know .
mister president , i ca n't buy this malarkey ; they would n't set the damn thing off . why should they ?
you 're absolutely right . we would n't . no sane nation ever would . that 's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically .
yes , i know but still , it should be somewhat entertaining .
i mean , without this footage , without this rigorous documentation , it would feel like exploitation .
not too big on it myself -- but then again , not on marriage either .
oh , he 's got no problem with that : i 'm his fourth .
... another question i would ask would be a very simple one . how did you do it ? how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves ?
an excellent question , doctor . but what if we do n't like the answer ?
fifteen hundred . we 'll have to stop somewhere to refuel .
we 'll refuel in the bahamas . i know someone there .
you did that deliberately . you knew all along i 'd like them . it was a trick .
i tricked you into meeting some people you 'd think were great . i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way .
shit ! damn dog . we gon na have to do something about you .
what we have to do is call the police .
hey , come on , i 'm grown-up . what 'd she say ? i mean specifically , doctor .
well , specifically , mrs. macneil , she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt .
you 're a couple o ' sticks shy in your column , ann .
a big , rich slob like d. b. norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off !
all right . i 'll come for dinner . and in the meantime ... you 'll think about what we discussed ?
in a week ... we will never have had this conversation .
i 've been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen .
you 're not with the fbi or anything , are you ?
i 'd say that about torches her credibility , would n't you ?
yeah , well , if the wife 's trying to sell it she 'll fuck up . she 's an amateur , just like del was .
i am still owed money for this play , burbage .
not from me . i only stole it . when are you coming over to the chamberlain 's men ?
you decided what you were going to do , charles - some time ago . you ca n't always have it your own way , regardless of anything else that may have happened . come on , charles .
go on ! get out ! i can fight this thing all alone !
i suppose i always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody .
what are you talking about -- you 're not a nobody ! that 's the last thing you are .
i do n't know . i think that a power grid just needs reset . do n't get your panties in a bunch . i 'll go down and reset it .

i ca n't ! i have n't got it !
i do n't want to be buried alive . if i die i want to be sure - quite sure .
if you should fall sick we 'll be careful . you need not worry .
you have the power to do it . i want you to do it . please .
i explained this . i ca n't . that 's not the way it happens .
drunks . crawfished a bet , called him a liar . i saw the whole thing .
sheriff , may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates , turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion ? watch your ear , creek .
i suppose . but they got here first , the lousy bastards . so now it 's all over , i guess .
i do n't know . there 's a small community of us . we have a place they do n't know about . we 're happy . we 'll keep trying to figure out a way . come stay with us . join the struggle .
thanks . you read my mind . third watch always seems to last forever .

but maxine , i thought it was me you loved .
turned out to be a scoundrel , eh ? i saw that one coming .
you lose trust in someone and it 's over , done , gone , forever .
so now i got all those coffins on my hands - and i hate to see them go to waste .
honest , spats . i had nothing to do with it .
where are you going ? just -- out of curiosity ...
just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs . nothing fancy .
funny , i thought it was a strong point .
write me a note and ai n't she sweet . i need a hand and where 'd she go .
and they 're sure he did n't get tangled under the outboard somehow ?
hank < u > says < /u > he 's sure .
sommer ? herr sommer ? but the man 's a fool ! he 's a total mediocrity .
no , no , no : he has yet to achieve mediocrity .

i seen the light . i figure somebody was home .

huh ... i do n't know . they got howard johnson 's there . i do n't know why the fuck i 'm going there for .
howard johnson 's ... you 're warped . you know that ? you 're really warped !
everything 's smooth . beautiful . i will need a few more days though , the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there 's no heat .
you must take me for an imbecile . why do you think i asked you to meet me in washington ? i have n't spent five minutes in new york city without the company of a gendarme .
you mind your own business ! she 's an old friend of mine and i like her -- what 're you going to do about it ?
just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her .
really . i mean it . i-i 'll never play the piano again .
you 're really nuts . i do n't know , you really thought it was good ? tell me .
never been out of it . i 'm gon na beat that fat man ... with that curly hair , and those diamond rings , and that carnation .
this boy 's crazy . they wiped the floor with him . they beat his brains out and he wants to go back . what for ? to take another beating ?
and that 's why you 've got to get rid of this money . if you keep it around , it 'll just make you think how clever you are . it 'll be a temptation to get back into the game .
oh , that 's it ! you 're stealing my money for my own good ! how very motherly of you , lilly .
this is serious . nobody can know . ah , i 've returned from the future . i traveled back here years .
you probably are crazy . wait a minute . is this some kind of joke ? i know what you all , think of me .
you 're thinking about killing him . i ca n't do that . no way . i 've never killed a man . never even shot at one ...
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note , or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .
women are such fools ! -- why do so many of us pass up < u > right < /u > guys ?
guess they 're dull -- nothing for you to reform .
you 're all wet . miss mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff .
they ca n't , huh ? who do you think writes 'em ? my aunt emma ? i know she writes them .
yes , i understand  but where do you take them from ?
where ? do you ask miles where he got that note from ? where do you take your words from ? everywhere .
of course not . who wants to ? whats the point if we dont get caught ? wheres the glamour in that ?
the way i see it . well be arrested . go to prison . cash in on the home footage . secure a book deal . if all goes as planned , our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii .
all right -- bring me a side order of mrs. wheeler . oh , hell -- sit down , colonel . penelope will bring you some chow .
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips .
sam the bookie ? nothing doing ! you 're not putting my overcoat on that dog !
i told you - it 's a sure thing .
lord , how my head aches ! what a head have i ! o , my back ! other ' other side , -- o , my back .
i ' faith , i am sorry that thou art not well . sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
zebra , are you there ? i 'm holding an unconscious at first and st. marks .
no ! it 's three o'clock . that can only mean one thing .
in case there 's some escaped psycho killer on the loose , who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us .
oh yeah , sure , thelma , that lantern will come in real handy . maybe we could tow your car behind , in case he steals the spark plugs .
impossible ! you will bring famine down on the people of tibet with these insatiable demands ! more food , the best land for your soldiers to camp .
the people 's liberation army pays for all food and lodging .
he left us . we were no longer of use . saavik where is the reliant crew ? dead ?
marooned on ceti alpha v. he 's completely mad , admiral . he blames you for the death of his wife ...
it seemed like she had such a good time last time .
it 's nothing you did , mom , believe me .
and then she mentioned penis envy ... did you know about that ?
me ? i'm-i 'm one of the few males who suffers from that , so , so ... you know .
well , maybe it 'll only be temporary , but i ha -- i have to try .
oh ... lee , you are my whole world . good god ! have you been kissed tonight ? !
[ do n't jerk a jerk-off . there 's nothing in the bureau mainframe . ]
not everything is imputed to memory . the most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy . why would the zero file be kept secret ?
luke , do n't talk that way . you have a power i -- i do n't understand and could never have .
you 're wrong , leia . you have that power too . in time you 'll learn to use it as i have . the force is strong in my family . my father has it ... i have it ... and ... my sister has it .
tom ? only how ... how if you did n't ... did n't come back in a week ... how we was to take half the money to sally an ' say you was ...
well , i come back , did n't i ?
no , no . i come every couple of years . i always think i 'm going to stay . i 'm from cape town originally
i was born in the transkei , on the wild coast .
hey ! take it easy . want to get us killed ?
you do n't know what it feels like to be free of that place .
i do n't understand . do you want my autograph ?
no . i think my film is perfect for you .
you 've got the wrong idea about me . i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger . can you help me find him ? i 'll pay you anything .
yeah , i 'll bet you would . you got ta have the rabbit to make the scam work .
what ? excuse me ? ... you 're kidding , right ?
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman ? he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park ... ?
i ... i do n't know what your name is .
minor problem . the rules . i ca n't tell it to you . but ... do you know how to play charades ?
i do n't want to go to mexico , bobby ! please , i really want to be with you . do n't blow this . do n't you think i care about you ?
i think you 're a lying , back-stabbing psycho bitch , and one day you 'll kill me . but it 's nice to know you cared ...
addison , just a few minutes ago . when i told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything i wanted-
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars ...
there 's really no need . this is just a scrapbook . i should feel obliged . thank you .
and that would be unconscionable , i suppose , to feel any obligation ? yes . of course it would .
you know , i really was n't expecting all this .
well ... i guess they did get a little carried away .
i just got a call from terry haight . bob thomas is nervous ...
that 'll happen when you 're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin ...
< u > that 's < /u > the worst possible moment ?
what could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl ?
why because it 's not my fate ? it 's not in the book-of-all- knowledgefullness that i 'm gon na be cheerleading at the barber game ?
sooner or later you 're going to have to accept it . your fate .
hi , wan na help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow ?
ehh ... i do n't know i mean ... .
he does n't look like his picture . i bet he 's fake .
now go get dressed . we have things to do .
okay , reggie , start bustin ' my chops ... tell me how great you were with that chick .
hey , jack , real men do n't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but i was fantastic .
i 've told you : i ca n't afford to garage it .
are you kidding ? you buy enough gourmet junk every week ... most of which < u > rots < /u > ... to garage a fleet of stretch limos .
professor claude rousel . the one your uncle was working with . he teaches cultural history .
in an underground club ? i 'd like to see that .
darlin ' you were 'bout that far from spendin ' the night at the morgue . you understand ?
he was n't going to shoot her , you murdering son of a bitch !
a lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice . what is she trying to prove ?
could be she 's just a nice , respectable girl -- there are millions of them .
evone tells me : i shoulda been in , fi , six , months ago ... . thizz my first checkup .
gon na be fine . you ask your momma .
well ... i suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on broussard . is that what you mean ?
and right next to it , that oval design with the markings -- it 's a dead ringer for the spore casings .
i thought i told you to lose this guy .
look , sergeant i know i said some things last time that i should n't have said at all but ...
what are you , an idiot ? did n't you see the red light was on ?
ah ... yes ... but , i did n't realize that --
... so she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on ? and i think fuck it ... .
are you shitting me ? ? right in the store ?
they tortured us . and you 're going to let them have all that money ?
so far they 're keeping their part of it .
we ought to be getting you back , mother .
hold on a minute , dear . here 's us at mount rushmore . you remember , truman -- when dad was still with us - that was quite a drive . you slept all the way there .
well , are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion ? you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke .
i know . women now , i guess . the commercial says they help women now .
excuse my presumption , but i do not agree . as a teacher on a training mission , i am content to command a starship . if we are to go on actual duty , it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command .
but it may be nothing ; garbled communications . why do n't you ...
that pump was full of money . i saw where they put it . stay right here , i'mma climb in and go get it .
wait here ? so cheeco can bite my ass off ? tell me where it is i 'll do it .
you knew mitchell pretty well , did n't you , mrs. west ?
i was in love with him ... which shows you the quality of my brains . why do n't you ask her about the gun ?
i do n't know ... how it keeps on coming . it just keeps growing .
yeah -- lucky for us , huh , pal ?
are you sure you wo n't have a drink ?
no booze ... pain 's in the mind , and the mind i can control . alright , let 's do it .
i 'm going to see what the hell happened .
looks like the only one who got screwed here was you .
he never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first . understood ?
you smooth son of a bitch , let me lay it on the line for you , and your boss . johnny fontane never gets that movie . i do n't care how many dago , guinea , wop greaseball goombahs come out of the woodwork !
oh , i 'll call you up some time . and if your social duties permit - why -
cut that out . just because i 'm married - there 's no reason for that .
for the < u > worst < /u > hurt , of course , that which will not heal , is the conviction no one cares .
i 've come to see you , sir , about an auction ...
i am not going to look at any more pictures . they 're like a disease . they get into my head . i ca n't get them out .
i do n't look at pictures . i look at the < u > real thing < /u > . i do n't feel infected .
at last she arrives , my hard-won bride ! hurry , my child , and scurry inside . there you 'll find such treasures await you ; marzipan and meringue to sate you !
such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity ; how lucky i am to receive his charity !
on his heels ! gillette , bring a squad down from the fort ! elizabeth , are you --
yes , i 'm all right , i 'm fine ! go capture him .
what do i tell the rest of the class when they ask about you ?
tell them that everything is going to be just fine . it is up to the children to save themselves these days . because the parents ... they do n't have a clue .
it would seem that grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack .
you mean , we 're stranded down here ? !
we should drown that damn jack in the vat !
now , now , darlin ' ... jack just needs to know what business he 's in .
if she runs , then it 's a cover story . all true . all accurate .
okay , you were right . i hated my column , but i can do this assignment .
it 's a lot of ground to cover . we 'll try . funny coincidence , huh ?
no such thing as coincidence . `` god does not play dice with the universe . ''
and here i thought `` anarchy '' was just something cool to put on a tshirt .
come on , xander . you used to stand for something . what happened to you , man ? i thought you 'd get it .
listen cat , i 'll have you know that i hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player .
well that 's good news for us . it means the system is outdated . this should be easy . c'mon .
only asking . i did't know you were planning a comeback .
i hate that word . it is a return . a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen .
now i know you 're drunk . i 'm going home . do n't annoy me any more .
for heaven 's sake , joestop being an editor for just a minute . we 've been friends for a long time , have n't we ? you ought to know when i 'm serious . this is on the level .
you do n't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !
does n't surprise me . i meet a lot of people like that .
no . he was my brother . he died at anothers hand .
we too are brothers , macleod . in fact , you have more family than you think .
it is time to clarify the situation . everything is over between us .
but you can do the same thing in six months . the next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life .
the lazy fuck just did n't bother to look her up .
that sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai .
i 've noticed ... do you understand what they 're saying ?
not all ... but it feels like a kiss .
i 'm going to tell them everything i know . i 'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m .
you tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we 're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands .
i ai n't ever gon na fight joe louis , that 's what 's the matter .
what 're you talking about ? he 's a heavyweight . you 're a middleweight .
i was there , and it was no suicide . he was killed by professionals . i was in the bathroom when it happened .
did n't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room ?
i did n't want to get it messed . i got shoes too . wan na see ?
that 's all right . i 'm sure they 're quite lovely .
i would just want to clear some things up :
thank you , muffy . funny thing is : this is an important element of , `` seduce and destory : '' `` facing the past is an important way in not making progress , '' that 's something i tell my men over and over --
till it 's not funny any more . what do you want , jack ?
you know that super bowl party ? they changed the date . it 's on < u > tonight < /u > , eight-thirty .
you 're hanging on better here than you did in america .
this is a different situation , dr. jones . these people are like children . we have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century .
the dogs have lost the scent , mr. pendergast . maybe we should head back .
not yet . let 's try the fork to the left .
is there a fuckin ' point comin ' up anytime soon ?
seein ' he loved the experience so much , i think we outta give him the pleasure again .
you 're not listening . he is n't better . he gives pleasure , but that 's actually a weakness .
danny , what makes you think you know all this ?
well , then forget all this stern dad stuff .
i 'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now , lady . let 's go . right now . you and i can discuss it on the walk home .
no , something worse . he says it 's a surprise , but i know him . this is his masterpiece .
we 've got to find out what it is . can you handle that ?
with respect , sir , many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes . maybe he 's just unlucky .
i do n't like anybody < i > this < /i > unlucky . widen the sweep . the west side . draw a five mile radius around gattaca . hoover some of the classier establishments . random car stops .
i just has a terrible thought ... what is this is all a dream ?
then kiss me quick ... before you wake up .
a war against the railroad . what the hell were we thinking ?
i 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time .
this is all maybe getting a little too strange --
-- i would n't worry , ms. jenzen : the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long . in the meantime , let 's all relax , have a drink , the evening 's young --
did you get anything on the cameras . video or anything ?
no . look , forget it . i do n't want to talk about it .
leah just told me you were going with her .
yeah , i did ask her if she wanted to go . a bunch of us from the team are going to benihana , then the prom , then vijay 's parents ' cabin .
i am not going to expose that little girl to that ... pervert down there .
but < u > we < /u > let him out .
no , no , not tonight . do n't let her in here . i have too much to do .
yes , sir . i 'll talk to helms , and , uh ... what 's our press position on this watergate thing ? what do i tell ziegler to tell them ?
and your billing address and the name as it appears on the card ?
... ..1274 moorpark . sherman oaks , california . # . .
i do n't even have any friends anymore besides you . and everyone says `` warhol ? that death-warmed over person on drugs ? he 's just using you . ''
gee . you should n't take it so seriously , jean . that 's why you ca n't stop taking drugs . you always think people do n't like you . everyone likes you .
whatever , at this point all i care about is food . i 'm starving and i got a fucking killer headache .
hey , i asked you if you wanted some chicken .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
nay , he will answer the letter 's master , how he dares , being dared .
cometary debris , pockets of unstable metreon gas ... we do n't want to go in there , sir ...
yes , we do . you 're relieved , ensign . take over at ops .
but -- why ... that would be an awful thing to do , sir .
perhaps , major . perhaps . pour me a scotch and soda , please . and help yourself to whatever you like .
i 'm dying , claudia . i have cancer . i have cancer and i 'm dying , soon . it 's metastasized in my bones and i --
fuck you . fuck you , you get out .
cindy campbell . classic abandoned personality disorder . she seems guarded , but willing to do this .
willing ? i like that . and , this one ?
i 'm not lying to you , i 'm not --
fuck you . you get the fuck out of here .
i < u > tapped < /u > you .
well you < u > should n't < /u > have . how did you even know where i was .
if he was trying to kill you , you 'd be dead .
who ? who is he ? what is he ?
those trees were very young when i first arrived .
are you related to the deceased , mr. chance ?
you know , marty , you were good in the cyclone .
martin . it was a beautiful role . all i had to do was find the character 's center , the stem i 'd used to wind him up and he 'd play , man , he 'd play .
right . except ... time has a way of --
no , harry , it 's not time , it 's us . you and me . and i 'm telling you now that i 'll come to you , okay ? i 'll find you . i will .
and old man clarendon ? he had a motive , too . margo and her money .
mitchell was killed down here . how could clarendon get in to do it ? or margo for that matter .
okay . please , i have a headache , all right ?
hey , you are in a bad mood . you-you- you must be getting your period .
right . in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for salt lake city and the new driver will take ... ... this part . when you get to salt lake city , ask the driver , 'las vegas , please ' ...
'las vegas , please . i do not speak english . ' what is hitchhike ?
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums . it was a famous case .
and did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against burke ?
i 'm in love . for the first time . it 's funny , but when it happens to you , there 's no question .
he 's a lucky man . do i know him ?
now then . what did miggs say to you ? `` multiple miggs , '' in the next cell . he hissed at you . what did he say ?
he said - `` i can smell your cunt . ''
oh , so you 're in the big shit now ! child abuse . people go to prison for what you just did to me .
my dad used to play a game . i never really understood what it was until after he was gone .
i ai n't dense . and he 's been here twenty minutes .
well , i certainly think it 's odd he has n't even come up ...
if you 're right i 'm gon na back you a hundred percent , you know that .
fuck you , sir - if i 'm right , i do n't need you . what i want is - if i make an honest mistake i want help .
i ca n't believe i 'm really here . no kidding . if you 're through work now --
no . aaron and i go to central america on wednesday -- so i 'm cramming .
gee , that 's an idea , gallagher . that 's an idea there . i wonder now ...
oh , sure . she 'd make a beautiful heroine ...
what did you have to test , for god 's sake ... the dental don juan of detroit ?
don juanism is just a cover ... i 've been reading up on it . i 'm a fake , i 'm a fraud , i 've been living a lie !
no . i graduated from george washington university . then i entered the agency training program .
they did n't give you a choice , did they ?
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted .
see ? you 're impertinent , rude , sarcastic .
but she worships you . your mother 's dead but your father 's alive .
nothing you could n't find out from reading the papers . and you 're already wrong on one count .
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
o , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do . they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
hey , watch your mouth . do n't talk like that . she 's still my wife .
no , but jake ... how much abuse can you take .
cool off , beautiful . did n't you see the sign says `` dimout zone ? '' there 's a war on , you know ?
come on . you 're seriously trying to tell me the japs ca n't find los angeles without my headlights ?
i 'm really sorry about last time . he just flew in -- i had no idea -- in fact , i had no idea if he 'd ever fly in again .
no , that 's fine . it 's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major hollywood star . it was a thrill for me . how is he ?
c'mon , jordan . do the headwork with me .
it 's done with , royce . let it go .
if she pisses you off , you get another one .
do you know what she told me last night ?
do you have anything to eat ? i do n't know about anyone else , but i 'm starved .
how can you think of food at a time like this ?
and you make it disappear , you know what i mean ?
yeah , just let me know . but you got ta be ready . you know what i 'm talkin ' about ?
where 's the fire sweetheart ? do n't know how they work things in nevada , but we got speed limits in this state .
vat ? i am going miles an hour ! i am looking town . i not even moving .
oh come on , < u > you 're < /u > the one who came after me -- the swarthy , earthy , sensual worker !
i was < u > slumming it < /u > ! i danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place !
which part ? the colonel 's ? or yours ?
a piece of advice , mr. bond : do n't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton . it 's deadlier than uranium .
he 's going after debbie , i got ta stop him .
hey , you 're not alone . we have to stop him , i 'm with you .
it seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks .
ayegor ! find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can .
well , guess i do n't even need to be here ...
get your dick back here . it has everything to do with you .
nothing ! jesus ! i got ta fight with you now ?
who 's fighting ? why are you so defensive ?
... it 's inside and it eats and eats until there 's nothing left .
`` the dark inside ... '' ? i do n't understand .
hey , lcokit : < u > any < /u > business ...
ai n't < u > that < /u > the truth .
well , if i had to guess , i 'd say it was some ol ' gal , some ol ' gal 's husband . but it was n't either one of those two . the tall one , the redhead , she left me a huge tip .
you did n't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving ?
i 'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show .
i 'm afraid not . i ca n't make it tonight .
really , wow , so it 's really a real thing .
yeah , it 's a tree . i used to play there all the time . but , you ca n't find it without me . outsider ca n't find no deadwood .
god , stacy , it 's not that sad . it 's just david soul and ricardo montalban .
i do n't know , i 'm just so depressed . everything is just so ... depressing .
you heard of albert milo . i made that niggah . i 'm rene ricard . did n't you read `` not about albert milo ? '' i know who to hype . baby , i 'm gon na make you a star .
can you put me in the ring with him ?
yeah , that 's good too ... the whole record was good , but that one song , `` devil got my woman '' -- i mostly just keep playing that one over and over ... do you have any other records like that ?
the skip james record ? yeah , that 's a masterpiece . there are no other records like that ! i actually have the original of it in my collection . it 's one of maybe five known copies .
you know what ? this is good . this is terrific , and i 'll tell you why : it 's < u > cost effective < /u > . this is ... .
it 's < u > producing < /u > .
i guess part of us never really leaves high school .
you know , i never told anybody this , but i always had a feeling that when you die , before you go to heaven , you get a chance to fly around high school for a while .
hey , ok if gordy uses your old gear ?
i think it 's somewhere in the closet ... if you can find it .
i do n't think so . be happy to show you .
would you mind if we took a stroll on our own ?
fighters have rules too : friendship , trust , integrity ... without rules , we would n't survive for long .
i 've read all about people like you . roaming wild , beating up anyone who gets in your way !
i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me .
you will never behave like that again ! do you understand ?
sam , if you owned a useless business like this motel ... one you probably could n't even sell ... what would you need to get away , to start a new business , somewhere else ? forty thousand dollars ?
how could we prove ... well , if he opens a new motel on the new highway ... say , a year from now ...
first , let 's get something straight . we ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime . if you want to kill yourself , mr. case , there 's much more entertaining ways than working for me .
it 's the people close to me that tend to die ... and i get the feeling you and i are going to be real buddies . terms ?
i wo n't be a party to this . i want to see brad .
the question is , does brad want to see you ? quite frankly , he hates you .
what is it , gilbert ? tell mother ! what did he say ?
he said that father 's in town . he 's been seeing julia right along .
there 's something dangerously wrong with this ship , elaine . i know its the wiring . that toilet 's just the tip of the iceberg .
ted , a toilet 's not going to kill anyone .
that trick tonight , i do n't think i 've ever seen that before .
it can only work with amateurs , a pro would have spotted it .
bam ! that walker colt blew up in his hand ... which was a failing common to that model . now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end .
you ... you mean ... english bob killed him while ... ?
pure nonsense . this wo n't prove a damn thing .
thought you 'd feel that way , garry . you were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma ... ... we 'll do you last ...
he does n't need the money . he inherited a fortune . he kills for kicks . tv battles between non-predator fish and divers . the diver always wins .
okay , forget him now . i 'm going to pick up sean . take a ride ?
[ this is not possible . but in that house i have money . if i tell you where -- ]
[ your brother wants to talk to you . ]
yeah ... they closed me down for a coupla weeks .
that 'll work out just fine . when this thing is over , i 'll take you to catalina . how does that sound ?
you remember jeff rawson ? -- we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high .
sure i do . went off down to mexico or something ...
buck duff . i was in maxwell 's boost in troy .
you the duff that did n't come up with his end when little jeff was sent up ?
i 'm already rich . but i like action . that 's one thing i think you 're good for is action . besides , like i say ... you got talent .
yeah , you already told me that . you cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk .
you may be our only chance . i do n't know if i can do this again .
what 'd you do ! just pick my number out of the air ?
you would n't have understood , even if i had tried to explain . you know ... you 've gone as far as you can go . i hid my skills so as not to hurt you .
if i had n't seen you fight with li mu bai , i 'd still be ignorant of all you 've hidden from me .
right , lester . i heard you the first time . i 'm not a dummy .
did n't mean to imply that you were , sir .
yes , but that 's an added service a firm like cedar , cedar , cedar and budington usually donates .
budington . funny , i ca n't think of a rhyme for budington yet .
please complete this sentence . i want to be citizen because ...
i want to be a citizen because ... well , because of my girl , sir .
theyd never let me go . and youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me .
you can not walk away from this . you can not .
i do n't ... i do n't want to answer that ... look we 're friends .
you do n't find me cute ? come on , look at these muscles .
i ... i was defending myself as best i could ! everyone has the right to defend themselves , do n't they ? or should i have let myself be killed ?
no , no , you did fine . i 'd even say well done . besides , most of the ones you killed probably deserved it , do n't you think ?
not like < i > this < /i > one .
honey , look around you . the world does n't want one like < i > that < /i > one .
you mean you do n't want to go to a movie ? there 's plenty of movies around here .
no , i do n't feel so good . we 're just two very different kinds of people , that 's all .
why should i be afraid of you ? what are you holding over me ?
i 'll tell you what , toddy . it 's because i ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood . it 's because you were afraid to face it -- and you 're still afraid .
these men were taken from their homes at night , tried by reed 's courts -- which congress recognizes -- and , well , you can see .
cut those men down . congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial . benedict , trust me to handle this .
oh , my god ! ouch ! no wonder you quit .
well , that 's the thing . she landed on her feet . did n't even sprain a toe . and i go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she 's like this --
so far , you have four and i only have two !
then , take blood parasites . it 's yours . now we each have three .
i know i got you into this , hildy , but it does seem to me that you ca n't care much for me if you 're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours .
bruce , you know i 'm mad about you and stop talking like that . walter !
tommy ! the guy 's a sleaze-bag . she ca n't sing .

he 's an ass that 's gon na try .
he thinks i 'm guilty , does n't he ?
i do n't know ... you got what we need ?
if i do n't , i ai n't going back to get it ... you think we 're safe ?
i 've said i 'm sorry about the old woman , but from the behind you looked ...
what i object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
his landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to .
i do n't think he really had any . he had no family either .
i 'm your basic underachiever . ca n't stand working and porn does n't seem like a good option .
good quality porn has it 's place in the world .
you 're a wonderful man . two o'clock is a good time . here 's the key in case he 's asleep . open the curtains for him , so he sees god 's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best .
where 'd they teach you to talk like this -- some panama city `` sailor want to hump-hump bar '' ? or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey . sell crazy some place else -- we 're all stocked up here .
if i 'd made more money ... i threw away so much money , you have no idea . if i 'd just ...
there will be generations because of what you did .
yeah . you , too ? oh , joe . . . oh , i 'm sorry darling . . . why do n't we tear the building down !
before you do , ann , perhaps you 'd better finish this column .
you know i never stop you from anything . believe me -- you 're at a wonderful age . in ten years you 'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again .
ten years ? now , dad -- i need an answer now !
skinny lunger , your guns do n't impress me . was n't for those guns you 'd be nothin ' .

i got ta get back on top . get off the sleaze detail .
you will , one day at a time . i 'll be old and grey when it happens ...
are n't you gon na go over and talk to him ?
nah . sit tight . he 'll be over here .
how many times ... .it 's ok ... just say ... just say ...
i do n't even remember ... many ... twenty ... maybe more ... not much more ... twenty times .
sir , you 're gon na have to leave . you mind accompanying us outside ?
bullshit , i ai n't goin ' anywhere with you !
they know about us . they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses .

but -- what 's this ? i thought you were going along with me .
oh , no , no , i have to get to her right ... .
lydia 's trying , but they do n't believe her .
she 's got < u > photos < /u > , barbara .

the audition was called for 2:30. it is now nearly four .
no , youre right . what are we doing ?
we 're being responsible . go . get on the plane .
we only owe the king a hundred and fifty .
we get fifty percent . and we get clear of the king .
this part of town , they 'll make us for heat the second we walk in . just back me up like you 've got a piece ...
back you up ? now why would i wan na do that ?
i prefer it to & quot ; instead & quot ; , it has more dignity .
in lieu ... & quot ; instead & quot ; ... . no contest .

i thought you were giving up that drug shit .
soooo ... dorsia is where jean wants to go ...
oh , i do n't know . no , we 'll go anywhere you want .
but lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate !
come on , i do n't see you living in a cave !
habeas corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime .
okay , then let 's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car --
it 's your choice . because it 's not safe for you to be awake . to be walking around . to be thinking about things .
it 's not safe for you to be either .
the mother said the boy had n't slept for over three _months_ . a physical examination showed dilated pupils , temperature of one-oh-two , blood chemistry highly imbalanced ...
that 's pretty weird . is it possible for someone to not sleep for months ?
that 's eight years of school and training -- after college . and all that does n't necessarily make you a better human being .
i could do it if i tried . even kelly thinks so .
you know , i 've been thinking about what you said yesterday , about the orientation film being a cover-up . i think you 're on to something .
and fifty other lines to get into a girl 's pants .
well , now -- i would n't know about that . mr. president -- what happens to me in the morning -- i mean about my having this floor to go on babbling ?
if the senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else , unless he is recognized first by the chair .
please tell me i 'm gon na get to see the jets win the super bowl .
me , right ? that 's why you 're not saying .

relax , james . i 'm not her father . i just rent her a room .
she likes old movies like i do , that 's all . besides , she does n't really know me . she thinks she does , but she does n't . maybe it 's because she 's mormon and i 'm catholic .
keep me belly full , jack . kill us another worm .
hush up , screwball . do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well .
the jews are n't the middle , henry . they 're the far left .
you 're talking too much about black africa , henry . it 's killing us with the rednecks .
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system ... our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness , which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo .
we captured the plans in a raid on the imperial shipyards , but we fell under attack before i could get the data to safety , so i hid it in this artoo unit and sent him off .
yeah ... huh , thank you . i 'm going to go back , sonny , to the hospital . they 're really nice people . they 're really trying to help me .
that 's good then . you 've found something .
you sure you do n't want to quit , friend ?
let 's cut out the small stuff , huh ? hundred dollar freeze-out . ten games , ten bucks a game , winner take all . and then we 'll see who quits .
get crucial . we wo n't be using blanks this time .
you ca n't be serious ? hey listen , my bonnie-and-clyde days are over .
i must be gone and live , or stay and die .
that light is not daylight , i know it , i. it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua . therefore stay yet . thou needest not be gone .
he might be weird -- he can talk more freely if i go alone -- why 's that so hard to understand ?
it 's not that it 's hard . i just want you to give me a minute to catch up .
yeah ... you just want me to wave , right ?
wave from the door ... go down the stairs ... get into the limo ...
i do n't know . just should , though . somebody should kill 'em . nobody 'd miss 'em .
god . i know where they should have a commune for you . they should have a commune for you at bellevue .
it 's a week . we did n't know where you were - or if you coming back , or -
you should be happy . what were you going to do for him when it ran out ? he pulls out more phials from his jacket .
i do n't know , i just thought it was interesting .
you know what jerry , who really cares at this point ?
the faster you get doucet , the younger you 'll be .
i 'm going to kill you when this is all over .
perhaps the reason i hated bases loaded is that i knew your name . i 'd always heard you had some talent .
that was last year . this year i 'm trying to earn a living .
give it to me ! please . i got ta know it 's all there !
you just sit tight , old man . we 're gon na have to get you to a doctor . i 'll call a cop .
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ?
he 's only just dead . what was i supposed to do with him ? i ca n't take him away anywhere . and nobody wants to take him for me . do you ?
i do n't think that 's a good idea .
i said out of respect . respect for you fisher . for you and your wedding and your beautiful bride . there will be no more rain . you see where i am here ?
we have a lock on the event horizon 's navigation beacon . it 's in the upper ionosphere , we 're in for some chop .
bring us in tight . starck , get on the horn , see if anyone 's listening ...
thinking like that is only gon na drive you nuts you were a great star and you had a good run . that oughta be enough .
yeah . but all of a sudden it 's not
one more night and you 're finally rid of me .
yeah , you 've been pretty tough to take .
i 'll be back as quick as i can . thirty-six hours at the outside .
try to get a second radiator , we 'll bury it between here and the pottery hill . and a better jack . we planned badly .
you come all the way out here to watch walter ?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .
what a pleasure , governor reynolds . i 'd like you to meet some of our staff here . .
and that 's where you introduce me to the governor .
guns ! you never said anything about guns . a minute ago this was the safest job in the world , now it 's turning in to a bad day in bosnia . . .
jesus , soap , stop being such a mincer . i thought about that and ...
huh ? oh , no . this is n't emily 's . i just write in it .
i guess there 's probably a story behind that .
i 'm wondering why the hell he has n't shown up .
he ca n't hurt us , michael . it 's us - our love . he ca n't find a crack in it . he ca n't find a way in .
we 'll make do . i 'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then --
no , calvin . we 're not going to make do . not me ! not adam . we 're going up no matter what ! we deserve it . even if it 's terrible !
she has the face of an angel . what a pity you ca n't see her .
right , let 's go . and keep the compliments to yourself . i do n't like them .
i 'm sure that ai n't the only place he 's sticking those pencils .
naw , he do n't do anything else with 'em , but he did get caught once with a planet of the apes doll hanging out his asshole .
why would i want to see you , of all people ?
i do n't know . but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was , and where i lived and ...
way to go , dude . if you will it , it is no dream .
you 're fucking twenty minutes late . what the fuck is that ?
mom , i was there , and i just , i was so ... they did n't have the olives , and i , i got so upset . i do n't know how it happened .
i 've talked to doctor emlee , and he says ...
devon ? he looks like seattle slew . what about the triple crown ?
he 's not a racehorse , bud , he 's a jumper .
it 's getting dark and cold . i 'm tired .
why do n't we rest here ? we know we can eat these .
i ... i doubt i enjoyed it any more than ... detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows . is n't that true ? how happy would it make you to hurt me , with impunity ?
now ... i would n't do something like that , johnny . i like you . i like you a lot .
do n't be . i do n't care if they expel me . i probably should be expelled .
well , let 's see if we can keep that from happening .
as much as i do . it 's not that . i do n't want to be depressing , that 's all .
i see . if i know how you really feel , i wo n't like you as much .
i tried to make you understand . the suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust -- surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power --
it 's not your government i 'm thinking about . it 's your world .
it certainly would . germany ... vichy would be very grateful .
then release him . you be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves .
de fool think he 's gon na get it but he ai n't known for his thinking .
he 's a fool alright but you a bigger fool . hey , whiteboy , watcha waiting for - dat hole ai n't gon na dig itself ...
connections and politics , it 's the same everywhere .
my old man , he bought into the system , and it screwed him . so he swallowed a bullet . me , i do n't believe in nothing i ca n't see and touch .
ahh , look , right now 's not very ...
i woulda ' been here sooner , but ballard put me in jail . he still thinks you had del scalped .
of course . in fact , i 'm there right now .
what do you mean ? you 're where right now ?
i 'm not a stalker ! she 's a friend of mine .
sure she is . that 's why she got an unlisted number and you have n't heard squat from her in a dozen years . oh you 're good , ted . you 're a real piece of work .
i know more than i want to know about it . who 's the father ?
do n't trouble yourself about it , homer -- this ai n't your business .
i know of no one . but even if there is , i am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with ?
anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- i 'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em .
what if these tracks are just leading us to an indian village or some old coot 's mining claim ?
not likely . there must be tracks of twenty different wagons . freight wagons , carriages , buckboards ...
i think you should give up diving . it 's dangerous .
do n't be silly , i 'm the best in the county .
it 's been so long i do n't how long ?
quite a while ... an hour , an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that 's quite a while , is n't it ?
well , i ... i ... ah-h , let 's see ...
it 's dave wilkie ! i 'm dave wilkie , do n't you remember me ?
we ca n't begin this way . let me turn on the light .
but i thought vampires did n't like the light .
maybe mike should n't get mixed up in this so directly . you know the old man does n't want that .
ok forget it , just stay on the phone .
the zapruder film is the proof they did n't count on , lou . we got ta get our hands on it .
that means we got ta subpoena time- life on it .
just settling an old score . you might say revenge .
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that 'll land us in jail .
where 's my damn ammo ? nothing is ever where it 's supposed to be around here !
how did she die ? i wan na know .
that 's for blasphemy . the quest for the grail is not archaeology . it 's a race against evil . if it is captured by the nazis , the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth . do you understand me ?
this is an obsession dad . i never understood it . never . neither did mom .
it 's really pretty outside . how about taking me for a walk after you 've finished your breakfast ?
oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first .
i feel terrible about what happened . what did he say ?
he -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty .
one thing i 'm not completely clear on -- when you gave out the money to liddy , how did that work ?
badly . you do n't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered -- i gave liddy the dahlberg check and he gave it to barker who took it to miami and deposited it .
tell me , dr. schwartz , what do you feel you can bring to lestercorp ?
well , sir , i 'm an excellent filer .
oh ... pretty well , surprisingly ... you know ...

i see ... and why are you experiencing this paranoia ?
well , you see , i 've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since , when i was in korea ...
i was just leaning on it ! it was an accident !
does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose ?
jesus , george , fifteen percent . that 's an extra two-hundred large .
i do n't give a shit . split it up . have a great life . i 'm done . i 'm out . starting over . cheers .
and there is a russian saying : `` the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses . ''
with our cream situation what it is , it is russia which should apologize to the cats .
your father has a few final words for you . you know , he 'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much . we both do .
heck , i know that mom ! you 're my parents .
do n't worry , i 'm not going to hit you .
no , about scobie , i mean . i ca n't think of any reason why he was killed .
i ca n't do that . not while the joker 's still at large .
then stay away from vicki . that 's all i want , man . i just want your word .
so what are you going to do with your share ?
oh , i do n't care about the money .
i told you not to call me hudson . the only people who called me that were the nuns at ...
oh hudson , i 'm a sister of the catholic church as well as an agent .
must have been hell , huh ? zero cool ? a virus has been planted in the ellingson mineral computer system . you were our prime suspect , till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it .
however , we have come to believe that one joey pardella is involved in this ellingson virus . he or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that mr. belford needs to disable that virus . we want you to help us find it .
to front for him . so elliot is workin ' out the deal between them and his boss , a big movie producer named lee donowitz .
he produced `` coming home in a body bag '' .
guess you 're not quite as invulnerable as you thought .
you 're wrong -- a few minutes more , and my transition will be complete . even your sword wo n't be able to affect me then .
but you must ! i ca n't do it alone . i 'm not at all like my father . i 'd never make it .
i already know you think you 're worthless . i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light , for what you believe you are is what you become . i have n't been involved in anything like this for many years .
the ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. distance : three light years .
signal the closest starship . we 're in no condition to mount a rescue . we do n't even have a full crew aboard .
wow , you musta seen some things , huh ? what 's the worst thing you ever seen ?
you learn to sort of block it out , you know , like cops fence off a crime scene . but then something good will happen and everything will just glow .
what , you could n't have just left the thing in your car ?
it sticks out , so i ca n't lock it . look , angelo , you think i joined the fbi to learn to surf ? this was your lame-o idea in the first place . you got ta back me up on this .
but how am i to know the good side from the dark ?
you will know . when you are at peace ... calm ... passive . a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense . never for attack .
i feel like a mole in this joint , so i guess i might as well come out lookin ' like one !
do n't worry , i 'll give you a hand as soon as i can .
oh right , right ! she fell down , like a ...
yeah , a thing . he became a big hero . he was on tv and there was a parade and a movie about him
she knew she could beat it . that 's why she asked to take it .
how the fuck do you know ? what is it with you and this broad anyway ?
would you like to take me there , so that we can get warm , sir ?
uh-hh ... yes , of course -- if you would like to go ... there ... but ... i have very little money .

mr. shakespeare has given me the part of the apothecary !

they 're saying i 'm a communist , sandy . but i 'm not , you know that . i 'm gon na fight 'em , and i 'm gon na win , but i 'll need your help .
serious , that 's what 's important to you ?
yes , that 's what 's important to me ...
i have still a year -- a year to make up for everything .
oh no , you violated clause five of our contract and i could collect right now , if i chose .
liane , this is a preliminary ... you did n't tell her we were taping ? what did she think she was coming to new york for ?
... to talk about it . to think about it . i had a plan to ease her into it . but , i really -- i did n't know how to do that ...
oh , i 'm just typing up a funeral notice , you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually , it 's a service we provide for the family .

i know . i hardly have any time to study .
< u > you < /u > called < u > us < /u > , doctor hudson .
yes , i did . poor impulse control . the accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man , but you kept announcing they were unrelated . you 'll never catch him that way .
no , it is china , my country , my history . if any of it gets damaged ...
hey , do n't worry . nothing 's gon na happen to it .
that 's very clever . do you know any other poems ?
'milk , milk , lemonade . round the corner fudge is made . stick your finger in the hole , and out comes a tootsie roll ! '
mickey , you 're off the hook . you should be celebrating .
can you understand how meaningless everything is ? everything ! i 'm talking about nnnn -- our lives , the show ... the whole world , it 's meaningless .
well you guess what . the mayor sent me . i have your mr. barrenger with a history of ...
... a history of < u > nothing < /u > , he was acquitted ...
he lies . he is here to trap us .
i came to see you safely out . check for yourself .

i have to get back . i 'm having dinner with the danvers .
but the deal 's already done , i already got the money -
yeah , but we have an audit here , i just have to know that these vehicles you 're financing with this money , that they really exist .
sure it does . it 's like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father .
but this is life . this is n't a movie .
forget it -- i did n't do it as a doctor -- i did it as a neighbor . by the way , whatever happened to her ?
you know me with girls . easy come , easy go . goodbye , doc .
it 's never too soon ! girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes .

oh , shit , bill , i guess nobody 's gon na come clear from texas .
they really got all that money , them whores ?
... do you really want me to forget about you ?
i do n't want to drag you down with me .
i want to feel something else than this . it 's either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire . unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm .
i 've only got a couple left . i 'm saving them for later .
cards are on the table . what do you think ?
if you mean what you say , i think we 're in the ball park . i 'll take it to my people .
no , i have my things in the car .
then stay and have something to eat before you start back . i 'd feel a lot better .
you 're out of your depth , trautman . way out . i 'm acting correctly here . not you . not your gung-ho jungle ace . it 's over . walk away .
it 's not over . you made one mistake .
i know you 're trying to help me , but you do n't understand .
< u > then explain it to me < /u > . i got enough darkness , do n't i ?
please do n't raise your voice . i wo n't bother you about it again .
sorry . look ... you seem like a nice girl . i 'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money .

oh no ! there is nothing ! i have everything , you have given me everything i could possibly want . i am happy every hour of the day . i only wish there was something i could give to you .
only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both .
dallas , ask your own manager - he 's standing here like a pained wolfhound - hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife . so how do you get him doing j.j. a favor ?
no , that 's not , i could n't ...
listen , when someone does the kind of thing you did , you got ta do something in return . so , you stay with me until you find your david and live happily ever after . okay ?
you know , i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne , maybe get her on the rebound , eh ?
when it comes to women , you 're a true democrat .
oui . now you 've got me talking french .
i was in my p.j . 's when i remembered i left some papers i need to go over . see ? i rushed right out of the house . i must look a mess . i 'm so embarrassed .
in english , please . i did n't spend ten years protecting the president so i could finish my career feeling like an idiot .
i 'm sorry , sir . we caught him by surprise , so we do n't think he had time to erase his computer files .
thank you for coming . i 'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly .
one thing at a time . we do n't even know what it is yet .
but i do n't want to be like that . i want to do something ...

i guess if there 's one lesson i 've learned , it 's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target . i forgot your question ?
senta . we have to ask you to stay in rome .
yes , if it 's going to help , certainly .
that kind with the garlic and the oil that i like so much ?

you got ta calm down , paden . everything will be put straight in a few days .
i saw how you 're putting mal johnson straight .
they 're going to come and visit you in here ?
yes ... that 's what i pray for ... !
in return for doug 's freedom , i was never to see him again , i had to - it was his only chance .
josh did n't get doug out of jail , he did a deal in return for some computer disks we 'd held onto .
maybe . though it did n't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it . almost like ... did i say he was class officer ?
almost like someone put him up to it . okay , who ?
full of beans , ai n't you ? but you know that you 'll stand or fall by what you 're doing now ...
calculated risk . only we happen to know , j.j. , that you like me . i 'm your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent .
hi , ben . what are you doing with yourself these days ?
oh -- not too much . taking it easy .
you never really talked to me . i wanted to talk to you , man ...
yeah ... i guess i just wanted you to know , we couldve been really good friends ...
i 'm tired of this game . please play without me .
but my penalty . i 've got to have a penalty .
yeah , take us back to the dumbwaiter , mac .
i 'm not going back in there . i told ya this was a one way trip . now stand aside .
i ca n't believe it , daddy . i know it must be true , but i ca n't believe it .
it 's true , son . the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead , she is no more ,
he ca n't drink this milk . it 'll make him sick . he 's on a formula . i was a fool ! i should n't have kept him with me .
do n't you worry . we 'll get some action .
bird ! ask me the name of my sailboat --
i do n't know . what 's the name of your sailboat ?
you ca n't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow* -- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is ?
then i suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him !
i 've got to write some of this down .
that 's why it 's my fault dan 's dead .
so ... smell ... is ... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories . and a memory can trigger a smell .
i was n't thinking about my mother 's bathroom .
i told you , i 've already lived my life . i do n't know how or why i 'm here , but you have to help me get back . i want to get back to my real life !
all right , i 'll work on it , i 'll , do some research . but in the meantime , do n't get crazy .
really , captain , it was a lovely toast .
the least i could do for you , deanna . besides , you know me ... im a talking head .
i have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation ; the terms are not established .
if i may , your majesty , i would like to offer a dissenting opinion .
the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake , build fires and provide every comfort you desire , alice ...
duncan , you are absolutely gallant . if cora does n't marry you , i shall .
of course . shemp is unaware that anything even happened , other than his stool suddenly falling over . we had to wait two minutes to catch up to him , but for shemp the trip was instantaneous .
professor , can this thing send shemp back in time ?
all they got is advertisements . just like l.a .
did an exploratory and according to them , she needed an overhaul .
it 's too politicized with you in there , anyway . they need to be able to stick their necks out .
it 'll be the principals , a couple of the key guys from each department : the executive committee of the national security council . we 'll call it excom .
come on , gim me some more details . how 'd it happen ? some fuckin ' drunk kill her ?
no . it was a rainy night , the brakes on the car were n't great . she had to stop suddenly . she slid on the road , she crashed , she died .
why you in such a hurry to get to shooting ?
i 've got to have something to tell people when i get home besides i protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place .
some cash . jewelry . the other stuff i can replace , but there 's a cardboard box ... photos of my mother . they 're the only ones i have of her .
we 're doing everything we can to find these people . right tony ?
well , maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at computer station . normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience , but she thinks she can convince them .
tell her to forget it - i do n't need her help .
hey , toyota . he asked me a question .
frankie lazzaro . coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media . children see this . they think you 're the secretary of the treasury .
so tell me more about this job . what exactly will you be doing ?
well , mostly archival research , cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their cd reissues . it 's really ... i ca n't believe it .
no dates indicated , placed on the shelves in no discernible order . it 's just his mind poured out on paper . i do n't think it 's going to give us any specifics .
looking around ... i 've got a bad feeling these murders are his life 's work .
no one 's gon na hurt you no more .
you think god forgives people like that ? you think god forgives people like me ?
if you start in on the war metaphors i 'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole .
look , i 'm as worried as you are --
thanks for the invitation , but i have my own apartment .
you ca n't work in an apartment where you owe three months ' rent .
you have all this talent , and you waste it . you wo n't take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you 've got too much `` integrity '' for that .
i do n't wan na go mersh , you know that . but hey , if this is about money ...
but she must want to stand . she must want to walk .
confound me , the child 's a cripple , of course she wants to walk . child , i say to you get up out of that chair and walk .

i 'm bleeding , bill , i 'm < u > bleeding < /u > ...
i did everything you said , but it all seemed --
-- melodramatic ? things are past that -- remember , these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city .
that do n't make sense . you gave your word to my husband to kill me ?
your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm 's way . instead , he used you to try to save himself .
i not only say it , i 'll back it up twenty buck 's worth .
you got yourself a bet , georgia boy . you 're a witness .
her credit cards . how far am i gon na get with that ?
far enough . maybe up to san francisco . or st. louis , someplace new . start over .
al least a contingency for wardrobe . any woman can go up a dress size .
-- i guarantee she wo n't gain an once . she 's very disciplined .
can i stay , sir ? i 'm willing to risk it . i am . after what we just witnessed .
what ? no , i know they 're civilians ...
you 're lying ! you were after the evidence . who put you up to this -- the manager ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about !
i want you to get out of here , norbert . harold -- i want you to sit down in the chair , and not lift a finger until norbert is gone .
whoever has the gun , you see , gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do . it 's the american way .
there 's a girl i want to ask you about .
you 're not vice , are you ? do you work for the los angeles police department , or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency ?
every one of those times i was being supportive . something you wo n't understand .
supportive ? you were n't being supportive . you were being scared . just like now . you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on .
no , it 's okay . i just ca n't believe i left it out in the open like that . crabtree has n't been in here , has he ? poking around ?
i do n't know -- maybe -- i do n't think so .
you closed it , did n't you , grace ?
i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up .
fats knew the game was in the clutch , knew he had to do something to stop ya . he played it smart .
i played that game , bert . in my head i played it a thousand times .
what happened to her , where did she go ?
do n't know -- just that she was afraid --
it has not been used yet in this prison . the governor has grave doubts about it and i have heard that there are very serious dangers involved .
i do n't care about the danger , father . i just want to be good . i want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness .
yes . i do n't know what else to do -- with him following us . why do you keep running from your --
because he 's my friend -- and i do n't want to be killed by him -- or anyone .
who would you call , mr. cole , who would straighten everything out ?
scientists . i 'm supposed to report in to them . they 'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time .
one of the fathers was on the tv saying , `` my child was not a bum . '' and it 's playing like gangbusters . hell , hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph .
shit , the press does n't care about the facts . cronkite 's sticking it to me . it 's their first big hit on richard nixon .
i wo n't be back . i 've requested the atlanta run .
elaine , not yet . i promise you i really can change .
paris is evacuated , sire . the enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning . the national guard is on duty at the gates .

bud -- i thought you wanted to come home .
oh ... i do . yeah . it 's just that i told my `` dad '' i 'd clean out the rain gutters and mr. johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon ?
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show .
rocky , would you be interested in fighting apollo creed for the championship ?
... like i said , i 'd make a boss sparrin ' mate .
you know i burned all his shit . all that vinyl . chalamar , funkadelic , i burned his turntables too . they was like three-thousand brand new .

buddy , you do n't realize it but what you 're doing is n't nice .
the content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms . really , omniplatforms . including whatever new hardware emerges .
it needs a more object-oriented language . this does n't scale , does it ?
they 've got no right , sending someone to sit on your shoulder . i work for you ; i wo n't take orders from a stranger .
you need n't worry , valcour . it 's administrative , nothing more .
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you . i thought that earlier in the diner . that 's why i was looking at you . you work at borders , right ?
ucch , really ? you 're kidding . god . bizarre small world , huh ? yeah , that 's me : book slave there for , like , five years now .
you know what he 's like . he just wants to work on stuff that 's cool .

you want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet .
exactly -- you 'll go up the nung river in a navy p.b.r . -- appear at nu mung ba as if by accident , re-establish your acquintance with colonel kurtz , find out what 's happened -- and why . then terminate his command .
about time for you to come home , amy .
but mrs. farren just started to tell me a story . please .
i can well believe it . i 'm sure he has done , son . he 's about as straight as a dog 's hind leg .
but i ca n't be sure . i do n't even know who he is . he 's too insulated . too many layers around him .
that 's what you said in turley . you remember how that ended .
what 's the matter , paden ? you afraid i could n't get those two behind me ?
frankly , my dear , i did n't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl . what are you driving at ?
i heard the servants talking about someone called mama rose . they said she had been `` mindless '' ...
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was .
cowshit ? are you sure the aztecs even had cows ?
then you know why i have to face him .
no ! luke , run away , far away . if he can feel your presence , then leave this place . i wish i could go with you .
and you ? still a pig . just a much fatter one .
no reason to get nasty . yeah , i 've stayed in the organization . but then again i never got the percentage you did .
yes , well , from the department 's point of view you 're certainly a bit of an own goal , but ...
i 'm not a terrorist ! you must know that ! i 'm not guilty ! get me out of here !
this does n't sound like the luther stickell i 've heard of . what 'd they used to call you ? the net ranger ? phineas phreak ? the only man alive who actually hacked nato ghostcom .
there was never any physical evidence that i had anything to do with that.. that.. with that exceptional piece of work .
they wanted to know if we 'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night . they wanted to know if you remembered anything .
but i do n't remember anything . what did you tell 'em ?
we are trying to stand out . right near his address . easier to get them to come to us , than to try and find them . ..now keep your eyes open , something might present itself .
i 'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country . i do n't speak their language , they do n't speak mine . i do n't even know where i am . what 's going to present itse ... ... ..
not one i should like to rely on . francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after austerlitz , and he is under great pressure to recover his losses .
my dear talleyrand , none of the kings of europe bear any friendship for france . it is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties . the only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones i have won on the battlefield .
wait a minute -- i think i can cut something else out . `` back in four weeks . '' instead of `` in four weeks '' -- say `` next month '' -- that saves another word .
right . here 's eighty cents . send it .
fate worse than death ! well , it 's been real , boss , but i got ta go buff up my resumé . anybody here need a figment ?

you think i should hang around more with the crew ?
well , i always heard you do n't `` learn '' leadership , you earn it . how did you know they 'd get into the vodka ?

okay , great , grunick -- easy shots now -- huh ? good night .
the thing is , i made a commitment . i said i 'd do it and i have to keep my word .

everyone knows what we look like , dennis . we wo n't be able to hide .
jesus , first mars , now you . you two need anti-depressants .
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot , right ? they do n't waste time ...

you do n't . < u > think < /u > so .
he was heavy , but we were real careful . but i do n't remember him hitting anything , anywhere .
you 're here because you figured i might show up .
it seemed like a possibility . what about your intentions ? are they honorable ?
we have an enlisted man 's club at the post .
well , you 're the man out there now , are n't you ? it 's your call .
you think bad , and bad is what you get .
that 's a good piece of advice , darrell .

general faceman , what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson ?

and i 'd take it in a second , norma -- only it 's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in dayton , ohio .
and now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages ?
in return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them .
jesus christ -- why did n't i know about this ?
because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur .
i know who you are ! is n't it your picture in the newspapers ? did n't i see you this morning on the video ? are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique ?
yes , sir , that 's exactly who i am , sir ... and what i am ... a victim , sir . mr. alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses .

i 'll take the shades off . just get this fuckin ' thing off me .
nick 's a nick , n ' it ? no matter what state you 're in . state of remorse , most likely -- for gettin ' caught .

you see , vicki , i just heard about this today , you getting married that is , and i was kind of taken aback . kind of hard to believe .
all of us did . there was this whole line of people ... whole line of ceos up there all swearing .
part of the reason i 'm here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated , at least within brown & williamson 's representation , clearly misstated ... what is common language within the company ... we are in the nicotine delivery business .
are you going to lie for him , mother ?
betsy , tell them about the houmfort . tell them what you saw there .

tsch . rea- all this happened in the first hour ?
if i tell you , will you arrest me ?
arrest you for what ? why would we arrest you ?
you 've been working in that video shop too long .
and all that gore better had n't be interfering with your schoolwork .
holds up a loaded fork . pauline reluctantly takes it .
do you think juliet could stay here while her parents are away ?
but alone ? we always had great success together , you and i .
just a little bit too much , i think .
in any case , i do n't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel .
sewing mailbags ? me ? never did an honest day 's work in my life , dear . was n't about to start when i was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands .
i 'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week . we 've got some `` red-flags '' to cover .
it must 've been tuesday . he was wearing his `` cornflower-blue '' tie .
please . i 'm sorry . i 'll see it through . what do you want me to do ?
i told you what to do . drive around the corner out of sight of the house . i want to get a closer look at the place .
that 's not a contradiction at all , sir . i went to the meeting , but i did n't go as a member .
well , then , as what did you go ?
i 'm gon na gut your ass in a second .
did you really put her liver in the mailbox ? i hear they found her liver in the mailbox .
we can not break free , captain . we do not have a fraction of the power necessary .
delay that order , scotty ... ! disengage all main drive systems !
once a file 's been sent to the caste , is it possible to recall it for review ?
of course not . only by a director of the firm . who 'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets ?
your passport ! what kind of a proof is that ?
would you like to see where i was tattooed ?
what are you doin ' ? you got ta get out of here !
hey , sammy , tell this jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker .
if you do n't want me to pose for him , why do you want me to meet him ?
purely personal . i believe you might enjoy one another .
a locker at the airport ? jesus christ , harry . tell me you 're not really that stupid .
the guy 's setting you up . you pulled out of their freaks deal so he 's paying you back .
i do n't know -- they 've always been there .
that 's stupid ! plaster ! it can still be used .
we actually got a phone call . busy morning .
work , work , work . virginia ? when was that blizzard ?
oh ! so , my little friend , you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night .
no -- i -- wanted to speak to ralph . we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind .
hell , now 's the time to buy it off him cheap .
we ai n't gettin ' married with his ring ! you said you 'd changed !
fred , i do n't know what to say . a thing like this almost destroys a man 's faith in human nature .
i wish you would n't talk like that , pete .
but ellen , i told you i have stopped ...
but for how long - what will set you off again ? you 'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round ...
sometimes i think he is fooling us with that crazy business .
yeah ? how would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane ? c'mon joey -- do n't be afraid .
... and that you do n't really try , except during the playoffs .
the hell i do n't ! i 'm out there busting my buns every night .
better than i 've ever been in my life .
really ? great . still `` remaining men together ? ''
someone will follow . when you come to the lock , he will tell you how to go on the other side . jessica may go with you as far as the lock .
no . jessica goes back now . take her back . now ! go on back . back outside , jessica .
some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview ... where you 're saying you were on the american judo team in the olympics ... ?
what kind of shit is this ? i was not on the team , i sparred with the olympic team ... okay ?
no kidding ... panda . where 'd that come from ?
panda ? i 've always liked giant pandas ... i 've been to china and seen them in the wild . that 's the kind of thing i can do if i want ... now . i can do pretty much anything i want to do these days .
oh , robert , i 'm sorry . we were so tired from the branding . grace barely made it to her bed and i did n't have the energy to take my clothes off .
oh well ... branding will do that to you .
first they told me he had died at birth . then your father admitted he was alive , but well cared for , in secret . but the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner .
i am king , mother ! and i do not wish to discuss this with you .
i 'm afraid his car is gone , mrs. fortune .
i do n't understand this ... i do n't understand this one bit . he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby . somethin ' bad has happened - i jus know it .
jesus christ , stay here , do n't move , stay right here --
all i wanted ... was to make it home ... for a little of dad 's turkey , and mom 's stuffing ... aunt lisbeth 's acorn gravy ... aunt mary 's cranberry buns ...
[ because he 's outside . because he 's not tied to the same system we are . ]
[ we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings , including the little girl . the same man 'the dreamer ' . listen to this . ]
he 's gone . do n't worry . his name is welch . he do n't come in to my place no more .
oh  welch . that 's what i get for praying .
i , uh , do n't really know any . we - -
well , i 'm afraid i do . there 's one , a particular pebble in my shoe . he represents my investors . he says they insist on outside opinions .
oh ... a lot of things . several different factors . will you see her , doctor mumford ?
sure . why do n't you bring her up to my office at tomorrow afternoon .
is it ever embarrassing , having your bum kissed in public ?
if your ass is n't chapped , you are not a good-writer of note .
of course , i do n't know , but i think it 'll get darker before it gets lighter .
do -- do you suppose we 'll meet any wild animals ?
mommy i 'll get bigger and bigger every day and then i 'll pop but ... but if i stay little it wo n't happen .
your mother tells you this ? ... agnes your mother is dead .
wait , wait ... wait a minute . iris was here ? !
yeah , she came by last night . shaking like a junkie , wanting me to make a copy of some clip .
nice going , ray ! what were you trying to do -- drown me ?
look , zeddemore , it was n't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line .
i wo n't tell you more about that . i 'm more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you ...
you 're afraid of displeasing god when telling the truth ? !
what 're you now , a desperado ? put the guns down .
i told you , i 'm not going back .
they used the hex chrom here , in these cooling tanks , as an anti-corrosive . then they dumped it here , in these six ponds .
i do n't remember seeing any ponds up there .
i 'll call the cops for you . you 've got the number on the fridge , right ?
thanks . just give them the time he called . they 're keeping a list , supposedly . sorry . my nerves are so raw these days .
hey , there 's no reason to use that kind of language !
good one , captain rob . he does look like a you-know-what .
tell me , m'sieu laval , what else is wrong ?
everything ! ... madame colet , if i were your father -- which , fortunately , i am not --
connecticut . i told the office i 'd work out of there next week . when are you planning to start back ?
probably first thing in the morning . it 's too late to start now . i 'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark .
and now ? i mean , murders on your set and still you say nothing ?
get real , that would make me a suspect !
was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie ? yeah , it was .
excuse me , did you say an instant of purity ? what was the instant of purity ? the bodies you left behind on your bloody trail ?
she went front-office on you . tighten that for me , right there . that 's it .
well , you know lindsey , too damn aggressive -- son of a -- ! !
you do n't put up with that ! nobody has to put up with that !
you do if you 're where i am . where you want to be . how 'd you get that punch in the stomach , roy ?
they made her so sleepy she could n't work .
throw out all this junk . burn it ! this room crawls with tropical disease .
oh , you know ... i talked to hannah this morning on the phone , and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend .
yeah , she loves to go out in the woods .
look , it 's a fairly straightforward question . you 're either divorced or you 're not .
ok , i 'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- i 'd like you to name the song , the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band .
sir , the president does not call this particular number . so whoever you are get a life , before i have this call traced .
you do n't understand . this is an emergency . let me talk to anyone .
you fucked carlton ? see i told you he liked you .
no ! not fucked him , i think i killed him .
i 'm sorry for upsetting you , [ beat ] but i 'm not lying to you .
you ca n't be william starks . he 's dead .
dick ... and my mother ! she acts like she 's on mars or something --
well , she 's back to earth now . they 're all pretty huffed up about your leaving . i think you better go back , kid .
i can see it all now . this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer . you bought forty bucks of fuckin ' film and you never even talked to her .
you tell me , mike . what do i do ?
since you are a friend of my daughter 's , i think i 'm entitled to call you james , do n't you think ?
please do . i was beginning to wonder who this mr. penfield was .
you 're gettin ' in deeper every moment you 're gone .
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident ?
i understand they 've had a bad run of luck , health-wise , and they have my sympathies . but that 's not pg & e 's fault .
you 're kidding , right ? look at these readings for christ 's sake . pg & e 's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells , on numerous occasions .
physically , it 's not a very demanding job . the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh ... the tremendous sense of isolation .
well , that just happens to be exactly what i 'm looking for . i 'm eh ... i 'm outlining a new writing project , and eh ...
... he 's a sorry old guy , but i like him .
he could n't find his ass with both hands .
why does he have a lock on his door ?
because he put the lock on ! do you think i told him he could have a nose ring ? ! why do you ask me everything you should ask him ! ? i do n't know anything , anymore !
do n't tell me , partner . i 'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang .
the way you drove that car , i figured you for the streets .
yeah , i 'll bet ! so , how 's it going with what's-her-name ? dana ?
oh ... pretty well , surprisingly ... you know ...
perhaps it was . i was in boarding school for so many years , it 's hard to remember . do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
yes sir , i do . last night 's , fresh from the park .
on the count of three ! one ... two ...
no ! them ! shoot them ! cross the beams .
i abhor violence . sergeant whitman , i hope you do n't think me mad --
three days too late for that one , `` professor . ''
i 'm getting it back . do n't worry about me , mick . i 'm fine . d'you find the obstetric nurse ?
mary rooney . she wo n't talk to me . i tried her at the hospital . i 'm going to try her back at home . read this .
it would have been so easy to let him in as you went out .
you do n't , you ca n't believe that ...
yes , well at first we thought that was the explanation , but it 's been going on for the past ten days .
you mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
i ca n't ! i ca n't put him in the pot . i ca n't put a live thing in hot water .
gim me ! gim me ! let me do it ! what- what 's he think we 're gon na do , take him to the movies ?
he got it in the belly . he 's still alive , but wo n't be for long .
enough ! you better start talkin ' to us , asshole , cause we got shit we need to talk about . we 're already freaked out , we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin ' bag on our hip .
so hang on . you 're both nadia 's cousins ?
of course not . alexei , he 's is my problem .
well , sounds like me . sorry , man . says you were jealous and suspicious .
says you would sometimes disappear all night , then brag to me about your sexual conquests .
i guess you wo n't mind my keepin ' the bottle .
you 're gon na kill him , ai n't you ?
i thought i might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in connecticut .
you 'd love that , jackie . remember that last summer with mother in the berkshires ? you used to help the gardener .
not unless you could get me into the military academy at anchorhead .
i 'm sorry , sir , i 'm only a 'droid , ' and not very knowledgeable of such things ... not on this system anyway . as a matter of fact , i 'm not even sure which system we 're on .
tone down our headlines ? lacy , that 's all the common man reads !
i 'd just like to have a little less sensationalism .
a lachat , trois ou quatre mille . en location , cinq cent . mais ça pourrait faire plus . je ne sais pas . cest pas vraiment mon truc . i dont know any austrian , xavier .
but maybe you know someone who does . an austrian , in london , dealing in kids and snuff videos . how many can there be ? these people supply to order . he has to be known , reachable .
you and i are the same , darien . we 're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love ... a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .
you 're really twisted , gordon . you 're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there 's a poverty that every last dollar in the world wo n't fill .
oh , man ... this is bullshit ! you ca n't trust anyone these days .
she took everything ! did n't even leave us cab fare .
i 'm tired , hector . i know this because you 're beginning to not bug me .
that < u > sounds < /u > good but underneath it 's hurtful . nightcap ?
do you realize what a thread we 're all hanging by ?
mickey , you 're off the hook . you should be celebrating .
three weeks ago all i thought about was ... well , i did n't actually think about anything . i definitely did n't expect this .
i know . my guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires . 'prison ' came up a few times , but nothing about undead .
haven ? hell , ' we 've been playing poker together since we were fourteen .
i guess that 's why he thought you right want to help out .
all right , it 's plank . is willie there ?
no , i 'm afraid he 's not . he 's out at the moment .
kan maaaaw roy orbison kin nah mah oh che .
... to the tune of `` only the lonely '' by roy orbison .
yeah ? who was he talking to ? acheson ? come on , o'donnell , everyone 's wondering what 's going on . what 's acheson doing in town ? and do n't give me some bullshit about dnc think tanks . acheson 's mr. cold war .
why do n't you ask him yourself ? you can have him on the way home .
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact , but that sand-cat wo n't run at night .
we 'll have to carry the cells ... drag them ... whatever it takes .
where 's mine ? ! where 's my parachute ?
miss teschmacher , superman is a fairly bright individual . my understanding of the way he works is that he wo n't be fooled by a simple trick .
we 've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag . you go get help . i 'm gon na stay here and keep an eye on the bad doctor .
i 'm not going anywhere . we 're a team .
oh , but you must not mind my talking about you ! in fact , william says my main job here at belvoir is to civilize you ; to make an honest english gentleman out of you .
that 's not what i said ! now , sally , you 're embarrassing me ! watch out for her , george ; she talks refinement , but she has a barbarous soul !
what 's the whole thing about -- do you know ?
what i know , you 'll have to find out on your own .
i m not unhappy . frustrated maybe ... discouraged a little . it 'll work out ... .
i 'm worried.. we have n't had our ... .
yes , great ! it 's a beautiful house .
thank you . i understand you 're an interior decorator .
i have to say -- i 'm speechless . no . i 'm never speechless .
i 'm a little embarrassed . i 'm not used to losing control with such -- volume .
we certainly do . vacation 's over - starting right after dinner . but right now - that lady over there - - that 's the new society editor , i take it ? you think i could interrupt her a moment , mr. bernstein ?
huh ? oh , i forgot - you 've been away so long i forgot about your joking -
but , if the farm is not mine , who stole it away ?
no one yet , far as i can tell . it has gone intestate .
business . i need to leave town and i find myself in dire need of some cash .
see that ? that 's just what i 'm talking about .
say , if you 're stringin ' me , old-timer ...
why would i string y ' ? they were sweeties until a month ago .
go away , or i 'll call the police .
why you want to do that , to a frien ' ?
... just got 250,000 shares at 1/4 from janson , think i 'll pull twice that at 1/2 outta the california pensions . we got close to half a million shares in the bag .
hey , the terminator ! blow 'em away ollie .
okay , buddy boy , where ya keepin ' mallory ? i know she 's still here , and i know you know where . so , start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene .
she 's in the holding cell , on this floor .
because it 's true . after thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone , i should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter .
and have you any other truths to tell me ?
and think to yourself -- `` there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home ; there 's no place like home . ''
there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home . there 's no place like home .
first decent idea you 've had in a month .
now i 'll have to wait at least a week . if i announced it tomorrow , after what our new chief nurse saw this afternoon , they 'd hear her yelling from seoul to washington .
from now on , if we 're seen together , it 's got to be accidental . i thought that was understood ...
hey , come on ... we 've got to have at least one victory party .
my father told me that . `` never cry wolf . '' then people wo n't believe you if ... something really happens .
`` if something really happens '' ... like what , james ?
with me , where he 's been after work , three , sometimes four nights a week for the last two months ... we have what you might call an intimate relationship .
how do i know you 're telling the truth ?
here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in havana .
you bet i will . and when i tell him how you treated me , he 'll push your face in . you fink !
so what was that other word for human ... slow ka ?
ss'loka ' . it means literally `` small but intelligent creature '' . it loses much in the translation .
but i 'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge .
i used you as a diversion . while you were getting captured upstairs , i was shredding documents in the basement . deep down , i guess i was just jealous . you were one incredible thief ...
great . i 'll pick you up around eight o'clock . is that good ?
yeah , but do n't pick me up . my father may think it 's strange . i 'll walk over to your house . i 'll be there at eight o'clock .
all right . let 's all go back in . adam ? you 're cool right ?
no . i 'm not boyd . i am not cool at all .
this is getting real old , john . and i 'm tired up to here with it ...
i 'm sorry . i just ... you know ... i ...
so tell me , wyatt . i 'm curious . do you actually consider youself a married man ? forsaking all others ?
well yeah . pretty much . i mean i was no angel when we met but people change doc . i mean sooner or later you got ta grow up .
me ? i 'm loaded with good ! i mean i 've never even used it .
i 'll have to take the chance . try to get them all into that molecule chamber . it takes away their powers , reduces them to human beings . now if you could . . .
if you 've got time before you go `` out , '' get me a half-a-cup of coffee , rose . not a whole cup , a half-a-cup .
why , sure , always got time to get you a half-a-cup , and one of these days i 'm gon na get you a whole cup and see what happens .
of course ! we must do it ! it 's the will of god ! what is it ?
we must ... get you some experience . we must ... leave this place .
simple . i have something you wo n't more than anything . the way to free you from the curse of the treasure . you have something i want -- more than anything .
the pearl ? oh , that 's fine . and just how do you expect this to work ?
rose , really , you should n't act like that .
oh , i know . but i did n't , really . honestly , i did n't . there was only one , but he 's out of town and leave no forwardin ' address .
my lady , this play will end badly . i will tell .
you will not tell . as you love me and as i love you , you will bind my breast and buy me a boy 's wig !
you think she wants us to ease up on the story ?
i do n't know , but i do n't think that 's unreasonable either , do you ?
there you go again . stop saying that . you can make it .
i ca n't . i ca n't . you think you know so much .
are you telling me they ca n't see murders anymore ?
maybe if he 'd taken one of the males . but the female , she 's the key . she 's the one they listen to , the one with the most talent . the one who takes care of the other two .
do n't tease me . you know what i do for a living .
it 's from one of those p.o . boxes . how was the trip ?
there 's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .
i wo n't light the cigars - how about that ?
gray has no need to threaten . you remember the trial ?
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums . it was a famous case .
yes . i am a bit tired , after all .
give me a hand with these , will you , ayegor ?
that 's what you want , is n't it ?
do you mind ? you 're sort of ruining it for me .
do you mind if i sit down ? what about the blue one ?
it is called 'the hawaiian blue ' and there are only seven left . in the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it .
it 's messy ... the thing 's got a gun ... we 're just asking for somebody to get killed ...
we do n't know what else to do . we need results .
no , i 'll get you some tea . wait till you 're in naples . you 'll find a girl there .
just kiss me . it would mean such a lot to me .
what michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand .
but i could understand . i want to understand !
belong - to you ? that sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama ...
so does the history of the world for the past twenty years . i do n't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this , frankly i had hoped that you would , somehow , have known - have taken it for granted that you and i ...
i heared it cryin ' a little through that box .
that do n't seem right . it seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother .
why ca n't the idiot in circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place -- -
because you 're the editor-in-chief . your integrity is unquestioned . lois i have a question .
his stooge , falco , is around - i saw him walk in . he 's been spying on me for weeks , susie .
darling , i do n't care - really i do n't . sidney 'd had a secret crush on me for years , but nothing we do is his business -
hello , heap of dirt . pooh , you do n't wash much do you , judging by the horrible smell .
why do you say that , brother ? i had a shower this morning .
shortstop . 'course , you do n't make it to third , and you 're out .
so let 's say you get there ... what 's uh , third base feel like ?
look , i 'm sorry . they 're assholes ! but we work in a creative business . you ca n't predict what people are gon na like --
the only reason i did taxi was so i could have my own special !
did you give her a jump ? if you did i might begin to understand where your head 's at .
it was n't about getting laid . i just wanted to know what might 've happened if things were different .
buddy , i do n't know if that 's such a good idea .
it 'll be wonderful . we 'll be at peace . in the afterlife , you do n't have to worry about finding work .
with everything that was going on in my life , i just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- i needed time . viktor bought me that time . i owe him so much .
we all do . but now i understand you 're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we 're all expecting .
did you ask daddy to have the hat examined ?
i threw that filthy thing away -- i do n't know what you 're trying to prove with it , but --
why did you do that ? scrape off your hair ?
in my world -- before i left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair .
as i said , it is beyond our comprehension .
as i said , then it 's god , right ?
sure , but is that it for the list ?
that 's five . so . why did you decide to deejay again ?
why ca n't i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you ?
yeah . well -- that 's the way it crumbles , cookie-wise . go to sleep .
did i ever tell you to eat up ? go to bed ? wash your ears ? do your homework ? no . i respected your privacy and i taught you self-reliance .
what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country . and i learned it so well that we 've hardly spoken for twenty years .
if you 're trying to push my buttons , you 're on the right track . do n't make me question my own judgment , x .
buddy , you sent me here to get close to their organization , that costs money .
hey , i heard you went to summer school ?
yeah , chemistry . my father thought i should get ahead .
what do you mean `` he did n't talk ? '' you sat there for an hour ?
no , he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over . it was pretty impressive , actually .
what about you , mare ? how the hell 'd you manage to stay single ?
i do n't know ... my friends think i 'm too picky . i think i 'm just a weirdo magnet . i did come close once -- just last year , in fact . there was this guy he lived in san francisco .
cobb ! get lunch for the rest of them .
what ? there must be of them out there .
they are ... sinister . they want to kill me .
that sounds charming . what are you planning to do tomorrow ?
yes , that 's because i 'm getting to her .
you 're getting to all of us martha , let 's face it .
if you do n't have anyone to tell , you wo n't tell anyone . believe me , you get used to it .
i think you 're too used to it . if you ask me , you 've been doing this job too long .
still got my picture , i see -- i was pretty dumb then , was n't i , chad ?
no -- inexperienced -- a red-headed kid -- homemade clothes -- broadway was paradise -- and a slot at the automat was a banquet .
help me with this one , i 'm really screwed up .
bring it left . bring it left , you 're high .
but maybe i 'm wrong . maybe you 're wrong . maybe we 're both crazy .
in a few weeks , it will have started or it wo n't . if there are still baseball games and traffic jams , armed robberies and boring tv shows -- we 'll be so happy , we 'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police .
they think we 're carrying cuban refugees . skipper , they mean to board us .
not a chance . remind them that according to the geneva convention , firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war .
i < u > am < /u > serious , and do n't call me shirley ! what flying experience have you had ?
well , i flew single-engine fighters in the air force , but this plane has four engines . it 's an entirely different kind of flying ... < u > all < /u > < u > together < /u > ! ! !
i want to `` make love '' to him .
i 'm going to tell him you said that .
do n't you love it when old friends stop by ?
hey , i 'm starved ... let 's go get something to eat . we 'll bring back food for everybody .
-- it was all in hundreds , was n't it ?
a lot of it was . i just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund -- you know , for taking fat cats to dinner , things like that .
good evening . did you have a pleasant day today ?
busy . i went swimming and prepared a new vehicle . a big vehicle .
but , please , steve , please - one step at a time ! i was born only yesterday ! ...
i told your brother i could n't be his accomplice . i ca n't be yours either , susie , and encourage him to go on pulverizing you . i know what type - he 's my old man all over again !
you got to be more careful . hands is important . let me show you something . when i was a kid , now i do n't know if you can still see it , but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower .
i 'm very interested in this but is there someplace ...

who 'd have thought it ? danny `` chickenshit '' flynne trying to go large right under our noses .
lay off , garcetti . i 'm not in the mood .
she 's nosy . she hears me on the telephone .
anyway , i do n't think we 'll ever see them again . everything 's back to normal .
if you were going to come back you would n't have taken me out tonight . you would n't have bought this dress . you 're hustling me , eddie . you 've never stopped hustling me .
now , i never hustled you . even when i thought i was . you know it .

our families , fred . i 've always looked on bessie as my own sister .
how wagnerian ... do you mean to say you 've waited all these years because you could n't create a chip on your own ? that would have amused peter .
speaking of peter , there 's more good news : you wo n't even have to change your last name . you 'll always be mrs. peel .
right . the worm guy . can someone get those people off the beach ?
excuse me , would you mind telling me what the hell i 'm doing here ?

i 'm not avoiding you . i 've been very busy and . . . i like you . . . i really do .
and my class . it 'll be hard to find a good substitute . and what about my math program ?
paul said he 'd call the school . and your father thinks he 's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help .
well , if it is n't mr. interpol himself . i ca n't believe i misjudged you like i did .
oh please..you 're on some sort of holy mission ?
yeah , but if i told her about the other stuff about frank ...
are you embarrassed by these things that you see ?
i interviewed him after i met you . i 'm his social secretary now . well , assistant to his secretary .
i commend you . if you 're going to pursue poofs , go after those who can do favors for you . you waste everybody 's time when you court dinosaurs .
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye ? when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky ? when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting ? when will the heart be aweary of beating , and nature die ?

one cervical stabilizer , two sets of dilators -- douglas points . one medium- sized curette , one small ; one medium speculum , one large ; two vulsellum forceps .

we ca n't < u > afford < /u > a war .
judge wakefield , it 's an honor to handle it for you . consider it gone away . she 's a minor ; it probably would 've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway .
still , this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally .
i wan na go double or nothing on the next game .
double or nothing ? are you fucking out of your mind ?
this is reilly deifenbach at gmac . sir , i have not yet received those vehicle ids you promised me .
yah ! i ... those are in the mail .
i 'm used to spending a lot of time alone . i guess that 's what i thought it would be out here . but , it 's not is it ?
i 'm sorry i left you hanging up there .
did you hate him ? had you ever thought of doing something like this before ?
was theft involved ? did you catch him trying to steal something , or find he had stolen something ?
what makes you so high and mighty ? did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror . you do n't get eyes like that from ...
he 's worse than an animal . jail 's too good for scum like that .
i hope you do n't think i owe you anything . because i do n't owe you a damn thing .

buddy , you sent me here to get close to their organization , that costs money .
one point two million dollars ? i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars !
or this afternoon . it 's a good day for it .
benjamin -- i have n't even said i 'll marry you yet .
why ? you 've got more force of will than anyone i 've ever seen . you handle a gun like it 's a part of you , you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia ... and most amazing of all , you quit smoking , just like that .
the mark of a true samurai . what i do for the company , vincent , is no different than what you do . we 're both hired guns , and this is a job -- like any other job .
it 's strange how anxious women are to display themselves . it 's almost a natural inclination .
but how could they pose like that ? i could n't .
that may be . but dad stays where < u > he < /u > is , and i 'm staying here !
you 're really a mixed-up oddball , are n't you ?
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment .
and your arrest . you 'll each get about ten years , i think .
there 's an ordinance against burning anything in this town , unless it 's ...
we 'll use smoke pots . like the army uses .
i know who you are mr. donovan . your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous . some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive .
well , like yourself , doctor jones , i have a passion for antiquities . have a look over here . this might interest you .
listen , dick . killing two-face wo n't take the pain away . it 'll make it worse .
look , spare me the sermons , okay . you 're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed . you do n't even know me .
do n't worry , james , i 'll figure something out .
i 'm not worried . you 're not worried , are you . professor tripp ?
stop it , doyle ! do n't talk about daddy , you hear me !
do n't talk about daddy . y'all go on to the garage and let me be .
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away .
i do n't care what , ai n't nobody just gon na let us walk away with a ship that size .
there 's another wire from peter , sir . they 're in glen falls , michigan .
`` what 's holding up the annulment , you slow poke ? the walls of jericho are toppling . '' send him a telegram right away . just say : `` let 'em topple . ''
worse . mrs. argon wants to talk to you . she 's waiting in the lab .
this day just keeps going from bad to worse .
yes , of course , uriah . i feel his evil presence .
no , he lost the house after the stock market crash .
oh now , you put up a good fight . let 's change the subject . where do people who live in oasisburg go to get away from it all ?
somewhere very far away , very quiet , and very ... this is all wonderful , selina , but ... but i 'm afraid i can not rest until all my sister 's killers are brought to justice ... that one-armed monster..
who 's the new side of beef in tran 's posse ?
guy named wade beemer . used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97 .

burn the passport and keep the money . think of it as a donation to the cause ...
what ? is she having some secret affair with josh ?
i have no idea - i just want to ...
you ca n't see past your lousy little assignment , sniffing around the pipeline . the few voters there are in this district look up to corbett , and i 'm not about to alienate them .
i should release corbett because you want some votes ?
okay , maybe that 's a < u > good < /u > thing . maybe i can use him to help with --
he also figured out how to kill the pilot , fry .
you 're new to charenton , yes ? perhaps you 're not yet familiar with my husband , and his unusual case .
with all due respect , madame , all france is familiar with your husband . grant us a moment alone , wo n't you , monsieur prouix ?

we have to have a long talk about all this .
i know just the place . hang a left at the amalgamated tower .
only myself and two other girls . one is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor .
just three people in a room this size ? whew !
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me .
i 'm sorry miss weathers . allow me to introduce myself , mark kincaid , l.a.p.d . are you familiar with the actor ben damon , or the actress christine perkins ?
some of these are so old and tattered . you should throw them away .
i have . or there would be twice as many .
do you know how close i was to getting some trim . and you fucked ' it up .
yeah , well , my ass bleeds for you . and i did n't get you out so you could go on a goddamn `` trim '' hunt ... stop moaning .
um ... i ... i did not ... no . why ?
sarah has gone missing ... my servant girl . her things are gone . damn it . she has joined the migration out of town . what about breakfast , woman ? or , am i to starve to death ?
captain sparrow ! we have to get off this island -- immediately !
do n't be thinking i 'm not already working on it .
and i would n't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful . at a tactic that insults their intelligence .
that 's curious . i was < u > appealing < /u > to their intelligence .
i do n't know what you mean , sir .
well , there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will . these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study .
you bet . and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off , he coulda left this line behind on carl 's boat .
and replaced it later with the new one . that 's your inference ?
but , missus , this is an emergency . it 's a matter of life and death . me friend 's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death .
i ... i 'm very sorry , but i never open . i 'm very sorry but i never open the door to strangers after dark .
yeah , i 'm sorry , but that 's the way it is .
it 's all right . i 'll forward your mail .
she threw a punch at a man on the team .
well , you know , that happens , on the street .
it sure is . now eat it up . you 're gon na need your energy .
i got energy up the ying-ying . let 's get cracking !
what do you think you were in your previous life , amy ?
oh , i do n't know . maybe i was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
you could n't . you 've never been out there , you said .
no , i have n't . i guess i thought the name was familiar . by the way , you discussed with senator paine where the camp was to be situated and everything ?
and you still maintain your ship did not fire on kronos one ? would you have known if she had ? come now , captain . the record clearly there were no other ships in the sector .
there ... were no other ships in the sector .
yeah i know . patchett 's running whores and judging by his address , probably something bigger on the side . he does n't want any attention .
that 's right . our motives are selfish , so we 're cooperating .
got me off the streets ? i live on 59th and park .
whatever . you are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and i mean never to see my daughter again . is that understood ? !
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
these are my children . mine . and they ai n't no question . none .
you should stickaround sometimes . look out for me .
look , frances , i 'm only gon na ask this one time . i mean it . i swear after this , i 'll never ask again : will you marry me ?
so . we 're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the spec-recon training . it may not always be smooth , but we 're trying to make it as painless as possible for you .
thank you , sir . but i expect a certain amount of pain .
i 'm pretty busy , as you can see ...
that 's no excuse . you read the script , did n't you ?
hello , ferrari . how 's business at the blue parrot ?
fine , but i would like to buy your cafe .
i 'm all tied up . i ca n't .
could n't we work in the evenings ? six o'clock in the morning ? this next month i 'm completely at your disposal . artie is out of town .
hey , i hope you did n't take that stuff i said seriously . it was just part of the show ! it 's like the old days , when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd .
oh . so you were just pretending to be an asshole .
i just wonder what could be more important than what 's going on with dad .
if we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier . you know , your room is always ready for you , you can always come home if ... alright , what do you want me to do ?
what do i do with it hawk ? this is a little out of my line .
did n't recognize you , red . when you get the clamp all the way down , open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery .
and i ca n't guarantee the end will be quick .
elvis is fuckin ' dead , man . get yourself some cds .
all i need is the radio frequency to track them .
what are you talking about ? i 'm coming with you .
can you use a few bucks ? i ai n't got much , but --
no , man , i 'm doing okay . thanks .
the adm ! be careful , andy . it 's very powerful . how do you know about it ?
i went to st. severin church . now look -
hold on there - i do n't want this pomade , i want dapper dan .
i do n't carry dapper dan . i carry fop .
i 'd quit the army for you , if it came to that .
man 's gon na retire in two years and he offer to quit . big goddamn deal .
i do n't understand , jeanne ... why did you do it ? why ?
and you ? why did you lie ? you promised i could be confessed ...
yes ! yes ! the boy ! one boy !
and what , exactly , is your relationship to mrs. ryan ?
my date 's a flute-toting band dork . that answer your question ?
oz , how about you and heather ? now you guys are a couple or something ?
right , sure , but what 's the problem ? are they keeping you a prisoner here ? do they drug you ? did reverend mother like , kidnap your parents ? we can call the enquirer .
no , you do n't understand -- i do n't want to get out ! i want to get in ?
... i 've seen things . in there . last night . you did too . do n't tell me you did n't . you were crying like a baby .
you said the vision , the images . they 're just that . just pictures . they ca n't hurt you . that 's what you always said .
that 's not the issue , delmar . even if it did put you square with the lord , the state of mississippi is more hardnosed .
you should a joined us , everett . it could n't a hurt none .
jews can no longer own businesses , sir , that 's why this one 's for sale .
well , they would n't own it , i 'd own it . i 'd pay them back in product . they can trade it on the black market , do whatever they want , everybody 's happy .
somebody told me nathan was back . how is he ?
why do n't you pay him a visit , mr. howard ? he 'll tell you all about it .
i gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they ?
shredded . sorry . decided to whip up one of my own : a group so hungry for money that they 'd be willing to do anything . i thought you 'd be more comfortable with your peers .
it was my idea , grandma . i always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings .
he wo n't tell me , but i 've got my suspicions . and i do n't want any of that . do n't keep her out late .
i'11 take my chances , thank you . it 's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop .
where are you going to go , verbal ? you gon na run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know they 'll get you out there .
and why was that ? did it have some particular value or power ?
no , it 's just ... a sword is a weapon .
servants . oh is n't it terrible darling , two more people have disappeared
oh really ? we 're they `us'es ' or `them 's ' ?
no , he 's out changin ' the oil in the car .
man , i got ta take a piss bad ... can i use your head there ?
yah , linda 's fine . you should call her .
geez . well - geez . that 's a suprise .
does she sound pissed , scared , hostile ? did she mention the police ?
no , but she 's definitely pissed and hostile . and she 's clearly starting to think that 's something 's not right .
-- that ca n't happen . earl does n't want him to have the money , the things .
-- unless frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that 's what will happen .
there 's no way we 're gon na hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here . besides , it 'll be safer where it is .
with all due respect , skipper . part of that up there 's mine . i 'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it .
could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?
i felt limited . i felt confined . i felt like i was suffocating .
too bad you and i are the only ones .
i 'm still ca n't believe you did n't tell donovan the alibi .
you did fine . do n't sweat her . we 're meeting our honeys soon . you know christy 's friend is going to be money .
i hope so . we got ta go soon .

ipo 's caused the rat population on this street .
i like to sail , believe me , i love to sail ! instead i make boats and other people sail them .
stop ! it 's too much ! you 're making all the hairs on my neck stand up !
you think bad , and bad is what you get .
that 's a good piece of advice , darrell .
it 's got to be here . i heard him talk about it . he bragged about it . six steps out , three left .
this is good . this is real good . this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us . they 'll probably just lock us up for being idiots .
bud ! where you been the last two days ?
... janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps , urgent ...
`` james '' ! nobody ever calls me that .
have you been a patient at county ? have i seen you someplace ?
yeah , he was picked up -- also the body from the morgue . say , what did you have to do with stealing that body ?
why , buckley stole that body . that 's what alarmed mrs. buckley so . i have been try- ing to get her to put buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him .
i do n't deal black-jack clips ! it 's policy . i got ethics here .
yeah , when did that start ? come on , man ! it 's what people want to see , and you know it .
that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earth 's sun .

you ca n't go back to find your home . your home is in your heart , in the future that you make for yourself .
and this is my future . this is who i am !
that 's it -- syndrome . so you know all about it ?
no ... a little . there 's a lot of debate about it .
perhaps i could drop round for tea or something ?
yeh -- unfortunately , things are going to be pretty busy , but ... okay , let 's give it a try . four o'clock could be good .
this man gordon liddy -- he 's going to be tried along with hunt and the five burglars -- we know he knows a lot , we just do n't know what .
you changed cabs ? you 're sure no one followed you ?
well , i ... good point . what do you suggest ?
let me try to get to her . i 'll deactivate her .
no , maggie , i defended you . humiliating you is what everyone else is doing . it 's the theme of this party .
i had it under control . now they feel sorry for me .
we keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering .
so i 'll be the first one to go in then ?
tommy , come on . put the gun away .
no . it 's okay . just watch this . watch it .
gordo plays the inside . you 're the shill .
yeah , but come on ... all i get to do is cry and get insulted .
maybe they 're all protecting the species . maybe they 're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and ...
are you discussing gamebirds now ? all birds are not gamebirds , you know .
why did n't you tell us ? why did n't you tell us ?
i 'm sorry . please , carla . i did n't think there was any danger . i 'm sorry . i love you . both of you .
where is he ? ? he was supposed to meet me .

oh , yes , there 've been a lot of them around here already . strangest kind of people . salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something . i have n't had a minute to myself . have n't seen grant 's tomb yet .
well , you see , your uncle did n't bother with that sort of thing . he left everything to us . he traveled most of the time , and enjoyed himself . you should do the same thing , mr. deeds .
but ... i do n't remember anything , i swear ...
i leave these open . maybe something comes back to you .

o , let us hence ; i stand on sudden haste .
wisely and slow ; they stumble that run fast .
you 're kidding . ca n't you shoot him or something ?

oh , that 's taken care of . i called the state attorney 's office . you were no-filed this morning in circuit court .
you were gon na run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks .
nothing so far from arrests , hospital admissions or coroners . this kind of search ... it 's heavy spadework . i 'm gon na need --

baby , i finally got you alone in this jacuzzi and i do n't wan na be discussin ' hair care .

hell they do n't . i met my first wife that way .
it 's peggy to these eyes . same nose , same hair . plus buckaroo thinks so too or else he would n't be ready to go make a fool of himself , right ?
i 'll admit it 's confusing from the outside . you 've got to see it from the inside .
if you see anything from the inside it makes sense . you ought to hear perverts talk . a guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me .
you do n't think she 'd be raped if she were captured ? you do n't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men ?
you broke a dozen training rules back there -- before i lost count .

do n't give me that . i know what 's real , goddamnit ! you strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer .
why the hell are we delivering them out here ? i ca n't even find any warrants in the system for these four .

so could you . but our records were a little against us .
no i just ... .i do n't want to , i just want to be connected to talk to a girl .
it 's a call back service -- a girl will call you back .
you shoulda stuck around , jerk . ms. fleming wants to redefine the high school experience .
she wants to ignore the high school experience . our way 's better . we scare people into not being assholes .
that 's right -- we ca n't kill it on the ship , but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock .
thing is , i 'm about out of fuel .

definitely . 'you may show the dent at the top of the artist 's buttocks -- but neither cheek . in the event of a stunt person being used , the artist must have full consultation . '
no plan is perfect , lenny . hey , cheer up . world 's gon na end in ten minutes anyway .
you must be so pleased , i followed your jellybean trail right here , like a good little chump .

a black man playing big league ball is something .
if you 're worried about the president , call and warn him about the space shuttle .

that 's the way i 've always wanted it to be , elaine .
but it wo n't be . not as long as you insist on living in the past !
you must n't mind margo too much , even if i do ...
but there must be some reason , something i 've done without knowing ...
there 's no time . there are civilians in there . it 's about to go down .

you suspected all along , suspected he was alive . that 's why you came to el paso .

i 'll hold this , if you do n't mind . you can have it back when you leave .
you dump her and i 'll give you cash .
what 's debbie 's blue book value right now ?
maybe it 's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message . burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe . it could be to humiliate them . just burning them up , no proper funeral , it 's like condemning them to hell .
eastern europe . like what ? romania ? hungary ?
excuse me , counselor wendy , i need assistance in finding that important ... thingie in the storage room .
oh my gosh , why did n't you say something earlier ...
you 're all right , charlie . i 'm glad you stopped by . i 'm sorry if  well i know i sometimes run on .
hell no ! jesus , i 'm the kind of guy , i 'll let you know if i 'm bored . i find it all pretty damned interesting . i 'm the kind schmoe who 's generally interested in the other guy 's point of view .
you mean , it would be too tough to give me a turndown here . easier on home grounds .

i 'd come to the realization that everything i 'd based my life on was false . and that my life had no meaning .
he gets this way when he hits over eighty-five .
he 's going to south america to marry some other girl - that 's what they call high finance .

nossir . i 'd gone to tell the wid ... to tell mrs. heine .
dammit , beavis , i was about to score . huh huh .
yeah , but check it out . it 's gone !
his paws are frozen and he can not walk .
when you eat him , may i have some ?
well , it 's a surprise all right , a bit bewildering too .
we 've only just read about it in the morning papers .
shit , i wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em .
just in the wrong place at the wrong time .
you remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up ?
yeah , pooh-bear . dude is a big-time cook . i 'm talking dire .

if you believe this is murder , it is the crown attorney you have to talk to , not me . and definitely not agnes .
well , you know doc , when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind ... say like is someone burns toast .
well , maybe things that happened ... leave other kinds of traces behind .
oswald was an assassin . you 're not an assassin , are you , jerry ?
if you 're worried about the president , call and warn him about the space shuttle .

what 're you gon na do , rachel ? you gon na sit in a bar in baltimore ? you want your job back ? you want a life ?
i do n't < u > have < /u > a life , bobby . i 'm in love with a married man .
we 'd ... i do n't know ... go to california , new york , maybe a house on a swiss mountainside ...
it 'd have to be switzerland to make sure dwayne never finds us .
if that 's a potential you see yourself fulfilling ... i mean ... my , i sound a bit --
i 'm sorry . that was stupid of me . i did n't mean to be so rude .
talk away , lady of my dreams . i 'm all ears .
this is private , auggie . just between you and i .

let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go .
now that 's pretty important , dean . you also told the fbi when you met him , he was six foot two . then you tell the commission he was five foot eight . how the hell did the man shrink like that , dean ?
they put the heat on , my man , just like you 're doing . i gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza . truth is , i never met the dude .
what the fuck do you think you 're doin ' ? give me my book back !
i 'm sick of fuckin ' hearin ' it joe ; i 'll give it back when we leave .

you really want me to put all this stuff back on ?
yes . i think so . show some pride , hamilton .
oh please -- just till i get sleepy . then you can force me right back to my room .
well.. i suppose it would be all right , for just a little while .
< u > stensland and buzz meeks < /u > . two-man triggers knocking off mickey cohen lieutenants . when they killed deuce perkins , they got heroin as a bonus .
then something goes wrong . meeks gets killed . maybe stens got greedy , killed meeks and left him under his girlfriend 's house . the night he died , stens was all mysterious . said he had something big going down .
we 'll kill you , man -- we got ta gun .
pull heat on me ? -- i 'll dent ya face !
he 's right . they must have clobbered some of our cities already .
the dirty , stinking , rotten , sons of b 's ! ! they might have clobbered marge and the
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but do n't say much .
do n't judge a comic book by it 's cover .
and herbert exchange a glance . honora smiles at juliet .
i 've heard your mother on 3ya . the woman 's session has lots of lively debate .
so baby do n't cry like there 's no tomorrow after the night there 's a brand new day . and there 'll be no pain and no more sorrow . so wash your face and phone my place it 'll be o.k .
i wanted to be loved completely . my body throbbed excitedly . oh brad , brad my darling , how could i have done this to you ?
to speak to just a playwright 's wife ? i 'm the lowest form of celebrity ...
you 're margo channing 's best friend . you and your husband are always with her - and mr. sampson ... what 's he like ?
yes . he went to mount vernon to give himself a patriotic address .
well -- that 's very fine . saunders , some person in your office says you 've quit --
kim 's prints were all over it -- he admitted it was his gun , f'r godsake !
your honor , the witness ' response was non-responsive ... i ask you to strike it from the record ... !
i have enough flaxedil with me to put him out . and i think i know a way to --
< u > forget < /u > < u > it < /u > .
we have all of this without you . you can not bargain with what you do n't have .
oh magnificent one . what i am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son of jor-el .
what the fuck did you do to my trunk ?
well , that key 's not gon na work . i had to pop the lock . you did n't leave me the trunk key .
it 's just that i 'm very worried about madame .
sure you are . and we 're not help- ing her any , feeding her lies and more lies . getting herself ready for a pioture ... what happens when she finds out ?
shall we say dinner on friday . just the two of us ? you can come too if you like , schwartz .
that 's sounds fine , sir . got ta run .
ehh ... i 'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you 're the best jag people in town ... so uhm .
well enrique is great and ... we are the best .
maybe you can do it and maybe you ca n't , mr. kane .
charles ! your - your breaking this man 's neck - would scarcely explain this note - serious consequences for mr. kane - for myself , and for my son . what does this note mean , miss -
i did n't understand the spot i was putting roderick in .
and that was the last time you saw him ?
yeah ... you were a lot of help with those guns . your soldier shit is bad- ass .
i 'd hoped i was finished with all that . but ...
listen buddy ! cut the crap ! we 're looking for ann , not making a goddamn movie !
jack ... you get to save the girl and i get my third act ! it 's gon na be good for you and good for me !
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video ?
if spielburg can direct `` the color purple '' and `` amistad '' , our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot .
how would you go about applying the golden rule , earl ?
i 'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only . there 's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we 'd use some sense .
and so , in a blazing fury , charles runs lancelot trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving deborah free to accept charles 's proposal of marriage !

i 'm really beat . i need some serious `` z 's '' --
the pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball . and if you discover before a game you 're in the wrong nostril , it 's easy to switch .
you call this ... glory ... ? all this ... this blood ... this smell of ...
... the smell of victory , jeanne ! mmmmmmm ! i love it !
no , no ! i have n't heard any of this . i never got those telephone calls . i 've never been in this house ... get your things together . let 's get out of here .
all my things ? all the eighteen suits , all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts , and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains , and the cigarette cases ?
buff , sit . you know what i mean though ? somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat .
yeah , well , he 's from a third world country . he does n't have it easy .
well , i think windows stink . what do you think of that ?
... i guess it 's ... just a matter of personal taste .
will you still be working at yarn barn ? 'cause that 's a great place to raise children .
no , a year of partying is enough . she 'll be going to harvard this fall .
we have no choice , general calrissian . our cruisers ca n't repel firepower of that magnitude .
han will have that shield down . we 've got to give him more time .
i can not take comfort when she has none .
then give me comfort . sleep with me tonight .
charlie , twenty-eight bucks is nothing . the only way to do it is through your uncle ... think about it will you ?
no ! ! ! what do you think i am , crazy ? ? ?
if we have to see the porter we 'd better go .
what 's the hurry ? ca n't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes ?
i ca n't believe i let him stay in my house . right under my nose . that deviant fucker was right under my nose and i did n't see him .
if he had been under your prick you 'd have spotted him for sure .
why do you bring this up after so many years ?
they are here ! ... your jewels ! ... here in paris !
well , i say lets tear this place apart for weapons . so when they burst through that door , we 'll make 'em wish they never did .
i do n't give a shit about living or dying anymore . i just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as i can .
are n't they gon na wonder were you 've been ?
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they 'll believe me . i 've been lying for so long , one more time wo n't hurt .
i swear to god i had nothing to do with it ...
bullshit ... i do n't walk to talk to you ...
those arabs wo n't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes .
johnny ! why did n't you tell me before ?
sorry . you look great . i 'm totally exhausted .
good . total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous . let 's play catch .
... you got your doctor 's testimony . why do you need me ?
i want someone who was in the o.r . we 're going to win the case , there 's no question of that . it 's just a matter of how big ...
it is not enough to be witty , madame . people grow tired of being entertained . you made that mistake before . problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony .
my dear , you do n't know how impressive i could be . did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels ?
oh , great , listen , baby , i got ta get back , okay ?
okay , but how did it go at the bank ?
d.w.p . thanks for holding . how can i help you ?
i got a message . i live at locklin .
well , we do have data from honeycutt 's sources , chief - but it is n't pertinent .
i 'd like to hear that data , kaufman .
lillian ... i 'm more than willing to meet you halfway .
do n't make me sick . i 'd sooner drown myself in puget sound .
i am not a seaman . but i heard it is no more than a week at sea . i hope you are not too disappointed .
how could i be ? the mainland has been found . exactly as i said it would .
oh . so what did you do after you gave up on acting ?
well , i went to law school , if you can believe that .
it 's happening . is n't that a good enough reason ?
i like bodega bay as well as any man . if i thought ...
thelma , i 've lost my wife , i 'm not losing my child .
all right ... okay ... but let 's get something straight , right now . i mean , i 'm sorry about what happened between you and joanna , but it 's not my problem , understand ?
boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you .
that 's ridiculous , so , if you really ca n't stand someone , then you pretend that you 're really crazy about them ?
that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them .
sorry . i thought i was doing quite well .
i hate to be pragmatic , but they 'll sacrifice pawns before kings . it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff .
okay . also , i want you to put our bases in turkey on alert , and have the kitty hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike .
kurtz , you 're drunk . who 's in command of this ship ?
that damn computer has taken over . i 'm getting out .
one rule ! no throwing up . he throws up , you forfeit everything .
you ever see mah boy throw up ? shut your mouth and put up your money !
a tape from the surveillance camera at the first national bank . it was robbed this morning .
really ? i want to make sure that i understand what you 're telling me , greley . a crime was committed in new york city ? that is news .
< i > this is a thing called a present . the whole thing starts with a box ... < /i >
< i > -- a box ? -- is it steel ? -- are there locks ? -- is it filled with a pox ? -- a pox ! -- how delightful , a pox ! < /i >
it 'll be close -- but there 's still a margin of safety .
let 's find what the devil 's holding them up ! contact the proteus !
i was trying to get her up wind ! that 's what you do when you 're hit a-beam . or maybe you 're too stupid to know that !
that 's not what skipper thought . he was trying to spill air from the main !
you just said you 're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking .
shit . c'mon , get up here and help me out .
get her out of circulation - i 've put her on the detention list .
you mean you 're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department ?
and instead , i came -- bringing you nothing .
instead -- you come , with sympathy , betsy , and a generous heart . do n't forget that . do n't call it nothing .
i know he messed up , but that does n't change what he 's been to you .
what has he been to me ? i mean , he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing . like it was easy . and i 'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she 's the one with no sense ...
oh , i 'm not squawkin ' , but i 'm not used to working and it 's a bad habit to get into .
it 'll never hurt you -- -got any money ?
the old man ? he 's gon na tell you who killed leo ?
go catch jimmy , ray . really . he 's gettin ' away . go ahead , go get him . i 'm late .

we 're in there . we 're in there --
forever . we used to live on the same island in greece , when we were kids .
what was he like , when he was little ?
just look at you ! dust and filth from top to toe !
want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good ?
fifty grand gouge . south shore hayseeds , this is why i never play tahoe , or redneck reno ...
we 're hot , and they 're losing a whole floor 's worth of business saying it 's `` under construction . ''
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca .
that is also true , except for one destination , to return to occupied france .
i spoke to betty sizemore yesterday . that 's right . there 's no doubt in my mind , folks ... she 's on the run . whether or not she 's mixed up in all this remains to be seen ...
that 's bullshit , sheriff ! you think she 's a suspect !
who is they ? is frank part of some larger group ?
i do n't know . gretchen has a theory . that frank is a sign . i told her i thought it was ridiculous .
you 're not gon na make some deal with that guy , are you ? i mean , i just wan na know .
no , thelma . i 'm not gon na make any deals .
the style of the letters i 'm getting matches those found at the crime sites . why would the riddler be sending me riddles ? who 's your decorator ? u-haul ?
sorry . i have n't even had time to unpack . instant coffee okay ?
have ya been to the celebrity room before ? with other , uh , clients ?
i do n't think so . it 's nice .
we did our utmost to have it set ahead .
i know , gentlemen , but it is in the hands of the court . we 're helpless , are n't we ?
that 's curious . i was < u > appealing < /u > to their intelligence .
< u > were < /u > you , sir ? can you < u > prove < /u > one word of all your fancy story ?
sweetheart , you know we ca n't go home , there might be a war .
geoffrey , you do so love putting on a disguise .
jack , just make yourself at home . would you like some coffee ?
well , if you are going to have some , i would n't mind . thanks .
disillusioned ... but vindicated ! i 've been right all along . you ca n't trust the older generation . it 's a matter of values --
all right , all right . will you do me a favor ? no orders .
she sued you for back payments of child support ?
she did not sue me . we had a dispute over money ... i settled it , she dropped the complaint ... any other questions ?
thorstenson gieselensen . he just separated from his third . he 's in fish . he is fish .
she 's keeping his name . and one of his planes . and all seven of his children
if she comes over here , max , my brain is going to turn into guacamole .
i 'll handle it . i 'll handle it . hi .
according to the guinness book , you passed the world 's record several whacks ago .
i did ? ! i broke the world 's record .
sylvia -- sweetie -- it 's not that -- but i promised the guy i 'd be out of here by eight o'clock , positively .
what guy ? whose apartment is this , anyway ?
where 's the fucking recharger cord ? must be in her car , dammit .

no more favors . that 's all over , sonny .
aw , jesus ... you been doin ' us favors all night !
luke trumbo ? we never met . but i 'd like to think i know him .
is that because you were masquerading as luke trumbo while you were in lawson ?
hell , i could n't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me !
she 's not all that homely , mister mcmurphy . in fact , she must have been a rather beautiful young lady .
what 's your problem ? i 'm doing the job .
what 's my problem ? you want a list ?
you know i get calls from back home every fuckin ' day ? ! they think you went batshit !
i 'm only on tv because i got ta be able to hang around the casino . you understand that . you know that . come on .
i do n't know what has happened to prince joseph .
what cowardice ! what treason ! joseph has ruined everything . how could they all lose their heads . they knew i was coming up fast . victory was just within grasp . come , come , turn your troops around , general belliard .
martin , ca n't you just deal with this yourself ?
but it 's not for the shop . it 's for you .
i will only be gone about half an hour .
if you leave before the work is done , you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good .
uh-huh . is he the best then , for , uh ...

not bad . briliiant , actually . you come unarmed , and alone . cause your army 's been growing underground for what ? years ? ?
give or take . it was right around your civil war , i think , when i was here last . we were waiting till your planet was warm enough .
josie you owe it to yourself to go . for your writing . you 're a natural .
thanks . wow . that 's -- really nice to hear .
how about a pedicure as long as you 're down there . what 's this ? lo-jack ?
wherever you go on the planet , i 'll find you . there 's no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
what 're you talking about ? we have that .
helen 's phone . her office line and the line at my house .
i can only speculate as to the reasons why .
have you ever speculated , mister harding , that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements ?
eighty-six so far . all cranks . he smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces . none of them knew that ;
what else did you keep out of the papers ?
... she went in complaining of stomach cramps . good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart .
is that what a good doctor would do ? how old are you , please ?
so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day .
you think so ? joyce says she 's timid .
i 'm standing most of my day . they 're for support . did n't see you in church this mornin ' .
been on the crop . may need to get some extra hands if i do n't want to work on sundays .
the night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me , to help me -- i turned you away .
do n't , paul -- do n't doubt yourself -- do n't make me doubt you .
not sure . some sort of vacation . i 'll let you know where i 'm going .
oh , you do n't have to do that . would n't be a vacation if you did .
i said say that again , son - because the next time you do , i 'll make sure you 're in there with my daughter , but in a slightly less healthy state and she 's in a coma with a broken arm right now .
i 'm er ... sorry if you 've been waiting a long time .
do n't talk like that . your mama loves you .
i had another dream last night . the dead man laying on top of me and i had nothing to eat . and the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
who 's going to slow me down ? you , you fat pig .
alright , get in the car before i have to embarrass you in front of your friend .
talk ... we should send down an assault team and take them by force .
that is not an acceptable option . if people get hurt , all the support we have in the federation ...
there must be some connection between the plane and this place . they must have deliberately brought us here . why , bob ? what reason could they have for doing a thing like that ?
that 's what 's on the other side of the hill .
gee , you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you .
no , bruce , you did n't come between us . it was all over for her before you came on the scene . for me -- it 'll never be over .
oh i know that . how does it go ...
you know , darling you ... you send me ... darling you ... you mend me . honey , sing it for judge tower .
take yourself . you 've slept with several women . are you happier because of it ?
how do you know i 've been with several women ?
darling , if we 're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open !
now , darling , soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you .
daddy , that 's luke , can you let him in ? i 'll be right down .
honey , i ... i ca n't ... it 's the ...
you 've got to trust me . it sounds silly but i know we were meant to meet .
you mean you were meant to hijack my truck , make me crash it , and have every security man in town looking for me ?
caught me trying to be fancy ! yeah , that 's it , bart .
well , that 's a good question . strange as it may seem , charlie , i guess i write about people like you . the average working stiff . the common man .
a little more tact ... look how nicely she 's fixed the table -- all for us .
how nicely you 've fixed the table , ninotchka .
guys like me , huh . well , listen , even though i 've been celibate lately , i 'm not gon na force myself on you . i 've never done that in my life .
you would n't have time anyway . we come to a roadblock , they 'll run the car , find out in five seconds who it belongs to .
it sounds like `` ex infera : '' `` ex , '' from ; `` infera , '' the ablative case of `` inferi . '' `` hell . ''
`` save yourself . from hell . '' what are you saying , are you saying that this ship is possessed ?
in that case , maybe heyworth got fellated by a brunette and brooke caught him .
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take ?
... did i say rude ? people can be goddamn cruel . especially some of their housewives . okay , so i 've got a weight problem . that 's my cross to bear . i dunno ...
well it 's ... it 's a defense mechanism .
this is me , mike . there 's nothing else ...
you do n't wash your clothes at the boulevard laundromat ... you do n't pick up your kids from some crummy public school ... what is this ? a fuckin ' joke ?
hawk , you 're a great thief . got set up , did some time , nothing to be ashamed of . do n't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down , open a hardware store and sell spatulas ...
if the mario brothers were n't jersey 's third largest family , i 'd say kiss my ass . but considering your status , i 'll say slurp my butt .
well , i 'm trying to educate him ! it 's nothing personal .
adam , i think for you , we should go for `` sweet . ''
so how was your first and last day of branding ?
do n't be so sure it 's my last . there are a few people back home i 'd like to put under a red hot iron .
you said it was just you and your son .
i meant me , my son and my daughter .
now , lydia ... favor us about your ghosts .
< u > no < /u > ! do not encourage this little ... person .
c'mon , thel . so charley had a little fling . so what ? all in all he was a pretty good husband .
look , i know this is n't gon na make any sense , okay ? i mean forget the logic part ... but i keep thinking if charley really loved me , he would n't have let me divorce him .
i 'll fuckin ' give it to him ! we 'll go down there .
you do n't understand . he wants all the money that is in your bank .
you go shoot me if you want , vincent , but you 'll be dead before i hit the ground .
i do n't want you dead , woman , i want the the truth !
perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this ... situation .
this cousin of yours ... what 's his name ?
on an extradition flight back to el salvador , he murdered a security detachment and vanished .
you think it 's possible he could be involved in the israel hit ?
uhh , it 's nice to meet ya . uhh , we got burgers and hot dogs here if you 'd care to join us ?
ca n't stay , i 'm just here because my wife ... ..
... he slices off the guy 's ear , and i mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
cleo , i 've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie ?
a-duh ... you 're a werewolf . and we , as your victims , have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted .
uh huh ... and , supposing i believed that , what could i do about it ?
joanne braslow is getting more and more interesting . i followed her today to an attorney 's office . joseph koehler .
joe koehler . i know him . he 's an estate attorney -- and he 's very expensive .
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face .
watch it , dear boy . i think it was a hallucination . probably a broomstick , or something .
that how you planned it ? you take cut suzie , get me to hang it on kelly , then dump me in the ocean ...
come off it , man ... it was an accident .
you do n't tell us how to run our investigation . you got that ?
you do n't have an investigation without me . you got that ?
i do n't know . why do n't you leave her alone .
mcconnell , i 'm gon na out your ass in two seconds if you do n't tell me where she is .
calm down . you 'll be straight in a few hours .
no . this is serious . one more hour in this town and i 'll kill somebody !
you 're one man . you ca n't save everybody .
what if i could save a handful ? -- what if i could save one ?
he 'll be ready when you do . remember what happened at the apartment .
all right , bruce , what do you suggest ?
thank you , sir . i 've looked forward to this for a long time .
you 've earned it . but i 'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks . i do n't believe these kids can steer .
i was blind . i could n't see past the death of my son . i could n't trust .
i too was blind . i knew about her - and i did nothing . i trusted too much .
eventually you 'll get here on your own . this was just the first step ; in time you 'll take another .
but -- other people from our planet should see what i 've seen -- they should witness this for themselves .
it 'll tell you pretty much everything about us ...
this is very interesting . we are born knowing our history . we have other books . but not a book like this .
honest , toby . i just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox .
stay out of this , jenny . we got man 's business to take care of . i ai n't never taken no drugs , mister , and ...
why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside ?
the time has passed for men like them and me . i know it . but they 're still fighting for survival , like cornered animals . that 's why they 'll kill you . -more-
his only copy . i mean , if you think you 're going to die , what 's more important , a good book or a good smoke ? and so he huffed and he puffed , and little by little he smoked his book .
nice try . you had me going for a second , but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that . would he ?
i 'm a whiskey man myself . we do n't have much trouble from drugs where i come from ...
you will . one of these nights you 'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart .
well , now that is just too bad ! curiosity killed the cat .
yeah , but satisfaction brought him back . can i ?
tower . wolf one . i 've got a problem here .
say your problem , wolf one . are you declaring an emergency ?
he 's a big one . you do n't want to mess with that particular breed .
definitely some sort of fighting spaniel , i think .
oh , certainly . it 's to protect the species .
i imagine that 's very important . especially during the moulting season .
yeah , you know , when you called i thought , there 's a name from the past .
or the future , oh , no , no , i mean ... i mean , we 'll be working on that album cover , right ?
it 's not that it 's hard . i just want you to give me a minute to catch up .
okay . sorry . do n't yell at me like that again , you scared the life out of me .
i heard there was a bit of a fuss .
oh , you know , the usual troublemakers . danny padilla from the sentinel , that crowd .
now calm down walter ! now , let 's go in there , and when the show 's over , maybe we can talk about it .
no ! i want to talk about it now !
well two minutes ago you told me i was n't good enough for your daughter . now you say you 're sorry i got that impression .
i did n't mean it . i do n't think you 'd be right for each other . but i would never say you were n't as good a person as she is .
the range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the p.o.e ... .to even consider it .
i need thirty . calculate in , also , the cash you do n't have to front ...
amanda , as ironic as this is gon na sound , i ca n't take any money for ... i 'm no midnight cowboy , y'know . it would only cheapen the whole deal for me .
i 'm not paying you for the lovemaking , hawk . i just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer .
it 's left its mark still . the last thing these children need to do , is worry about some crazy things happening in the world . take them into town . get their minds -- your mind , on everyday things . it 's good medicine .
it 's good advice ... say hi to marcia for me .
i can explain . they attacked me . gas came out of her ... well , and then they ... and i ...
i believe you , austin . let 's go .
well , bruce -- i do n't think -- that would be possible .
i realize ... the way things have gone between us ... ... i wish you 'd reconsider .
i need you to believe in me . to believe that we can do this .
john , he 's got my driver 's license .
`` row , row , row your boat ... '' i love `` row ... '' do - do you know `` row , row , row , row , row your boat ? ''
that song did not come up in my research , captain .
comrades , why should we lie to each other ? it 's wonderful .
let 's be honest . have we anything like it in russia ?
rita hayworth at the morgue and now veronica lake with white . what the hell 's going on ?
movie star hookers . whatever you desire ... it 's fleur-fr-lis again .
so tabloids do n't have to do re enactments . they going to have real movie this time .
if you kill me and film it you 're putting a noose around your neck .
you 're the psycho ! you have n't been able to deal with anything since high school ended !
you 're the one who 's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy !
i 'm paying attention . i just want to look at it for a minute .
what 's your fucking problem ? you 're a shithead !
limestone quarry , southern mansion . easy to get them mixed up ... i say we invite ourselves to the party .
absolutely . have to look for clues ... even if it means dancing with beautiful women .
it 's your money . it 'll be here in six months when you get out .
and you 're tellin ' me you do n't want any of this cash ?
well , for starters , we 're going to honeymoon in boca for a week . and then , when we get back , morty 's been talking about taking a stable , good paying job as a consultant for the jdl .
well , i could n't be happier for the both of you .
sure . one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago .
his obituary was in every paper . but not one of them said he was murdered .
please let me try . i 'm begging you .
and i am refusing . as of tomorrow , mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir .
yes . good morning , saunders . have you -- uh -- any idea how this happened ?
the ranger 's notices ? no idea at all .
if i was wrong cotton , then he 's still out there .
do n't go there , sid . you 're starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick . do n't freak yourself out -- we 've got a long night ahead of us .
very well , herr laszlo , we will not mince words . you are an escaped prisoner of the reich . so far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us . you have reached casablanca . it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca .
whether or not you succeed is , of course , problematical .
the f.b.i . has nothing remotely similar to this guy . i think he 's a first- timer .
check with the state . if he 's never killed outside of washington the f.b.i . would n't have it . nolan ?
but then we knew that all along , did n't we ...
i guess we did . when you were a little boy , did you want to be a superhero ?
sure you could , earl -- but you would n't want to do that , would you ? you would n't want to kill anybody .
no , no , you 're right . i do n't want to kill anybody . all i want to do is be let alone .
this room has not been used for a long time .
it will never make house beautiful . i guess it 's o.k . for one night .
but it 's not your sword anymore . you gave it to sir te .
true . but i must borrow it for one last mission . jade fox must die at its edge . did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl ?
and when i consider that , i have to wonder if you do n't have some ulterior motive for being here , with me , right now .
i probably do . but for the time being , i 'm willing to forget about it ...
look , all we 've got is what kendall says , and he did n't actually witness any deaths except nunez . he found west , he saw mueller and pike , but just their bodies -- he did n't see any crime committed .
well , i 'm sure if he 'd known this was all going to happen he 'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
well , i 've enjoyed it , too . any ... any ... < u > any < /u > time ... what does the woman want from life ... ?
she wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits .
i 've just made a shocking discovery . the `` enquirer '' is without a telephone . have two installed at once !
i ordered six already this morning ! got a discount !
you got a ten year old attorney , bernie ?
i ca n't afford no better . my ex , she attached my pay check for child support payments . you looking for bernie laplante by any chance ?
i do n't like charles deetz particularly , but you could have < u > killed < /u > him .
hey , i 've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years . i was out . every dog has his day . this is my town . i need a night to howl .
bojo called . said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle .
you gon na preach 'bout turnin ' the other cheek ?
how 'd a guy like you end up in the legion anyways ?
i got caught robbing a synagogue . lots of good stuff in them holy places ; churches , temples , mosques , and who 's guarding them ?
i could wear it longer -- but it 's less trouble this way .
my kid brother has one . you know why ?
wo n't even pretend it is n't a very great favor . i wish there was something i could do for you
well , you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide . there is something you can do for me , miss schuyler .
oh. , no. , sir . i was just assembling my notes .
you know dr. maximus , our commissioner for animal affairs ?
fair katharine , and most fair , will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady 's ear and plead his love-suit to her gentle heart ?
your majesty shall mock at me ; i can not speak your england .
quick question - do you know who i am ?
yes , we sat together at bell 's square .
so what do you want ? ... an autograph .
i do n't know why she 'd pick him over you .
if i had died yesterday , you 'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence .
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?
well ... at the coronation of king charles vi ...
thirty years ago ? i 'm not surprised it 's gone ...
please let me come with you . please please please ...
i do n't know - i 'm not sure it 's a good idea .
you have to believe in something . what do they believe in -- the whatjamacillit church ?
christian reformed . it 's a dutch calvinist denomination .
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday . and no trace until ...
how 'd you and this detective come to trace her to fairvale ?
that 's not cheating . people say crazy shit during sex . one time , i called this girl `` mom . ''
i hit the lights and she freaks . turns out she thought i was brad michaelson .
no . in fact , your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here .
did you talk to the police in east proctor ? did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb ?
because i never have . that 's why you go places , is n't it ?
truman , i think i 'm going to throw up .
no , we do n't ! you 're full of shit ! you say you want to end the war , so why do n't you ? my brother died over there last november . why ? what good was his death ?
i know . i know . i 've seen a lot of kids die , too , in world war ii .
what do you mean ? you 've never been there .
i 've been there every day for the last four years .
he wo n't know you 're carryin ' it . c'mon , you got ta help me out .
sorry , pal . i 'll fix you up , call you a doc , but i ai n't gon na walk into a bunch of knives for ya .
just listen for a second . we got a forty-year-old , gainfully employed black woman , falsely accused --
falsely accused ? she did n't come back from mexico with cocaine on her ?
and little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly , and asked me if i needed i ri-hide --
how the hell do you know all these random songs ?
the thin ... the girl with small eyes . the one in your cupboard .
it 's none of your business . she did n't have small eyes .
good news , bud , the mayflowers have moved up the time-table . you 're hitting the vatican to-night .
tonight ? you 're whacked . the timing 's off , i 'm underequipped damnit , i have a date !
all of it . father perrault and his magnificent history . this place , hidden away from the rest of the world , with its glorious concepts , and now you come along and confuse me entirely .
i 'm sorry . i thought i was to be the light . but why do i confuse you ? am i so strange ?
how come the sun did n't used to shine in here ?
'cause when we bought the house it was autumn . this is summer . feed the dogs .
so do i , jane . i 'm on vacation .
does that mean you 'd consider it in two weeks ? you do n't have to answer now . he wants me to check the deed restriction anyway . you take your vacation , adam . say 'bye !
that is correct . i was engaged to render an opinion .
engaged to render an opinion . for a price . is that correct ? you 're being paid to be here today ?
you better not be ragging me ... if you 're flying upside down ...
no joke , cougar . on the level . even i would n't do that to you .
is n't tony clifton going on taxi soon ? maybe that 'll chill him out .
bob , andy needs to relax . see if you can get him away from all this . take him to hawaii , or bali ... find something special . something nice ...
he had you cut to look like veronica lake ?
no . i 'm really a brunette , but the rest is me . and that 's all the news that 's fit to print .
you learn to sort of block it out , you know , like cops fence off a crime scene . but then something good will happen and everything will just glow .
you must get a lot of overdoses . i bet you picked me up a couple of times .
armored trucks are very difficult to steal , anthony .
i know . but once you get inside you 're home free .
well that 's a lot of land . you must have help . do you have field hands that help you ?
no . we work the land alone . no-one but sister marguerite and i are permitted contact with the public .
yes , but i 'm not working for you any more . i 'm on the other side .
is that so ? i used to think you were two-faced - but you ca n't be - or you would n't be wearing that one . now - let 's talk this thing over .
fine work , pete ! you certainly delivered the goods . i 'm proud of you .
look kind o ' natural , do n't they , fred ?
a few places -- that 's a few jobs . anyway , i do n't want to think about new york .
the mysterious mr ripley . marge and i spend hours speculating . cold beer . thank you dad .
i want sleep more than anything . except maybe , food .
there 's a big diner about ten miles on up ... just outside fairvale .
maybe . but you 're not putting any shit in me this time .
you do n't understand . it 's already in you .
jim ... he < u > wants < /u > it .
you got the enterprise , it 's what < u > you < /u > wanted . this is what i want . but , jim ... ... < u > i 'm < /u > the right choice for this mission .
no you ca n't lose the shot . the meaning of the < u > film < /u > < u > is < /u > in that shot .
but , wally , the window of the < u > firehut < /u > ...
why for ? them boys are real player haters .
it 's a long story . right now we got ta do somethin ' .
the energizer 's bypassed like a christmas tree -- so do n't give me too many bumps .
no promises , mr. scott . on your way .
i 'm so comfortable with that , walt , i ca n't < u > tell < /u > you ...
well , joe said it , and he 's right .
you do n't understand . it 's an addiction . you fight night after night , trying to fill the emptiness . but the pain 's back in the morning . and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice . i want better for you .
save the sermons about how great you want my life to be , okay , bruce ? if it were n't for batman my parents would n't be dead . you do n't get it , do you ? this is all your fault .
well it 's ... it 's a defense mechanism .
defense against what ? insurance ? something they need ? something they should be thanking me for offering ? a little peace of mind ? ...
my grandpa , used to breed horses on his farm so i would come over and ride all the time .
i 'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west . what 's his name ?
do n't open that now . it 's warm .
come on , we 're celebrating . i say we pop it .
all right . i 'll do it . i 'll do it .
thank you , bloom . i knew i could con you .
but that group has been , in the main , subdued . now : how did we come by this information ? and . who subdued that group ?
cain looks down at her script . shrugs , and looks up .
oh , she 's got a cold . she 's in bed . caught it coming home from school . they gave her a flower for a prize and she did n't want to crush it so she did n't button up her coat .
what is it , a sore throat or what ?
no , it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs . '
ugh , not pecs . sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock .
they left me stranded . twice . what have you got to lose ?
nothing i would n't be please to be rid of .
they 've got a real hen house here ! you ca n't hear yourself speak .
tell me the answer to this ! what bird lays eggs in a barn ?
sixth , you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at herald square . look , i make this trip all the time .
first friday of the month ? linens . roll right off the trucks . they 're in and out in twenty minutes ... ... which means they left fifteen minutes ago . traffic will be smooth .
there 's so much i want to say to her , it 's all jumbled up in my mind , and i do n't want her to misunderstand --
well , you 'll just have to < u > make < /u > her understand .
it 's tran , is n't it ? this guy is poison , faith . listen to me . he 's got you walled in on all sides . and he uses the wire too much , he gets off on tape , not on you .
that 's a good one , coming from you .
he does n't belong on this mission . responsible or not , he blames himself . he 's too close to it . and then there 's his wife .
it 's been two years since she died . he 's over it .
chewie ! chewie , give me the gun . do n't move , lando .
no , wait ! i thought you were blind !
peter , you 've got to promise me something . promise you 'll never lie the way charles did . why do people have to tell lies ?
usually it 's because they want something -- and they 're afraid the truth wo n't get it for them .
are you sure you did n't leave the room ... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone ?
i do n't think so . of course i was terribly upset ... i hardly knew what i was doing .
i ca n't believe this . why do n't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn ... animals that attacked my uncle ?
andy , it 's not so easy . there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under paris . it 's a whole other city , crawling with drug addicts , lunatics , skinheads ... it 's no man 's land .
okay , okay . what about magnum p.i . ?
thanks for playing , freb . that 's a gim me ...
it 's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer . one last speedstar .
so , who ... uh , who packed my chute ?
hey , you 're good ! i bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried .
and end up a hunchback like my old man ? you think i 'm crippled ? you shoulda caught him the end of a day .
dirty cops . we 'll have to bring in internal affairs on this .
look , we do n't care if you bring in the state milita , the volunteer fire department , the l.a. thunderbirds , the ghost of steve mcqueen , and the twelve roman gladiators , so long as we get credit for the bust .
well , < u > you 're < /u > the one wo n't work in the car wash. you 're the one 's got ta have a plan .
damn it , val ! not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this !
the police ... the horrible ghastly police . they beat me up , sir . the police beat me up , sir . mr. alexander stares at him . it becomes apparent he is insane .
i know who you are ! is n't it your picture in the newspapers ? did n't i see you this morning on the video ? are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique ?
you need a bigger place - this is like a little kid 's room .
i could never move - i 've got too much stuff .
or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients .
i hope you like it . it 's a marquis cut , carats . they had one with emeralds around it , but this was simpler , more classic in its lines . letty ?
thanks , man . i 've been hating myself for the last two days .
believe me , i know what that 's like . yo , double down ! what time are we leaving ?
there 's not much horsepower left in the engines , but there 's enough noise ... once this baby 's set ... i 'll rev it up ... that slimy bastard will come for it like candy ...
if you blow up your boat , how are we going to get to the island ?
it 's not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone . i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of .
you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
i will also speak with the king , for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to mademoiselle beaufort has caused .
you trust his character more than anyone else does .
i do n't think of us that way - ever .
either do i. i love you , ro . you know that . you 're a total mystery to me - but i love you .
i tell you - this is the only way to travel .
you better put on the lights . i ca n't see what i 'm doing .
without you , my dearest , i might have died without ever knowing love . inexpressible love ! god of nature ! bitterness than which nothing is sweeter , sweetness than which nothing is more bitter . divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes .
let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy .
let 's just ... settle down . ms. fleming has given us a chance to atone for ...
our sins ? what sins ? if you put a nazi in a concentration camp , does that make you a nazi ?
i 'm sorry i was mad at you , theo .
me too . although i learned one thing about you , that you do n't know about yourself . you can be a pretty decent bitch .
i < u > know < /u > . i just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork i 've laid up till now .
i ca n't help you if you do n't help yourself . it 's really up to you . brooding endlessly is n't going to help matters any .
so , no ... immediate suspicion , no ... general talk of enmity between the two .
these are fishermen , alvin . they do n't talk at all to each other and less to me . specially gossip .
i 'm sorry . it was a national emergency -
that hardly makes up for the imposition . now , for what i hope will be the very last time - pay attention , first , computer generated retrograde analysis map . body here , meteorolog- ical influences here , likely vector- ing of the ship 's coordinates here .
i 'm a credit card junkie . i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out . now i 'm trapped in his easy payment plan .
i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers .
you almost sound like that guy from there 's something about carrie . ben . ben damon .
well ya got me . that 's me . i 'm ben damon .
but . . . we can ' t jack , i need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information .
ann ... you 're father is dead . you have nothing to prove anymore .
but i 'm the one in charge of her sorry ass .
she 's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood .
personally i think he has a deep , almost pathological desire to corrupt you . but i suppose that 's a type of love . i certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me .
maybe i should blister through a bottle of tequila and just fuck his brains out .
cock-suckin ' right i do ! ! in the gun lockers !
you guys get those ! earl , rafe , come with me !
you died , starks . years ago , in the hospital .
i know . [ beat ] you killed me , did n't you ?
this is our world , susan , and once you realize that , you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven . science is the quest for divine perfection .
how do you know we 're not heading in the wrong direction ?
andy ? ... what ? what is it ? andy ... are you okay ?
it was you ... that night in the tunnels . you . you did this to me .
you 've never told me why this region 's called the forbidden zone .
no one really knows . it 's an ancient taboo . set forth in the sacred scrolls . the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly .
you 're tellin ' him what he wants to hear , but that ai n't the same thing as kissin ' his ass .
i 'm not lyin ' to him . i mean it . i loved `` coming home in a body bag '' .
yes , and it 's very bad . it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia .
that would scare her to death . she 's terrified of hospitals . to her , a hospital is where you go to die .
good . i have n't decided yet if i 'm a good cook .
hey karl , you know what ? melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february . is n't that somethin ' ?
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping sid , or could be in little pieces on santa monica beach . any idea what sid 's going to do next ?
until we know what new influences are affecting him , we ca n't be sure .
there 's only one person in the world to decide what i 'm going to do - and that 's me . and if you think - if any of you think -
you decided what you were going to do , charles - some time ago . you ca n't always have it your own way , regardless of anything else that may have happened . come on , charles .
mccool 's that same rank . we 're both j.g . 's .
you were commissioned one month earlier , which makes you the senior officer . remember . there are no bad crews -- only bad leaders .
you 're wrong . since i met you , i do n't dream about holes anymore .
holes ? i do n't know what you 're talking about .
hardly a reason to run off with a murderer .

boy , are you ever a shitty judge of people .
virgil , please . do n't do this to me .

mary clarence , do n't be silly . you 're an example to us all . you 've taught us so much . we 're singing for the cardinals , and then -- who knows ? maybe the choir can travel -- to schools , and nursing homes .
maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us .
what about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold ? that 's the only reason we came out here . we 'd have to abandon them all . we 'd be broke .
our lives are more important . anyway , we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat .

ben grimm is a genuine american hero who 's been through a terrible orde --
what he 's trying to say is : every team needs a mascot ...
why should n't be close it ? he went away .
he went away lots of times when i knew him - but he never closed his shop . i 've got a hunch something is up .
you know , that was the hardest part of having to portray you . grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes .
i would 've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint . curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off . you were in such a hurry to knock off that , you never figured out where the virus really was .
please calm yourself . you 'll soon be well if you do .
i do n't need any advice from you ! get me a doctor !
i suppose . though they was leavin ' in a hurry .
it 's all the goddamned money , ed tom . the money and the drugs . it 's just goddamned beyond everything . what is it mean ? what is it leading to ?
i thought maybeuh '' believe you me '' told you a couple of snappy stories .
he apologized for last night . said he did n't know we were married .
i got them all going for oakland . with bullshit money . we 'll cover the $ .

i 've never felt better in my life . when do you get off work ?
my shift ends at four , but i could n't --
your client have a deal in long beach ? how about downtown ? there 's some folks there -- oh , wait , they 're all dead . any of this ring a bell ?
my client is an entrepreneur . i am his lawyer , not his business manager .
i do n't know if whoopi is the way to go .

geronimo . when you 're really in love , you 'll jump . off the top of the empire state . screaming 'geronimo ' the whole way down .
but you 'll die . you 'll squash yourself . what 's the point ?
you 're a bullshit artist , that 's what you are . you got no right to be here ! theo yanks the trophy away from buzz .
i got a right . you 're my father .
could n't you tell a man like that when you saw him ?
no . he would be a hard man to find , jerry . particularly if he were a clever men . he would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him .
stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him .
who are these ruffians ? ... i 've never seen them before in my life ! ...
what 's it like ? imagine you 're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of calcutta , except the beggars are wearing $ suits and they do n't say `` please '' or `` thank you . ''
what about legalizing everything ? has anybody talked about that ?
you are so good to me . will you also allow me to have a botanical garden ?
you may have anything you wish , my sweet and lovely marie-louise .
every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world .
well , has it ever occurred to you that the reason you 've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves ?
i do n't think you can take it personally --
i 'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other -- i should get combat pay --
not at all ... . i understand perfectly , count d'algout gave you a dog . you made it very clear , madame .
dear me ... i must be losing my finesse . if i 'm not careful i 'll be understood by everybody .
but why ? why would she do that ? she 's supposed to marry the guy !
apparently , what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother 's emotional behavior .
you do n't have to be involved , will .
you tell buck and i 'm involved whether i like it or not ...
that 's impossible . the opera has never paid .
well , then , we must give the wrong kind of shows .
actually , he 's not the chancellor 's -- what ?
at first the police thought he just ran away , but this afternoon dr. gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
what d'you pay for a place just for the summer ?
a thousand apiece , something like that . there 's five of us . and we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning , stuff like that .
well , if that 's the way you f ...
damn straight , it 's how i feel ! what 's their wedding gift , a little gold collar that says `` mikey-poo '' ? or do i have to change my name to `` binky '' ?
dad , here ! you do n't have to stop , just slow down . you can tell mama i jumped out . she knows that 's the kind of thing i 'd do . she wo n't blame you .
but i gave her my word . besides , she 's still your legal guardian . my hands are tied .
i know what 's on my birth certificate . you heard from daddy ?
i guess he 's still on the road . what kind of show is this ? are they some negroes in it without being buffoons ?
hey , hannah , did you read that last thing holly wrote ? it was great . she 's really developed .
i know , she ... she really writes good dialogue .
uh , < u > look < /u > ... .
look : okay . okay . look : look you 're driving , countryside , so on , you picked her up , she was hitch ...
oh louis , i just do n't know about this --
i told you last night -- this can be the start of patching things up with your folks . if something good does n't come of gage 's death , i think i 'll go crazy .
where 's my ear ? who 's seen my ear ? did you see my ear ?
outta my way ! here i come , here i come --
will it be possible to have my dog , bijou , sent here ? i was not allowed to bring her and i love her so much .
of course , my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her . and how strange it must be for you to be here , away from your family and everything you know .
because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends .
it does n't have to be like that . we do n't have to be enemies .
do n't give me no trouble now , pace , please . this ai n't the easiest day in a long time . and what do you mean how are we gon na know what your daddy looks like ? you seen his photo .
how 'll he know what we look like ? he seen our photo ?
why did you go in the sphere , beth ?
same reason i put explosives around the habitat . for defense . for the power . to protect myself .
what have you got to be nervous about ? you 're a damn kid . you ai n't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time .
i get nervous , that 's all i know .
i want you to get used to my voice -- you 're going to hear it a lot .
what a horrible death ! do you know what you remind me of ?
i do n't know . maybe because i love you so much , boss .
shit . you should have been married to someone by now . you know , settled down somewhere with a kid or two , a nice steady job .
well , is it real ? do we know anything about it ?
it looks real . i do n't know anything about guns .
the new york pneumatic railway . it was an experimental subway system . fan-forced air-trains , built around .
this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole .
maybe i do n't want to meet someone who shares my interests . i hate my interests ! where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself ?
yeah yeah yeah ... just tell me your five main interests , in order of importance .
look , the ships are clearing out . they 're taking us topside in a matter of minutes . someone can check him out there , if it 's that imprtant .
all i 'm saying is , someone should keep an eye on him .
their loads are poly-drug . `` e '' from holland , methamphetamine precursors from jordan , afghan `` h. '' mid-ocean transshipments . his real business is : he 's a network .
and we can illuminate part of it from the inside out .
and that 's the basis of this `` declaration of independence '' ?
yes , sir . the day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of `` free india . '' then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt .
i think you 're one step away from cutting your ear off .
oh , `` starry night '' time , huh ?
sorry . old habit . i spent three years at fuller seminary before i became a cop . my father was a minister . lutheran .
what does he think of your chosen line of work ?
did they find out anything when they questioned her ?
i do n't know , like i said , she 's not my father 's case .
adhara . i told your father , if you 're looking for a name , you ca n't go wrong with a constellation .
i used to hate it . now i like it .
it 's not because of georgina -- because of dr. macfarlane 's failure ?
it 's not the failure . i feel that macfarlane has taught me nothing . he taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he could n't teach me the poetry of medicine .
he 's right . you 'll get my whole family killed .
he 's right ? look , do n't try to put blood on my hands . you 've got one hell of a nerve siding with him !
you know how i hate gum , misty . all that chomping and cheesing ...
sorry , mom . thanks . hey , chip , think i could get 50c for vanilla ice .
no good . how do we know it 'll effect their biochemistry ? i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . it 's the only way to be sure .
now hold on a second . i 'm not authorizing that action .
until you came along we were going to sonora .
what do you know about that . did you sell your place ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . i know ! wink wink ! nudge nudge !
no , i 'm serious . if you book tony , do not expect to get andy .
i ca n't believe you 're still angry with me , jack , after all this time .
i 'm not angry , richard . in fact , i 'm completely relaxed . thing is , i ca n't tell if it 's the fish that 're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there .
yes , captain . it needed our mortality , the fear of it , our struggle against it , our fears , our dreams ...
... and the 'foolish ' emotions which drive us ?
i want to know . we have n't talked this way in years .
i had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this ?
good morning , drew . thanks for coming out .
well , it 's a big day . wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff . any thoughts ? last minute refine- ments or variations ?
and that 's why you do n't want to be a doctor , fettes ?
not if i have to be party to things like that , dr. macfarlane .
you could have had it done . you did n't want us there .
i would n't have risked killing you to get you out . i was trying to protect you .
twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil , and casanova was their king .
crime was rampant . it was n't safe to stay in your home .
first sign of free will , sense/net usually slags 'em .
this one 's different . no one can trace it . it 's out there somewhere in the matrix and it 's growing stronger ... infecting other computer systems like a virus .
thanks . wow . hey , i want to do something really special for kayleigh tomorrow . if i said i needed some help from you and the brothers ...
i 'd say blow me . get the pledges to do it .
but will you also submit to the decision of the church ?
it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same . why must you complicate what is so simple ?
then what would be enough ? if we were married ?
i would n't want you to marry me just to prove something .
i was fired by wyant wheeler . i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners .
you want to sue wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown ?
goddammit , goddammit ! ! that son of a bitch ! ! well , at least i know you did n't fuck him .
no , but i wanted to . i really wanted to , partially just to piss you off .
you think that matters ? you think they give a shit about anything ? the little bastards .
but it is n't right , paulie . that tommy , he 's making trouble for me all over town . i ca n't go here . i ca n't go there .
really ? who ? where do you meet them ? in a chat room ? how do you know he 's not some middle-aged freak ?
dad , i can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away .
dexter grayson , you told me it was only ten thousandand you did n't even get those letters from that jezebel !
oh , so you did give her ten thousand dollars , eh ? and there are letters ...
so . i wo n't be seeing her ? your clients usually visit me after the settlement .
not this one . not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery , which , incidentally , she does not need .
i do n't communicate very well through a shroud .
if max does n't like what you have to say , you 'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely .
insignificant ... he 's a secretary , always < u > was < /u > a secretary , always < u > will < /u > be .
funny -- the first time i saw him i thought he was a doctor !
yes i do . your son is a material witness to a homicide .
you do n't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !
you should never wish to get melodramatic over anything .
yes , you 're right . i 'm sick and tired of being like that .
do n't you think you should at least wave ?
why ? then they 'll notice when i 'm gone . well . i 'm making a public appearance are n't i ?
here 's another twenty . will that do ? i mean , what 's it going to take !
no..no , it's..i do n't know what to say . this is so nice of you ... jack ...
please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know , do n't hesitate to ask us .
now that you mention it , i sure would like to call my aunt up in portland and tell 'er where i am so she can come visit me .
mrs de moraes must have taken it hard , eh ? her brothers death .
dial o-o-o on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink , sir .
they are also very religious . so , we will attack them three days from now , on christmas . one force under me , and another to the south under colonel cadwalader ...
george , i 'm afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide . i see where we 're headed , you 're putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold ...
but that 's a circular argument ! if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition , they cancel each other out .
oh ! stop talking as if we were married !
that he was -- satisfied in that regard . i did n't want to pry .
it 's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office .
`` in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree . . . `` how big is it , all told ? the estate ?
the whole joint is half the size of rhode island .

overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout . that 's new york living .

yeah , well , we need a ride somewhere , we 'll let you know .
tv , man ! farrah fawcett 's interested in playing my mother !
farrah fawcett ? ! who 's gon na play my brother ? is jason priestly available ?
then why especially does it have to be in german ?
well not especially . it can be in turkish , if you really want . i do n't care .
... and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer ...
talia , you know how important our friendship is to me and i would never do anything to ...
so what are you saying , marlon , the whole thing has been in my head -- ?
not the whole thing , truman . you were right about one thing .
so you do n't know what i 'm thinking .
no , i do n't . though i have to say i 'm curious .
remember whose office this was back in '63 ? lafayette street .
yeah , guy banister . ex-fbi man . he died couple years ago .
koros , as in ... koros ? dimitri koros ?
my grandfather . my god , i ca n't tell you what a fan i am of yours ! you were magnificent in deadly gamble .
um , because you did n't want to go .
like i 'm going to pay twenty bucks to see neil moynihan in some band that i helped start .
i ca n't get out of here til mid- morning . i 'll be in tomorrow night ... listen , could you call a number for me , it 's in mississippi ...
okay . hold on a second ... what is it ?
i 'm glad you think so . if you ask me , it 's foolish . i told you there 's no sense in our staying here tonight . we could make new york in less than three hours .
i could n't arrive in new york at three in the morning . everybody 's in bed .
i 've got bigger problems , joanna . personal problems .
that 's not all , nicky . i 've been backing your plays for fifteen years . and i 've never been more depressed .
they need the money for my band uniform at school .
i thought you quit the band - i never hear you practice anymore .
sorry , but it 's out of my hands . try again next year .
no , it is n't out of your hands or you would n't even have met me . if i push you have to let me back in . dead hero father rule . sir .
`` ... you have to believe in yourself ... ''
na , fuck the leads , i 'm going home .
anyway , that never use to happen . i was always the prodigy . now i 'm just one of the guys .
maybe some of the discomfort you 're feeling is ... guilt . remorse . over the innocent people you 've killed .
uh , yeah . thanks , mr..uh ... face .
just call us harvey . can we get you a sandwich ? a soft drink ? given all the trouble we caused you , how about we cut you in for a share of tonight 's haul ?
are you sure ? about me , i mean ?
i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you 're what i want .
yes and the old man used to come to my garden . he would read and rest there .
come now , mr. jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years , since he fractured his spine .
i 'll play the piano again . on polish radio .
tell me your name . i 'll listen out for you .
well you look great . are you married , do you have kids ?
nope , nope -- dodged a few bullets . god , i can not believe i 'm standing here with mary jenson .
it 's the president 's personal property ! i will never give up my tapes to a bunch of kennedy-loving harvard democrat cocksuckers !
this could trigger the impeachment . they 'll go to the supreme court next .
... the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars ...
do n't give me that crap . that 's my crap .
she 's not alone ... she 's ... boyd ... oh god ... he 's gone nuts ... he killed lois and micheal ... it 's all ...
stop ! you stop right here . i do n't want to know anymore . i told you not to do this bachelor party thing . you were warned .
it 's the kind of situation , you do n't pay , you get your legs broken .
or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken . you have to understand the loan shark 's in business the same as anybody else . he is n't in it to hurt people . he 's in it to make money .
... the better to eat me with , your dear ?
to print the newspaper . and i 'd come to < u > write < /u > . to write . to write . right here in the office .
he 's in the fluoroscope now . listen to his heart . impressive , huh ? the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and does n't even feed the limbs anymore . it 's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins ... until now .
how long can he stay down ? without breathing ?
there are infinite worlds out there , where anything that can happen does happen .
so on one you are rich , on another poor . on one you are a murderer , on another the victim .
what , you do n't think i can beat him ?
he is the southern heavyweight champion . he 'll kill you . first , you piss-off women . then you piss-off the south . then you get killed ! and i did the bookings .
someone with whom you do n't have quite so personal a --
i < u > like < /u > our history . and i like you . i 'd probably like < u > brill < /u > if i ever got to --
that 's right , mister . you better be afraid . i told you it was n't over , but you did n't listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .
i was n't sneaking around with your girl . would you please tell him ?
they really got all that money , them whores ?
you know how women kin lie ... i knock 'em around a little , ask 'em where the money is , they say they do n't have none ? ... but they coulda squirreled away that much , the five of 'em . maybe .
exactly what i mean . it 's all ruined .
it 's not ruined , for fuck 's sake . it 's one of your parties .
now there 's a picture i 'd like you to --
you said someone killed them , you said you know who , you said that .
well , if the a.t.f . guy is the one who wants you , that 'll only interest him up to a point .
it 's a lot of money . about a half-a- million dollars . all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin ' in .
... no wine -- bad for ya ' brain .
c'mon , man , it 's cold , man .
i 'm a writer . ted okum said you 're producing this wallace beery picture i 'm working on .
what ! ? ted okum does n't know shit . they 've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year . what ted okum does n't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl .
no , i happened to see you come in , and i thought --
0h , i thought so ! a pick-up ! well , you 've got a nerve , following me right into the hotel and up to my room ! you beat it ! go on ! beat it !
because you refuse to believe she 's serious . you 've always refused .
do n't be so steely-eyed . it 's that course you 're taking in criminology .
he ! ! ? ? how dare this person take advantage of my weakness .
i do n't think he intends to go that far .
i 've gotten to know someone who 's famous .
not so famous any of us have ever heard of him .
before we go in i got ta tell you this is n't going to be pretty .
i know that . i 've seen the photo 's .
have you been able to analyze < u > any < /u > of this ... ?
i believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel 's inner mechanism . a technology so incredibly sophisticated that i can not --
i told you , i 'm good at this .
plus you have nothing else to do all day .
yes , as a matter of fact , it is .
you do n't know many of citizen barras ' friends , do you ?
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows ? there must be something .
i have nothing to reproach myself for . all i know is that i 've changed . with all my strength , which is not much , i will follow the road that the lord has shown me . one can also serve outside a convent .
where 'd you learn to do that , soldier ?
uni high tigers , sir . do n't you remember ? i was captain of the team .
why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop ?
none of this stuff was here in the valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards .
i ca n't just leave . i have a life here , a career --
not anymore . you 've seen one of them . you wo n't be allowed to live after that .
some plain soda . lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven ...
that 's for tonight . you 're invited . we 're having everyone up after the performance .
it feels wrong , jack ... like a trap .
there 's more than one way to spring a trap .
oh , no . how could you ever think of such a thing ?
oh , i realized right away . he 's really a very nice fellow , hildy -- i found that out .
well , we 'll each probably want one - so let 's make it five . five should do it .
okay . how much ammo you reckon you 'll need ?
you did the right thing . never try to understand a press message . about half the time we use codes -- especially with dr. gonzo .
tell me . when will the doctor be awake ?
gosh . that 's the third motorcyclist that 's passed us . they certainly take their lives in their hands . what with the weather and all .
yes , janet . life 's pretty cheap to that type .
i 'm massaging his heart . i saw it done once .
are you crazy ? ! ! stop it ! ! !
chief , maybe you had a little too much to drink .
bullshit ! bartender , another round ... here 's to the new frontier . camelot in smithereens . i 'll drink to that .
merle ? ... merle 's alive ? how do you know ?
i saw him last night . i thought i was dreaming . i thought i was out of my mind .
a million years behind us . jor-el , he 's only a baby .
their atmosphere will sustain him . he will look like one of them .
screen classics ? hmm , do n't know them .
nobody in town has seen it , so i 'm givin ' you first crack at my talents .
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me . if i do not know it , i am innocent .
but you deceive me nonetheless if i believe you , for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer .
it 's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive .
you ca n't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits ...
if it 's not asking too much -- for our information just for illustration tell us how you intend to run the nation .
these are the laws of my administration : no one 's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- and whistling is forbidden ...
i have no doubt that he has , your majesty , but does he have any strong moves from which to choose ?
well , one thing immediately comes to mind , if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from moscow and return to poland for the winter .
i do n't have the money for those bourgeois traps . hell , i 'm making what a czech earns .
yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints !
what are you talking about ? the east side is always faster .
but we can get to the west side faster .
there 's no danger . the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields , it 's under control .
your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart . it may have killed one of my men . no one goes near that thing .
child seems to take to the lad . what sort of an accident was it , ma'am ?
a carriage overturned . my husband was killed and georgina was hurt .
yes -- is it all right if i come like this ?
this time i 'm really glad you showed up .
i do n't have any money . switches on the light . jani is looking distressed .
some people i know , they 're planning to rob the golden lion .
what if i went up and introduced myself -- think he 'd slug me ?
well , we are trying to ruin his life .
it has been said , my friend , that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means .
how can anyone say that ? we have no cook , no maid . we have no footman . nothing at all !
i ... i just hired these guys to watch my back ...
motherfucker , we 're handing you money . what the hell we gon na pull ?
andre zhdanov ? how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov ?
who does n't know about the infamous composer 's conference of where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music - shostakovich , prokofieve , and myaskovsky .
but i ca n't have any . is that what you mean ?
only what 's on the menu ... a number two : plain omelette . it comes with cottage fries and rolls .
depends what he told you . about bill , you mean ?
all of it . about him , an ' you an ' uncle pete ... about robbin ' the rock island pacific ... an ' about them missouri banks .

... just wan na be a good mom , a nice person , a decent citizen . just wan na take good care of my kids . you know ?
make sure you find ben , bring him back here . and keep it quiet . i do n't need this to hit the press .
yes sir . you 've got the mayor at eight , then a nine-thirty interview with the journal --
i ca n't believe there 's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks .
america 's bored . now , what do you want ?
it helps . it has ever since king david wooed bathsheba with the harp . as i am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand , i shall turn on the radio .
i should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five .
just tell me , did you talk with him ?
he said he 'd consider it . it 's between you and rodriguez .
what for ? she 'll only look at me that way again ... i could n't . you go . perhaps she 'll listen to you . try to convince her .
but what can i say to her , sir ?
just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth . just a chip of ice .
i 'll give you anything you want , jake . i think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break .
no relation . never heard of him . sorry .
say steve , where 's your manners ? here 's mutt 's brother and you do n't offer him a drink ? want some bourbon ?
so -- you 've come to ask for clemency ! i 'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime ...
but your excellency -- the ambassador is here on a friendly visit ... he came to ask you to patch up the breach .
`` harold , the patron saint of taxidermy . ''
what does he do -- of an athletic nature ?
maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little ?
okay . you did n't like the party , huh ?
they 're gon na kill us . they get us across the border , they 're gon na take us out in the desert and shoot us .
if they get over the border , they 're gon na let us go .
you got ta turn yourself in . before it 's too late -
they 're inside the department , they 're everywhere - it 's not safe .
i can see you 're real concerned about your daughter .
utopia is lost to me . my daughter is gone .
good luck . that guy 's been in there since i got here .
well , i guess i better look for another one , then . thanks , anyway .
let her go . she 'll be ok. sorry about that .
do n't worry . she 's bound to be upset .
the s.s. men are here to pick up dunbar . they 're taking him to berlin . looks like he 's finished .
only he ai n't quite finished yet . blondie -- get that smudge pot . tie it to steve 's leg .
i want you to know right now that the trial 's going to be nasty . your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud . they 're going to say that you enticed marsh -- led him down a dark path .
andrew hardly needed leading . he was a very passionate man . he was eager to explore . i gave him what he wanted . we fulfilled each others needs .
niagara falls ! walter , you do n't mean that ?
sure i do . and i 'll tell you something else -- i 'd like a baby .
doug you said you would n't be long . come on , i 've got to go . now !
alright , i 'm coming . it 's the perfect place jahn , thanks .
it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum .
what in the world are you talking about ? six ounces -- ?
it 's a new deal . ... coming with me tomorrow ?
sugai 's not going to be impressed with your gun , nick . no . i wo n't put myself in danger for you anymore .
you like to work alone . i 've heard that about you .
i 've heard of you , too . you were in with bargamian .
'leave bees be - and the bees be nice . ' did n't your father ever teach you that ... ?
that 's a wasp . fuckers 'll sting a tree if they 're bored- so - where is she ... ?
hea < u > ther < /u > , i 've got something going with j.d .
please veronica . put billy the kid on hold tonight , i 'll never forget it .
oh . well , i have got to get to the dentist be- ...
... -fore he closes , which means you 're gon na have to cover the grill and the floor .
doing great , mom , do n't worry about me .
there 's settled folks , and there 's nomads . you 're just not a settled folk . you never belonged here .
you bastard ! you 'd do that , would n't you ?
why worry ? you 'll like it . nothing in the world like a mace high . forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves ...
even those delicate veins , the texture of this flesh -- i have never seen anything more exquisite .
my partner believes that i should build a horror chamber , immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of london . at such times marie antoinette has reassured me , she has promised me recognition for the devotion i gave to her .
yeah . i was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy .
what 'd you say we 're supposed to be doing ?
am i afraid of them ? not during the day . sea snakes are diurnal . when the sun 's out , they do n't bite . fortunately for you , i had on my watch . this is quite good .
what are they doing down here ? in the bathroom ? suddenly appearing .
we ca n't just walk out on her without saying goodbye .
since when ? usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth .
i have a feeling there 's some very interesting space behind this door .
probably the world 's largest < u > reader 's < /u > < u > digest < /u > collection ! c'mon , let 's have some chablis , otho , i 'm laid bare by this experience . entirely bare .
father ! thank god you 're better ! i really need your help . we 've only got a few more hours .
do n't worry ... about the transformation , maya .
hey , you , secret service man , what are you --
stay out of it , carter . you 're going back to l.a .
doctor , we 're still conducting an investigation into the attack . once we 've completed our work , we 'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory . until then-
the timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours , years of research will be lost .
wo n't those two years in court be expensive for you ? i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people , but now ...
i may run out of money , but you have already run out of bread . two years is a long time for your comrades to wait .
that 's where i was going ... mulholland drive .
maybe that 's where the accident was . there must be a police report . we could call .
but they 're certainly dead . and yes , personally , i find it a bit odd .
it could happen . what about his state certification exams ? the records seem to be in order .
well , a tall handsome ubangi , i suppose .
no , not that bad . it was a fella that sends you flowers every day . er , what 's his name ? mr. norton 's nephew .
i see ... ... and you are really a gardener , are n't you ?
yes , robert - i am . i 'll go tell eve about ben now , robert .
i do n't know . it would n't be very smart .
listen , you 're right . do n't do it . i 'll just ... send you an address , okay ?
you want some advice ? do n't do this again . you know exactly what i mean .
beverly , there were many reasons why you and i ...
and she did give him the chance , the way it worked out .
if she did n't -- if luck was against him -- he wipes the gun off , reaches the wall up there -- drops it on the chaise .
hey . you do n't know that shit for sure .
oh , jesus . you 're such a fuckin ' retard !
your story was rigfort 's baby . we were scooped ! we 've got nothing . zippo . you totally and completely screwed both of us .
maybe i could talk to rigfort , you know , tell him the whole story .
hey , great idea . what i 'll do is , tomorrow i 'll get a hold of a box full of mint elvis presley 78s on the sub label , and i 'll pay for it that way .
i 'll pay for you . even though you owe me money . we have to do something with the money i earn . i need to . i deserve it . you can just think of it as winning the lottery .
there 's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
yeah , yeah . that 's what i 'm thinking --
i 've been here . i guess i have n't been out .
i thought maybe you 'd like to come over , have some dinner , some of the people are coming over .
you 're getting gold , and you 're going to blow it on wheels ?
what are you going to do with your < u > third < /u > ?
this little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us ! you are a bad man !
and you call yourself a canadian ! i told you we should of done leno !
it is and i do n't . ordinarily ... but , i mean ... there 's this kid standing in front of you crying ...
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet t-shirt with no bra ...
daniel balint ? my name 's guy danielsen . i 'm a reporter with the < i > new york times < /i > .
< i > new york times < /i > ... ?
you know , walking on the beach , holding hands , kissing , making love ...
that sounds kinda gay , but since you 're a guy , i guess it 's okay .
you 're the fuckin ' animal ! you ran around with every guy i knew while i was breakin ' my ass for you .
you 're not only an animal , you 're a stupid animal . you 're rotten . rotten . rotten . you 're a sick maniac . a maniac ! you belong in a mental hospital .
i 'm afraid . i 'm afraid for samuel . i want to go home .
you 'll be safe . you do n't have to worry .
yes , mr. jimmy . an interview . after so many years . very exciting .
do n't be daft . it 's just a student from the university .
breakfast beetle ? beetle ? beetle fruit ? fruit bat ? fruit battle ? volkswagen ? fruit wagon ?
good thing you are beautiful , kid . you are < u > dumb < /u > !
call me irish , but i do n't believe in cooler heads prevailing .
acheson 's scenario is unacceptable . and he has more experience than anyone .
you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ?
he 's not with us , xander . he must be with you .
it strains me past the compass of my wits .
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise , and with this i 'll help it presently !
um -- hello ? i 've got like a social emergency here .
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him ?
tell them what ? ! what , thelma ? what do you think we should tell them ?
i do n't know . just tell 'em what happened .
what do you know about people ? you live like an animal ! a savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here , as far away from the rest of us as possible .
i 'm real sad you do n't approve of me .
i 'll tell you how . like - let 's see - like she was studyin ' you , like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints . how you walk , talk , think , eat , sleep-
i 'm sure that 's very flattering , birdie , and i 'm sure there 's nothing wrong with that !
it does n't matter . there is no exit visa for him .
louis , whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape ?
does n't say what she 's doing up here , but i do n't think it has anything to do with us .
she came up here on her vacation , 'cause she likes shitty weather .
'cause i just do n't buy it . call it instinct . call it years of professional know-how ...
i call it 'nutty ' as my shit after i eat almond roca ...
what do i care what you think about how he looks ? you wan na fuck my partner or do business ?
wait by the phone . you get a call . or maybe you do n't . until then , piss off back to where you come from ...
you say murder , but you have no idea what happened . you do n't remember doing it , so it 's out of your control .
i think i turned into a werewolf and killed him .
i do n't want to talk about it . i want you to go .
edie , listen to me ! i want you to believe me . i want to be with you .
you can tell when people believe you . it 's obvious .
well i do n't have that skill and if i had to guess i would say that in no way did she believe me .
i 'm not from the sea ... i do n't understand what you 're talking about .
yes you do . you know exactly what i 'm talking about . you 're afraid i want to hold onto you , and i do , but you 're not ready ... at least not for me .
it 's okay . it 's martin the door begins to open revealing debi and newberry .
i know what i do is n't moral , per se , but if you could just look past that , you 'd see a man worth loving .
well , in the garage , back home , we --
and how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it ? or hundred knives you 've probably owned in your lifetime ?
yeah , i guess so . anyway , there 's hardly anybody to play with around here .
yeah , i know . it always takes a little time to make new friends .
well , i 'm sorry , i-i ca n't ... i-i- i 've got ta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish , 'cause- 'cause i 'm anal .
h'h , that 's a polite word for what you are .
elaine , i 've come to apologize for lt. mcelroy . he overstated the department 's position .
he accused john of taking kickbacks . and you know  anybody who knows john  knows that 's a goddamn lie !
they 're dead now . we can get help .
i know how they reward failure . if they saw this i 'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others .
you lie ! you wish to humiliate me , as if the form i 'm forced to bear were not punishment enough !
you should glory in your animal nature . it is your triumph ! none know that better than i !
i take it you do n't like miss lawson very much ?
i really do n't know her that well . we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house , but that was about it .
i think clinton is a breakthrough . shaw denies he knows ferrie or oswald . is that right ? it proves he 's a liar . keep on it , bill .
this is interesting - are you ready for this ? oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination . it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house , supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald .
strange , major . there was a firefight . shooting in all directions .
i ca n't believe jim hopper walked into an ambush .
well , hell , you got the whole chicago south side . how do ya expect the eight lousy spots i 've got to compete with that ?
they did grand in evanston , is gary , and in cicero . looks like you 're bringing up the rear , granger .
no future-telling , please , i 've been terrified enough for one day .
narcissus ! terrified ? you ? the only thing he 's scared of is me .
yeah . i figured i 'd be hearing from you .
if you ever want to get those tapes , meet me in one hour at grant park near the statue .
hey , i know this is a strange thing to say , but maybe diane court really likes lloyd .
if you were diane court , would you honestly fall for lloyd ?
a 4th of july beach is like ringing a dinner bell , for chrissake !
i just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there .
that 's what we need here , satch . a lucky break .
that was n't luck , johnny boy . that was smarts and ten plus on the job .
dad , it 's not about that . i just need to know that it 's possible for two people to stay happy together forever . or at least for a few years .
it 's not easy , that 's for sure . now , i may not have the best track record in the world , but i have been with your stepmother for ten years now , and i 'm proud to say that we 're very happy .
so that 's it ? you do n't ever want to see me again ?
no , of course i do ... it 's just that right now i need to --
you 're not death . you 're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants .
the jacket and the pair of pants came with the body i took . let me ask your opinion . do i blend in ?
it 'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes .
calvin , i insist i be allowed to capture it !
your fond wishes give me strength , dear friends .
no speeches ! what 's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres ?
why are you depressed ? you get in all the clubs , you never pay cover ...
stop . we still got serious detective stuff to do , but we 've been up all night so we should hit the sack for ...
you 're welcome . your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction . your observations are distorted , ungrounded an incomplete . you must be very proud .
i 'm not a boastful man . what 's your point ?
jesus , so much for delicacy . i pegged you for a master of understatement , beating around the bush and all that buzz .
i use it but i do n't understand it when other people use it .
so , what , you liked it because it was shiny ?
no , because it 's the egyptian goddess bast .
i would 've paid more . i wanted to know everything about you . then you came down here after johnny got killed ... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better .
what about the other night . what about last night ? was that to get to know your character ?
you bet . you gon na be staying up here ?
well , yeah ! there 's going to be major research up here . first thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up .
really ? my day ? well , i had a sweet little mongrel puppie named puff when i was a girl . this one reminds me of my dog , all shaggy ! so cute ! i loved my doggie very much , monsieur .
puff it is then . puff bronfman . is that okay ?
for you . this is where you wanted to be .
but i never had a wife , children , a home like this .
ashamed ? no -- i love you , lynette . i mean that . after i leave them , i 'll meet you at the motel , okay ?
if you wo n't take me to dinner with your parents , i wo n't meet you at the motel .
you think what we 've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells ... like hamburger ?
no . i think what we 've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon ... who wants us to believe he 's a monster .
that seems so far away from who you are now . what happened ?
i broke my ankle skating . that ended that dream .
my assistant quit today . okay ? he was highly valuable to the project .
oh , baby . i 'm sorry . ca n't you hire somebody else ?
yeah . i do n't see a way out of it .
macey , i know you 're tired , but can you drop me at the retinal fetish ? it 's on your way .
you 're actually having sex with your own little girl ? is that possible ?
ai n't nobody havin ' *sex* with my little girl , homer -- that 's somethin ' a father knows .
i 'm not asking you anything . i 'm telling you what i 'm going to do !
and you think i will permit this , my friend ?
i thought maybe i could put in a word for you with mr. sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter ?
i 'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me .
there 's a lot of carbon scoring here . it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action ...
indeed , sir , sometimes i 'm amazed we 're in as good shape as we are , what with the rebellion and all ...
hold it . whoa ... what 's your name , son ?
tommy jarvis . we got ta do something . he 's even more powerful now that ...
loud and clear , kid . what 's up ?
i 've finished my circle and i have n't picked up any life read- ings .
frank , but not now . frank . you 're trying to wipe out some old business . but not now . i understand . but you go call 'em back . you call the bishop back .
i have to try this case . i have to do it , mick . i 've got to stand up for that girl . i need your help . mick , will you help me ... ? will you help me ... ?
`` with that , fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched , that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue -- ''
`` with that , fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched , that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue -- ''
you know as much as i do , miss schmidt - you were intimate with lime , were n't you ?
we loved each other , do you mean that ?
i trust you 're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus .
no , we 're moving you off campus . the board of regents has decided to terminate your grant . you are to vacate these premises immediately .
this is bullshit , george . we 're never going to find anything down there .
you know , he 's got a point . we 're fucking americans . we stick out like sore thumbs .
no . he was strong , he lasted almost a month . my mother - died when i was very young , so my father had become - the whole world to me ... after he left me , i had nobody . i was ten years old .
you 're very frank , clarice . i think - it would be quite something to know you in private life .
why not ? we do n't owe buddy-boy anything .
yeah . what 's buddy-boy done for us lately ?
i 'm calling you , i 'm standing in my hotel room , i came because i have my business trip --
well let 's do something do you want to do something , can you meet me ?
what did i tell you ? what did i tell you ? buy the road map and leave .
what am i supposed to do , seth ? he recognized us .
buddy , you do n't realize it but what you 're doing is n't nice .
aw , come on , rose , i want to see what the nipple on it is like .
if i was smart i would n't be working my way over on this ship .
we did n't have enough dough for two tickets , did we ?
how 'd your interview go ? i 'm sure you charmed the hell out of sally .
she 's a talk show host . they ca n't be charmed . by definition .
why do you think they call him jangle leg ?
somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year .
you know what she is ! that 's death -- no mind , no senses -- no love , no hate , no feeling -- nothing !
please , wes , do as i ask . you must rest , you must sleep .
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast ?
exactly . now that you have the studio behind you , we can really do things .
a thousand times the worse , to want thy light . love goes toward love , as schoolboys from their books , but love from love , toward school with heavy looks .
romeo ! at what o'clock to-morrow shall i send to thee ?
water . worth killing for out here , i 'd think .
get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars .
god , i just wan na speak to you . i just wan na speak to you the way i feel about you .
hurry up , you 're wastin ' my time , what the fuck .
how do you know there 's two ounces in a drink ?
i 'm a nurse . i always watch people when they pour something . i watched ti-joseph and it was exactly two ounces .
antiques ? what the fuck do we know about antiques ? we rob post offices and steal cars , what the fuck do we know about antiques ?
if it looks old , it 's worth money , simple . so stop fucking moaning and rob the place .
do n't stop . keep right on complaining . it 's beautiful .
you know , when i first saw you , i thought you were an american .
is that the logical thing to do , spock ... ?
no , admiral ... but is the human thing to do .
did you do that when you were a kid ?
well , yeah . sort of . nothing really mean . me and my pals , me and my brothers . it was kind of funny then . stealing pumpkins , soaping windows . stuff like that .
and keep your lashes on your lids where they belong . how could you be so careless ?
i 'm sorry . i think i was crying .
kenai at the general store asked me to bring these . did n't expect we 'd already met .
no big deal . we just got off on the wrong foot . what 's your name ?
your first homicide , that 's gon na happen , ray ...
i just wan na make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer .
i ca n't believe i listened to one word of his shit .
but if he 'd been sent to jail , there would be no jody .
there 's no need for any of this . your condition can be treated . whistler and i were working on a cure when --
what makes you think we want to be cured ? blood is only part of the equation . the hunt , the killing , that 's what the thirst is really about .
you 're lucky he did n't cut your *nipples* off , man .
the good news , jack , is you 're half- undressed for *swimmin'* ...
aw , you know i do n't like to count , johnny .
it 's good for you . develops your mind .
no , the problem is one 's dead , one 's got a bullet in his arm , and one wo n't talk . the one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up .
i 'm assuming that 's what made him the dead one ?
i contacted ernie roman 's manager , he 's fighting in france the same week .
then gim me buddy shaw -- he 's ranked fifth .
yeah , i suppose ... dad , who 's harry york ?
well , harry york is a guy who ... well , he does a lot of things . why do you ask ?
why do n't you do the same , doyle ? you look like shit .
look . my partner and i found this case and i do n't want no feds screwing it up .
if rick has the letters , he 's much too smart to let you find them there .
you give him credit for too much cleverness . my impression was that he 's just another blundering american .
not for the kind of place i want to do . i wo n't be in chicago that long .
when you get back , i 'll be gone --
my american express ... my bloomingdale 's credit card ... my check book --
okay , okay ... what is it this time ? what did i do now ? ...
sebastian , please . i do n't want us to end on bad terms .
well , i 'm afraid you do n't have a choice in the matter . you make me sick . you 're a hypocrite and i do n't associate with hypocrites .
he needs extreme cold to survive . his cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees .
let me get this straight . a brilliant citizen , disfigured by a horrible accident , re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft , revenge and destruction . you see a pattern here ?
have another one , sounds like you need it .
naah , i 'm done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . are n't you going in ?
well ! a precedent is being broken . er , emil !
this is a very interesting cafe . i congratulate you .
you got that right , mikey ... you still believe that , do n't you ?
yes . i think it will be a simple solution . they 'll put it in a syringe , inject it into your bloodstream . it 'll neutralize the virus . it 'll revitalize the immune system , and people with aids will become healthy again .
you 're home late ... or should i say early ?
why are you still here ? you killed a policeman . you should leave ! you 'll bring ruin on my whole family .
well , i mean , business is okay , and lacrosse is awesome , but what am i gon na be , a pro lacrosse player ? i really have no idea .
oh thank god , i thought i was the only one .
you thought the deceased might ... break his promise ?
of course not . we 're just not quick to run and boast . in case something went wrong .
what right you got to be talkin ' marriage to any decent woman ...
if you 're talkin ' about that crazy murder charge ...
i need to repair my turbo boosters . do you people still use fossil fuels , or have you discovered crystalic fusion ?
well , let 's see , we 've got double a 's --
do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser , deborah ? and then , your brothers not buried yet . as i said earlier , an autopsy will ...
he ... he is dead ! my husband is dead ! call my parents . theyll tell you . call them !
you 're lint ! you 're a flea ! you 're a blip !

here 's a fresh one . why you ? your colleague mr. wilson says jerry wo n't speak to anyone else . that seems oddly possessive behavior to me .
i 'm sorry . what was the question again ?
i 've spoken to friends of mine and my husband 's , in harrisburg , in lancaster and hershey . asking about you . i must say you have friends in influential places .
i 've been privileged to provide services for people i admire .
the pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet .

you do n't have anything < u > for < /u > her either . come on , it 'll be very . the note 'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks .
it 's hard to say . doctors thought she 'd come home a week ago . all it was was appendix .
all they got is advertisements . just like l.a .
because i 'm telling you the truth . i know what 's going to happen . there 's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants . and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon . on july , .

you 're shitting ion your career . you outrank hi ...
think a soul could get lost there ? with all those pilgrim-types ?
it 's more a place where souls are found , mr. riddick .
what about drake , did he ever show up ?
no , it 's weird , man . nobody knows where he went .
we tried to point that out . but there were some pretty nosey citizens who would n't listen to reason . they said aspen had outgrown us . it 's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon .
i knew something would happen when they started puttin ' up fences and passin ' laws .

gate 's open . i had a butcher 's at the house .
oh they 'd never let me do what i want .
i get final approval . it 's in my contract .
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
you wo n't consider another course of action , for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you ?
sixty three pounds consumed per capita , up from twenty seven in going to pass beef . chicken 's global . no religious taboos . you do n't see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry .
true enough . no sacred chickens nowhere , so far as i know .
i do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death , but i hold no prisoners-of-war .
if that 's your position , then eighteen of your officers will die . nineteen , if you hang me with my men .
sure i do . there was some kind of mutiny on the base , and you killed general ripper .
look , general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd bomb wing to attack with h-bombs .
whoa ! hold it ! pipe down ! come on , now -- that 's enough of that .
if you thought as much of being honest -- as you do of being smart -- !

what your mother means , clark , is that she do n't want folks to think you 're special .
you 're a jew . maybe you do n't realize it , but you are .
maybe i am . maybe we 're all jews now . what 's the difference ?
i know . i suppose you heard about mr. sheldrake -- ?
you mean , leaving his wife ? yeah . i 'm very happy for you .
there is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return . from there it infects our dreams . our thoughts . grigory gave us a glance tonight --
grigory -- that 's russian , right ? thought they were on our side ...
you 'll have to be more specific than that , sir .
all right , it 's a matter of death .
what does it mean ? i ... i mean we , you have other tactics ...
we , yes . yes . they , they present their side , and i get the same chance . to cross-examine ... to ... to ...
oh , oliver . what are we going to do ?
no ! i do n't know what janet 's next move will be ... but you can be sure of one thing ... it all starts here !
they wo n't take him ; not for a million , not for ten million .
his medical condition is reported as ... & quot ; terminal. & quot ;
... routine calls , they have to click off after a few minutes .
yeah , and i get a sprained fuckin ' elbow .
and i got you down here fixing fuckin ' boat motors .
you do n't need me . i would n't be useful to you anymore , jack .
aiiee . more waiting ? i do n't know if i like this plan .
it will take the entire day , but he will begin to doubt himself . he will begin to believe that he missed me , that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe .
he 's not proposing marriage , there 's no way i 'm buying one word of th ...
then why are you compulsively eating ? if you 're not hysterical ?
yes . some nut who wanted to kill him . how is your father ?
that 's what i was going to ask you . he 's disappeared !
what do you want me to say ? that i thought i 'd done a great job but it all turned to shit ? that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did ?
yeah , tell me . tell me all of it .
john , i 'm twenty-six years old i did n't run away from home .
i know , bob . you were on a secret mission .
before making any decisions , i think i should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange , unreasoning attitudes .
under the circumstances i 'm afraid that will be impossible .
naw , man , it ai n't white boy day .
shit , man , you done fucked up again . next time you bogart your way into a nigger 's crib , an ' get all his face , make sure you do it on white boy day .
it 's in an office ; i have just left it in the office .
well , you had better go and get it from the office . that 's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday . now chop-fuckin'-chop .
so ? is n't the president jumping on your bandwagon ?
what he did was light the bandwagon on fire . because he knows what i know -- that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm 's way .
you shot the leopard . we know that . you killed consuelo . you killed clo clo . then tonight --
i did n't do anything . she screamed . something frightened her .
it looks done . i 'll take it the way it is .
here 's your steak . you ca n't wait for it to be done . here .
please , we just want to take a short ride . a friend of mine has never seen the casbah .
i 'm sorry . tomorrow . tonight is out of the question .
i 'm going to the war . the real war . hitler 's taken europe . the brits are hanging on by their fingernails , and if they lose , there 'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine . and not just there , but here .
but you 're in the u.s. army , how could you --
-- because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he did n't --
and your brother tom is a psychology professor and is married to ... betsy --
it 's not just art , it 's history . something you americans do n't care about -- because you have n't got any .
that 's because we live in the future . which is what 's on my mind .
wait , are you saying that i do n't appreciate ?
i 'm saying he asked me out for coffee , like a real date , when was the last time you did that ?
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place .
it 's public record . if the public cares enough to read it .
oh , several . lucretia borgia , joseph mengele , franklin pangborn ... are any of those names familiar ?
if i say 'no ' does that make me a bad person ?
it 's dr. st. luc , mr spergazzi . let me speak to the nurse , please .
oh , but the nurse , she went away . i think she must go to look for you .
why do n't you stay at larry 's house ? there 's plenty of room .
yeah , there 's room . and there 's julia .
glad `` nothing '' could take you away from your work .
ben , i do n't know if this thing 'll change us back or make us worse . i need you to be patient for a little while longe --
help me ! i do n't want to die !
you 're not gon na die . grab me with your other hand !
hiya , marty . well , it 's old home week .
do me a favor , will you , george ?
but that would make me a slut . would n't it ?
cecile , everybody does it . it 's just that nobody talks about it .
i want you to help me take my revenge .
michael , anything . what is it i can do for you ?
you cut her . you raped her . you watched !
hey , i got my rocks off , so fuck you in the ass , man .
i guess you could say we 're entopologists of a sort .
i do n't think so . i mean , him , he could be a scientist , maybe . but you ... exterminator , i 'd understand . but entopolgist ? no way .
sara , my arm . i 'm stuck , honey .
i guess you 're going to have to chew it off then .
but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence ?
i put myself in his stories . i play the parts . each strumpet , each murderess .
oh-h , mrs. hillyer , i ... i ca n't think . i ... i 'm not really sure .
rose , really , you should n't act like that .
we ca n't just stop looking . eric and dr. grant are out there somewhere .
i want to find them too , but we ca n't do a bit of good right now . for every scary thing we saw in the daylight , i 'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night . am i right ?
what 's all the fuss about ? is he in hiding ?
you know as much about it as i do . i have n't seen him in three months .
dude , please ! . . . is this your homework , larry ?
just ask him if he -- ask him about the car , man !
you mean this sign ? the one that says `` no coloreds allowed . '' that 's a good question . ray , how come we missed the sign ?
look , ma'am , we 've been driving all day . we 'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we 'll be on our way .
what i do n't understand is how you got here .
i assure you , there 's nothing mysterious involved .
you 're not from around here , are you ?
why you say that ? just because i help a lady with her package ?
i 'm afraid that 's not true . will you want me to stay on till monday ?
no . no thank you , doctor . you go home .
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it 's not even worthy of a response . i guess i 'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life .
but you do n't know yet , so your negativity 's a bit premature , would n't you say ?
god , i am starving , but i ca n't eat this ...
that 's more food than these people eat in a week . they 're starving , too ...
okay ... sure ... it 's just that , with my old partner , you know ...
i just do n't think we should have that sort of relationship . we 'd start quarreling over insignificant things .
sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound . ever notice , lila ?
sam . he said an hour . or less .
actually , i already work for you . or did . your arboreal preservation project in south america .
we cut our support . a conflict of ideologies . dr. woodrue was a lunatic .
white house switchboard . how may i direct your call .
okay listen , listen carefully . this is an emergency call from air force one . who 's there ? is the vice- president there ?
madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts . she 's being so considerate .
i 'm sorry she 's not feeling well enough to receive you today .
jeanne ... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers .
but ... where is dunois ... where are the men the king promised me ?
it 's not . you 're money . any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you .
it 's just that i 've been out of the game so long . trent , i was with her for six years . that 's before aids . i 'm scared . i do n't know how to talk to them , i do n't know ...
you really ought to look at this , linda . there 's a drawing on every page ... and all these quizzes . it 's like school .
why do n't you put your mother 's secret book back ?
mom , you know i had to do it . i just did it a little too late .
you sure you 're ok teddy ? you 're not bowling are you ?
everyone concerned thought ... if they could get her to give back the money ... they could avoid involving her with the police .
explains the private detective . he traced her to the bates place . what 'd he exactly say when he called you ?
what 're we going to do ? ! where 're we going ? !
the airport ... no , look out , short round ! left , left !
perhaps you 'd rather discuss it personally with the president --
this is not a personal matter , mr. harley . it concerns all the people on your planet .
she 's probably smash you in the fucking face .
i do n't know about that . she was pretty into it . but i was n't gon na try . the whole thing is , you just got ta take it slow . show 'em some respect .
i beg you . you ca n't do this to me .
i had three other offers . i only signed on to this picture out of ... loyalty .
no , sweetheart , it 's a stag party . does stay home .
i 'm not talking about does . i 'm talking about hookers .
no do n't sit here and feed us some shit .
you got caught . it 's all fun and fuckin ' games till you get caught . but now we gotcha . ok , mr. elliot actor , you 've just made the big time -
what do we have here ? a lovely new supply of venom . i 'll just take this to my laboratory for further study .
what exactly are you working on in there ? what are those screams ?
it 's a pleasure to meet you , mother . but i 'm an ape like dad was ... and i have to go back into the woods now ... forever .
yes , i suppose so . i suppose i knew that was going to be what you would say . it 's good to see you again though .
and here is our illustrious court composer , herr salieri .
finally ! such an immense joy . diletto straordinario !
if junior finds us , he 'll kill us both .
i killed him once , i 'll just have to kill him again .
oh , i 'm sorry . does my line of work make you uncomfortable , precious ?
no . just that you need to hurt me with it . i 've been where you 've been .
-- what 're you doing ? -- jason , please , tell me what 's happening !
open it -- -- do it -- what 's he got in there ?
what do you want to live in a black neighborhood for ? motherfuck gentrification .
i 'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases .
i 'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world . surely you would agree --
i am not concerned , mr. harley , with the internal affairs of your planet . i consider that to be your business -- not mine .
my god ... it 's true . the penguin- man of the sewers ... please , do n't h --
quiet , max . what do you think , this is a conversation ?
these stories are not going to get you school certificate ! you do n't seriously think anyone 's going to publish them ?
what do you know ? you would n't know the first thing about writing . you 're the most ignorant person i 've ever met !
that 's what i 've been tellin ' ya . the guy was like a mad dog . so the cops are n't looking for me ?
naw , until they hear something better they 'll assume drexl and blue lou had a falling out . so , once you leave twon , i would n't worry about it .
jesse . what are you thinking ? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county !
i had to see you . i 'm getting married .
here 's the deal . you work without the chains , without the bit -- without the shivs . you help us get off this rock ... .
for what ? the honor of goin ' back to some asshole of a cell ?
so when do i meet up with the husband and give him the look ?
it 's not that simple . you have to be careful . there 's another guy that comes along , a hard-on you owe some money to . a mob guy . wants to take you out anyway , on account of a past situation .
i just believe in giving credit where credit is due . and i believe that i 'm the impetus behind your failure to wed .
if i 'm so nuts about you , then why am i having sex with an asian design major ?
he does n't know you . could n't you change ?
the cops were all over my house . they 'll kill me for sure .
a real palace . she rattles around alone in that thing --
she 's done well for herself -- on her own and all --
with love 's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls ; for stony limits can not hold love out , and what love can do that dares love attempt ; therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me .
if they do see thee , they will murder thee .
time is of no importance , mr. president . only life is important .
that 's exactly what we are going to try and do : protect the lives of some billion of our fellow citizens ! general ? you may fire when ready .
start acting like you 're worthy of this mission ... here . whatever you do , do n't dare drop it .
nay , sire , i 'll cling to it as to life itself ...
jesus , mary , you got ta hear this -- some cop 's staking out this broad 's apartment .
no time , magda , my show 's starting .
yep . it 's going to be a law . i broke up with charlie last night .
that 's terrific . you did it . you really changed the course of your destiny .
it 's all right for you , you could n't get a pen in your foot , you swine .
come on , shake , we 'll leave 'em to their penmanship .
maude , this < u > man < /u > wrote this < u > play < /u > !
that a fact . now , is it a good play ?
the answer is yes . now what 's the question ?
there 's been a lot of confusion in the media about who i am and what i 'm up to and all that . i 'd like to set the record straight . with your help .
why do n't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much ?
why do n't i just drag you off ? all right -- i will . right after we get the blood tests .
i 've heard of you , too . you were in with bargamian .
and you were with cougar . he was my roommate in flight school .
ray . did you mean that , what you said before , or were you just being a gentleman ?
abby , i like you , but it 's no point starting anything now .
you 're going to have to stop this disturbance or i shall arrest you .
that 's what i want you to do , you moron !
jesus , reiben , think of the poor bastard 's mother .
hey , i got a mother . jackson , you got a mother ?
and his soul black as the ace of spades .
he went on a senseless crime spree , killed a cop during a bank robbery , got caught and judged insane . the professor told us they threw away the key .
couple ? no , you got it wrong , there 's no couple here . just two single police officers working a very dangerous case .
yes . we have lots of big men chasing us .
nitro-cellulose . what is that , some kind of explosive ?
industrial wood oil . separately , any one of these things could lead in several directions , but together ...
keep it . go wild . have a party .
why 'd you do that ? do n't tell me you 're a gentleman , max . i thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics ...
pain by nerve induction ... a human can resist any pain . our test is crisis and observation .
i see the truth of it . -- reverend mother could he be the one ? ... maybe ... but will he be ours to control ? you know when people speak the truth ?
mr. president , how the hell did you get on board ?
i never left . where 's my wife and daughter ?
i want to be john malkovich . tomorrow morning . plus i 'd like to meet this partner of yours .
well , you know we 're going to be very busy tomorrow . i 'll tell you what . let 's do it tonight . right now .
masseria 's scared . he might make our deal .
we ca n't sell out to those guys . they ai n't businessmen !
yeah , i liked her in that movie about tv ...
< i > network < /i > . yeah , she was good .
cheer up , you lost your prince , but dinner 's on the way .
i 've never been so hungry in my life ...
we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships . but it does n't get us any closer to removing those missiles .
have to hope it 's a signal that he 'll back down on the real issue too .
well , you see , that 's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
wait a minute . what are you talking about ?
brain damage could have been ... it did n't necessarily take nine minutes , it could have been caused in two ...
wait , wait , wait , you 're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes ... ?
she 's fine . well , actually we 've broken up . it 's all over .
no . that 's terrible , charles . what happened ?
they couldnt climb up , so they were trying to get us to come down .
they set a trap they actually set a trap .
i am going to do nothing about it . < u > you < /u > are going to sit in the closet .
the < u > closet < /u > ? ! have you lost all sense of reality ?
that 's what we 're here to find out .
if it happened to him , then it could ...
or , i dissolve into an angry , hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again , which is probably what would really happen .
i just do n't want natalie to ever find out . she deserves better .
no . the pill will change all that . then he would n't have blamed me . we were just too young .
you mean you 'll give a girl a pill and she 'll want to have sex ?
half an hour from now and you 'll be walking out of here all by yourself . mark my words . well , you 've done it to yourself this time , have n't you ?
am i dead , louis ? am i dead ?
i ca n't believe we had to give them the damn tape .
yeah , me neither . it was one of my favorites . me and faith in a hot tub on my birthday . i 'm going to really miss it .
he thought she was great , mr. thompson . he really believed that . he put all his ambition on that girl . after she came along , he never really cared for himself like he used to . oh , i do n't blame susie -
well , then , how could he write that roast ? the notices in the kane papers were always very kind to her .
we 're hoping it 's only a temporary problem , admiral ...
see that it is . take me over , please .
oh , what ? i offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it 's `` sexual harassment ... ''
can i be frank , frank ? your entire existence is sexual harassment . i accept there 's not much you can do about it .
well ... the manager , mr. heem , would like to meet him . nothing unusual . mr. heem likes to meet all our large accounts ... put them on a personal basis ... just a chat and a handshake , you understand .
of course . but if i were you , i 'd leave the doctor alone until after he 's eaten breakfast . he 's a very crude man .
do you have real iced coffee , or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes ?
everything is real in here , honey . as real as the color of my hair .
he did n't tell me you was a fuck- up , either . you played the big con since then .
no , i lammed it around for a while while things cooled off . philly , denver , baltimore , nuthin ' towns .
now i know that 's been my problem since i was a kid . but it only caught up to me last night .
you 've been drawn to other males ? since you were a kid ?
how about this one ? we did n't hit this one .
yeah , it 's frass canyon . it 's a joke .
that 's the big tall one , the fellow with the moustache .
no , that 's my other brother , freddie . my other brother freddie , he 's been married four years already . he lives down on webb avenue . the one who got married sunday , that was my little brother , nickie .
with all due respect , detective , you ca n't go blaming every brutal murder in illinois on michael meyers .
pamela whittington was a long time associate of dr. loomis . her home office was ransacked . it was chock full of loomis ' files on meyers . it 'd say that makes meyers a suspect , would n't you ?
it 's a computer comany ... it 's a computer company , < u > bazoomer < /u > - < u > com < /u > ?
`` bazoomer < u > dot < /u > com . ''
did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated ?
no . he 's either very smart or very stupid .
gee , i used every frame of film we shot . maybe they wo n't notice .
they 'll notice . look , why do n't you let me take over from here ? i can do a few tricks : pad it out with more stock footage , add establishing shots ...
so , it will just take you a little longer to get over it .
but i think we should talk about it . or are you fully convinced that we too wo n't understand each other ?
you 're unemployed , alfie . boss is dead . her plan is over .
my plan is just beginning . i 'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers , but i 'm afraid the birth of the new british empire can have no witnesses !

how am i going to conduct an interview if i ca n't ask him any questions ?
it 's the best you 're gon na get . i 'm sorry .

and here i thought `` anarchy '' was just something cool to put on a tshirt .
harry , what 're you doing ? you 're supposed to be in the hospital .

: the night in the woods with his father and sounder . the shouting and laughter after the baseball game --

i got ta talk to him as soon as i can .
he says he 's too hot . he does n't even know i came here today . it 's like he 's crazy . jimmy .
so , there are rules . things you do and things you do n't do .
i was just telling the woman how i feel , for god 's sake .
that 's not patricide . patricide is when you gun down your old man .
all right . `` fratricide '' . minor technical detail .
excuse me , general , but may i ask how do you feel ?
no one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than i. but if victory is remote and there 's any hope for a negotiated peace , we must keep this army intact .
how can you just give up like that ? you had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything . do n't you want more ? to move out of mom and dad 's ? pay your own bills ?
oh yay ! and then i could be as happy as you !
and if you 've got cold feet honey , ill take over for you . that red dress of yours fits just perfect on me .

with what ? he does n't have a weapon .
he 's a soldier . he does n't need a weapon . he 's got rocks . he 's got bare hands .
i told you , i do n't play well with others .
turn on your laptop . set it to receive a file .
i know you need to please lisa . an ass like that is hard to find . good bodyguards are even harder .
i know ! i just had to let one go because i could n't afford him !
it 's okay . these are police . < u > what < /u > do you want ?
i want d.a . bureau men to tail dudley smith twenty-four hours a day ; i want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone ; i want authorization to check his bank records and i want it all in an hour .
buddy , you would n't tell nobody , would you ?
do n't worry , rose , i wo n't tell a soul .
listen very carefully , i 'm telling the truth ... this is the game . this was all the game .
bullshit . they killed him . feingold , fisher , whoever ... they shot him ...
i think that either you 're going to give them to him or he 's going to make you give them to him .
make me ? how ? you think he 's going to torture me ?
do n't take no tone of voice with me , homes .
what is this shit you 're talking all of a sudden ? you 're a bus driver , `` homes , '' you live in flatbush , so please do n't start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too ,
i wanted you to know -- now -- i 'm very proud .
tell them the gear is down and we 're ready to land .
harry , would you like to share with the rest of us what 's so funny ?
you would n't get it . just a private joke between best friends .
i did n't say that , sid . but you know there were rumors . your dad was always out of town on business . maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman .
if they were having an affair how come that cotton could n't prove it in court ?
if we get him , i 'll be happy enough .
no . face it now . stop thinking it 's good guys against bad guys .
i 'm so sorry ... i ... i could n't help it . you know i did n't mean to ... to do any of that .
i know . the important thing is that it stop .
all right . `` fratricide '' . minor technical detail .
wrong . fratricide is when you gun down your brother . you 're out . my turn .
always nice to meet one of her majesty 's fellow subjects ... especially one with such distinguished friends .
you might say i 've always been one of mr. valentin 's biggest followers .
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing .
your wife , sir ? has she gone away ?
yah , you said you 'd have a think about it . i understand it 's a lot of money -
a heck of a lot . what 'd you say you were gon na put there ?

mordechai , santa claus has been rubbed out by his son damian . the man 's a demon . there 's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho santa is capable of .

really ? already ? the summer 's just begun .
what is this , mozart ? what 's the matter with you ?
well . since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services , could you favour me with a little money instead ?
yes mr. lebowski , these unfortunate souls can not love in the true sense of the word . our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these .
listen , maude , i 'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho , but i do n't see what it has to do with -- do you have any kalhua ?
samuel ramos . owns one of the plants in juarez . the jap car industry is in the toilet . he 's trying to persuade ford to partner with him . i think he 's in trouble . he asked me if i knew anyone he could trust .
oh , now you think i can be trusted .
you 're a real tough guy when the ladies are around , are n't you , ace ?
i do n't see any ladies here . except maybe you .
is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone ?
he was thinking of you , marge -- he asked me to deliver this .
but what if we ca n't ever find where we came from ? !
then you 'll have to make your own home . lots of people do .
if it 's alright , i 'm gon na pick up the rest of my gear .
you know where everything is ... i 'm late for my shift .
boy , ai n't you somethin ' else . talkin ' back and everything . it kinda makes me horny when you talk back .
frank , why do n't you go off and play in your room if doyle 's gon na talk nasty .
i do n't even know her . all i know is she likes snapple .
no , not her . shari . go over there and talk to her
it 'll come for the plane . it 's attracted to metal . the electro- magnetic impulse ... .
will you get the bloody hell out of here ... .
i . . . nothing . i just stubbed my toe on a rock . hurt like hell . . . that 's all .
i got the money all packed . i put the jeep in the garage . figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away . might buy us some time .
you want me to leave ? why ? because somebody is telling it like it is ? somebody 's giving these fine people a wake-up call ? !
you 're loitering in here , and causing a disturbance .
reporters , jerry . they been callin ' all night .
just be friendly and say `` no comment . ''
but i do work , so if you do n't mind --
no , look . i do mind . the dude minds . this will not stand , ya know , this will not stand , man . i mean , if your wife owes --
how horrible . we 'll be fine . you 'll be fine . stay here with me -- we 'll go for a drive , have some drinks , make happy plans .
no . they 're firing even more people than they said . some will want to talk . it could help .
it 's like very positive , and i feel a real special feeling , because you really --
and i have a special feeling too , because i do . it 's special .
we 're not yet open for business , i 'm afraid .
shame . i was recommended . by a friend .
i am ... you must know something about him ... .
he gambles ... he likes a good time ... i see him around ... .
... and boy does it hurt when they ask .
i do n't even tell them about anything i 'm close on anymore ...
is that the ransom file ? thanks . do n't wear that outfit again .
ummm ... what ? i did n't hear you .
you might see her . she writes your daddy , and she and that doctor came to see him , did n't they ? i wish you 'd tell her something ... i never could write letters .
what do you want me to tell her , dave ?
no ! you 're one of them . of course , it makes perfect sense !
no , it does n't ! those keys were put there . i did n't even know ...
give me your best shot , you flat assed mama 's boy .
do n't be talking about my mama . or my ass !
[ yeah , i 've got to get used to the routes . i -- it wo n't happen again . ]
[ no offense , but i 'm sorry that your profession needs to exist . ]
i 'm the librarian . i 've always been the librarian .
i know you -- you 're an automaton of some sort that --
because i made a vow . never to interfere in the destiny of your planet .
but what good is a vow if everything gets blown away ? what good was my letter ?
but that 's what we 're here to find out , right ?
you do n't tell me my job , and i wo n't tell you about yours , okay ?
nice . always a good idea to show up your instructors . he nods toward jester , glaring at them from his a4 . goose indicates the backseat of the tomcat .
hey , see any controls back there ? and anyway ... we beat the son of a bitch !
it 's okay with me , baby . but how ' you goin ' to like it ?
it 'll be fine when we get done with it .
oh . . . me ? oh , well , i feel funny enough already , with all these kids .

we seen this kind of parachutes before , you know . u.s. army . you got some friends here , jump out with you guys ?
we 're anti-social . we do n't have any friends .
maybe i 'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
oh no . i could n't let it out of my house . you 'll have to finish it here .
you 're a curious man . you 're willing to jeopardize jacqueline 's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity .
you come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally i want to know what kind of danger . i want to know where she is .
which was n't too hard , the guy was a real squid .
so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin ' . and , krinkle , you ai n't gon na fuckin ' believe it .
i wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the army medical corps .
sister , if i knew the answer to that i sure as hell would n't be here .
but i would need at least three minutes on the bridge .
if we could lure him away from the bridge ...
what about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight ? have they all arrived ?
i talked to most of them this morning ... they were all very curious about the meeting .
let 's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days .
amen to that . it 's been a crazy day , has n't it ? !
pffft ! absolute nonsense . the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations , my dear mr. garrison - grimy young hoodlums who 'll say and do anything . as you well know .
... in the course of that night , mr. o'keefe said a man named david ferrie stopped by the house ... along with another young man ...
you can not ! not for the queen herself !
what will you have me do ? marry you instead ?
i suspected , but you were the one low contacted . that 's why i brought you back here .
what did you think of the suspect zero theory ?
you do n't tell me , i know my rights , just come right in , you ca n't --
do n't test me , you wan na talk about what the law book says , we can do that , push me far enough and i 'll take you to jail -- now calm down .
... since i used to take you to the proms ?
that 's right . not since then not since i got married .
[ you 're a liar . pinta 's dead . ]
[ i 'm a businessman . a dead girl is worth nothing . she is alive . ]
i hope you did n't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote freud .
as always , your keen powers of perception astound me . and you 're right . i 've come to celebrate . after thirty-two years as psychiatric administrator , guess who has been named smith 's groves new chief of staff .
she did n't take it from you , did she ?
that little girl ? ha . now go on , get me some tools .
your timing is excellent , mr. scott . you 've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home . how much refit time till we can take her out again ?
eight weeks , sir . but you do n't have eight weeks so i 'll do it for ya in two .
he 's working round the clock . but the data needs to be tested , analyzed before --
same old reed . all analysis , no action . was n't that the problem with you two ?
when i get home i shall probably be knighted for it .
knighted ! you do n't say . do you mind if i take a look at it ?
well , i do n't know if that 's ethical . you see , all statements are supposed to come from me .
we 'll have to satisfy them . what would you say to giving them a joint interview ? i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects .
[ hello daniel . i 've got your family and i want to negotiate . ]
[ mr. creasy . what do you want ? ]
filled ? that 's impossible ! they have n't even seen my work . i need this post . please , ca n't you help me ? please !
my dear mozart , there is no one in the world i would rather help , but now it is too late .
at least we get time and a half . that 's in the contract .
fuck double pay , man ! i want out of here !
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal .
i do n't question the legality of what you do . it 's your morality that makes me sick . i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you .
see , men always do this . `` quiet down , honey . chill out . take a valium '' . i 'm not a fucking idiot , nick ! i did not imagine it ! ! !

oh , did he ? what did he say ?
i owe you for the rent . it 's only a car . i can get another .
take it back . till you sell your book .
but she does n't know , about her background . she never heard of carlotta valdes .
knows nothing of a grave out at mission dolores , or an old house an eddy street , or a portrait at the palace of the legion of honor ?
you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death ?
pardon me , doctor , i am hearing many calls of distress .
jeez , louise , that was n't very nice .
ca n't you tell when somebody 's hittin ' on you ?
when i was a kid i identified with that kid , down there alone in that pipe ... a hundred feet down -- does n't know if they 're going to save him .
what do you mean -- when you were a kid ?
how far is baker ? i was hoping to stop there for lunch .

my friend li mu bai . he 's given it to sir te as a gift .
li mu bai ! the famous warrior ? why would he give his sword to sir te ?
he 's not a cop . a cop would n't have kneed me .
he was following us -- but he 's not a policeman .
you know , when you gave him a beatin ' .
nothin ' . salvy was out of line . he was drunk or somethin ' , i dunno . anyway , the windup was i gave him a beatin ' . tommy called me down , and we straightened it out . it 's all forgotten about .

yeah ? well , when i get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo , i 'll --
i 'm telling you , doug , your brain wo n't know the difference . guaranteed , or your money back .
what about the guy you lobotomized ... did he get a refund ?
out of the question . you 'd miss the gymnastics trials . you 've been training for that for a year .
i do n't care about the trials , i want to be with you . i could be your research assistant , like i was in austin .
latest casualty ? ernest harriman . you heard of him ?
sure . one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago .
for the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours . the bureau , local law enforcement and the texas rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare seth and richard gecko .
agent chase , does it appear that they are heading for mexico .
there was a prince , who was dying , and he was carried up the tower at pisa so he could die with a view of the tuscan hills . am i that prince ? hana laughs .
because you 're leaning ? no , you 're just on an angle . you 're too heavy !
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months . it seems impossible , but in light of the transmission ... i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now .
skipper , do we get hazard pay for this ?
happy birthday , kid . you want another coke ?

all we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
look , buddy-boy -- if there was n't a lady present , i 'd clobber you .
that 's what he says . i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now .
good . you 've got nothing to worry about . soon as the report comes in , you 'll be released . and listen , do n't talk so loud . take it easy . coast a little .
i 'm not sure i got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
what 's wrong with you , david ? all you have to do is say , excuse me , i 've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i 'd really like some action from you before the end of the world . i 'll go .
i came to see you , charles , about your - about the enquirer 's campaign against the metropolitan transfer company .
wo n't you step into my office , mr. thatcher ?
this is the best part , sid . billy 's got it all figured out . why do you think we kept your father alive so long ? why did we save you for last ?
you know what time it is , sid ? it 's after midnight . it 's your mother 's anniversary . we killed her exactly one year ago today .
you have to believe me . i did it with the best intentions .
some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions . you rushed in with no thought to the consequences , to yourself or anyone else . you 're no better than the people who built this place .
sheriff , how many batteries and what size did you find on < u > defendant 's < /u > boat ?
two d-6 's . that 's the kind his well was fitted for .
i 'm tired , paul . so tired . i have to rest a while .
do n't you die on me ! ! this is baby suggs quilt . is that what you planning ! ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about . who told you that ?
no one had to tell me . he 's starring in the local play .
not once . what 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ? it 's really more fun .
three cheers for betty schaefer ! i will now kiss that nose of yours .
with all due respect , dear , that 's bull . you dance rings around me with your new technology . you 've left me in the dust .
your work is highly relevant . what about your display on primitive pharmacology ? cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit .
you seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand ! narcissus , the republic is dead . you think those senators could govern ? for the last hundred and fifty years they 've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of imperial asses !
then give the empire back to the people ... the children who will grow up to become senators ...
damn ! that must be about as far north as you can get .
pretty near . what do you know about the outfit we 're going to ?
no , i was with her yesterday . i want you to take eric and go to our parents house . i want you to do it right now .
i went to the grocery store . my atm and credit cards did n't work . i could n't buy food .
do n't say that . do n't you < u > dare < /u > say that .. < u > i believe you < /u > ..
i know you 're trying to help me , but you do n't understand .
glands . you 're supposed to be happy when you die . call me comical again .
you 're a clown . you 're a clown who kills -- but you 're a clown .
pin your diapers on , lebowski . jackie treehorn wants to see you .
and we know which lebowski you are , lebowski .
you 've kept up your end of the bargain , i 'll do the same . but you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .
but i hate cops , remember ? except for her .
i can tell she 's not a killer . you just do n't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation .
nah , man , i 'm just saying , you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive .
we ? what the fuck we ? you said you just wanted to come along --
my point , dude , is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million . am i wrong ?
maybe we should just call it a day , lou . go home . while we 're still a little behind . we got two people killed , maybe more we never thought about .
you never got anyone killed , boss . their actions killed them years before . if we stopped now , it 'd be even more wrong .
no . no man . that 's ... that 's ... you do n't know what you 're talking about . that 's bullshit . i know these guys . i mean , thanks for your concern , but that just ai n't the thing of it .
do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in .
it has occurred to me on several occasions . but i believe this may be the appropriate time .
wait a minute . i thought you 've always been afraid it would overload your neural net .
humpf -- so i was wrong this time . but by god , i was n't wrong when i mailed you my diary . you obviously got it .
i got it and i used it . we found the entrance to the catacombs .
our asses gon na be in a sling if we get caught .
and if we do n't , they 're gon na be riding high in a brand new kenworth .

this trucker ? met a girl in a bar one night , she did n't know his situation . he 's drunk , she 's drunk , they get to mackin ' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it . his tongue . sucks it right down .
my guy would walk into a room , set off the goddamn sprinklers .
last time anybody saw this woman she was alive . you seem to certain she 's dead .
i saw her drowning inside the car , detective .
now , icky , i do n't need you winding yourself up . i need you focused and in control .
but , poppy , you do n't know what this means --
it 's the most beautiful place in the universe .
sounds o.k . to me . let 's go .
there are reasons for the way we do things here .

how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with ?
how about this child ? you expect *her* to be responsible ?
objection , your honor . the answer is , to be generous , very vague .
can you recall any particular incident that relates to mr. kramer 's care of his child ?
oh yeah . it 's herschel gordon lewis . he 's the ultimate master of horror .
please . dario argento is the ultimate master of horror .
i 'll be out on gateway and i doubt i 'll be back before the troopers get here .
maybe you ought to wait here till they do .
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy .
all right . let 's cool the negative vibes . these things can sense them .
leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell jimmy . but you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered . do you realize what leo could have told jimmy ? ! do you ? !
i took him out before he got the chance . he did n't say nothin ' about tashka sha . and now his spirit is in the dirt . forever .
that 's it ? no number , or instructions ?
nothing . the bio buster ? i do n't get it ...
i 'd say that about sums it up , exposition .
not quite , actually . vanessa , i have something for you .
oh , that 's nice . so the doctor was wrong , was n't he ?

we were a rebound , and we lasted six years .

i do n't think evan gets to be in it --

we 're friends , harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid congressman , do n't we ?
why does everything you say sound like a threat ?
its horrors , perhaps ! its darkest nightmares ! and to what end ? nothing but your own morbid gratification --
morbid gratification ? no ! i write what i 've seen ; the endless procession to the chopping block . we 're all lined up at the guillotine , waiting for the crunch of the blade . rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet , abbe .
you know one around here ? somebody you trust ?
no ... i thought i 'd take you to the hospital .

of course . and now i have to get back to the news . send up some ice .

i hear you and mills were high school sweethearts .
high school and college , yes . pretty hokey , huh ? i knew on our first date this was the man i was going to marry . god ... he was the funniest man i 'd ever met .

it has been said , my friend , that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means .
i was wrong . i admit it . my bad , okay ? now let 's just go back to the ship .
i dunno . nice breeze , wide open spaces -- you know , i 'm startin ' to enjoy myself out here .
there ai n't no possums in this woods tonight , daddy .
looks that way , son . guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there 's one left out here -- we got ta find him .
if anyone ever spoke to me , the way i heard ... the way she spoke to you , i do n't think i could ever laugh again .
sometimes when she talks that way to me i 'd like to ... curse her out and leave her forever ! or at least , defy her . but i could n't . she 's ill .
lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing . like me -- but on a grander scale of failure .

there 's a short letter i left you all , just some ... sentimental nonsense ... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred ... i 'd just as soon you delete it ...
fat chance . i 'll post it on every monitor on the ship ...
of course that does n't jibe with what we found . this was an angry killing .
who knows with these `` deficients '' ? his profile indicates a proclivity for violence .
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon . i was going to clerk for the supreme court .
i was going to play golf . you were going to have asian girlfriends .
captain , force the sub to the surface for inspection .
mr. president ! we 're receiving reports that the ships are stopping !
i do n't mean to belittle you , but we 've been through this before . satan is not what you think he is . satan is not some creature .
you were n't there . give me time to get some proof .
... first time in my life i 'll be a voice with a body . do you know what that means ? what this could lead to ?
jack , it 's a sitcom -- you 're not defining pi .
yeah , and i was thinking , sooze , you could do the cover .
you do not want me to do your cover .
land ! are you crazy ? i 'm no amishman and i 'm no farmer ! i 'm a cop . that 's what i know and that 's what i do !
what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven !
fuck , man . too early in the morning for that , you know what i mean ?
she 's a kid , jack . i do n't even look at that stuff anymore .
that 's why you 're having them . your spells .
spells ? jesus , james , you make it sound like we 're in a tennessee williams play . i do n't have spells .
let 's see ... that you can read ancient sanskrit without having to sound out the words . and that other dealers and archeologists do n't like you much .
those wimps . it 's because i use * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike . i told you to move those crates an hour ago . come on guys , let 's get going .
besides , i do n't even know if i want to write anymore .
what , you 're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor 's daughter ?
sorry , ethan . i do n't quite know where to begin . any suggestions ?
you 'd like me to conduct my own debriefing .

the stamp market , of course -- it is here every thursday afternoon . this is where jean-louis trades his --
good lord ! the stamps ! where is he ? sylvie -- we 've got to find him !
hey , look -- we 've known kristin since ... since she was conceived in that cabin up in big bear . remember ? you and edie banged the wall so hard , me and carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week ...
goddammit , tug -- i want to see kristin get married , okay ? but --
not in this case , my dear . take a look . that 's not gainsborough 's blue boy up there . he 's vigo !
i do n't care who he is . he 's not taking my baby .
but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone ?
they say we must pray to their evil god . we say we will not .
i know a little bit about human nature and what i 've seen only confirms that .
it 's a trap . there was no way we were gon na get away with that gold . nobody ever does . it 's just the bait . this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out .

yeah , yeah . okay . give me the roast and watch your step . i 'll come back for the radio .
i was as good a son to him as you or mike .

he wants to kill you ... and me ... and everyone on this ship .
but we do have a lack of notaries . you should contact my administration .
don bobadilla is already a judge , my dear don cristobal .
he was incredible . this guy is fearless . he has no fear .
that 's one - way of looking at it . you might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain ' .
you said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them . do n't you remember ?
that 's the thing . i have this condition .
what about angelina tyler ? she was there too .
police are still searching through the debris . could be days before we find her . . . that is , if she 's even there .

the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe ...

we assaulted a federal agent . we killed him .

mr. levene , i think we have to talk .
i 'm going to the chinks . you 're done , come down , we 're going to smoke a cigarette .

riot ? i do n't see no riot . who 're you ?
stay with us , then , dorothy . we all love you . we do n't want you to go .
oh , that 's very kind of you -- but this could never be like kansas . auntie em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now . oh , scarecrow , what am i going to do ?
what kind of talk is that ? so you got a little over- emotional -- but you 're fine now .
my head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum . what time is it ?
it 's a small post and they 're phasing it out in two years , but i moved up in rank and -- well , a command is a command .
otis went on like you were that guy who won the gulf war . colin whatsit .
nobody wants war . i 'd just like to keep the threat alive .
a mind is a terrible thing to waste , lex luthor . and you 've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity . i 'm taking you in .
i ca n't eat a steak . if i eat a steak , i 'm gon na have trouble making the weigh-in .
so eat just a little . you got ta eat something .
please . it does n't have to be now . maybe we can make a date to sit down , i did n't mean to walk in on you like this --
why are you here , why are you doing this ? coming in here -- you wan na call me a whore ?
no . and he ai n't been eating so good , either . he 's got an empty stomach and it 's gone to his head .
but , joe - three weeks in florida ! we could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
oh -- well -- you 're not starting out very well .
oh , i 'll try ! really , i will .
for one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge , the tires were all intact , from what we could tell , nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either . like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally .
it should all in the report . i told you guys everything . she was giving birth in the fucking car . she grabbed the wheel and i lost control .
we are at least six men short , and those we have will be overparted , ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews . my romeo has let me down . i see disaster .
we are at least four acts short , will , if you are looking for disaster .
well , it 's just good to hear from you . what 's up , son ?
it 's not really working out for me here , dad . i was thinking ... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home .
you be careful to . i 'm going to miss you .
shall we go away for a couple of days ?
as you can see , security 's pretty tight in this section . nobody gets past elmer here . is n't that right ?
not in one piece anyway . i see mrs whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother . i 'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her . the vice president here will vouch for that .
i -- i do n't know what to say . i know he 's under a cloud , but there 's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession .
you still never know what 's going on in anyone 's mind ...
oh , yeah ? well , if you had n't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
do n't talk to me about importance . because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy .
no , i like the bag . it would be good for the job tonight .
it belongs to vincent bastaldi . he left it last time he was here . i 'm sure he would n't mind if you used it .
you 're saying there 's an electrical storm in my head ?
that 's as good a way as any to describe it . i 've seen far worse cases . you might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane .
i suppose so , but - i 'm not afraid of the story . you ca n't tell me that the voters of this state -
i 'm not interested in the voters of this state right now . i am interested in - well , junior , for one thing .
well -- here 's how it is ... tom sharp , eli higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it . what you think about it ?
i do n't know -- do n't seem much of an idea to me .
you know that super bowl party ? they changed the date . it 's on < u > tonight < /u > , eight-thirty .
did n't you tell me one-time calls are n't monitored ?
it 's the only pose i have left . i 'm sunk . broke . i do n't even have my hotel bill .
i seem to recognize this routine . first the kiss then the touch . oh , what 's the use . you 're you .
wade , you 're done . let me have the shop keys .
you two , do n't you get it ? he 's using you . you 're his slaves . jesus christ , jack , do n't you see that ?
that wo n't make any difference . we just ca n't live together . and you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo janet .
what are you talking about ? who 's janet ?
you saved my life , monkeybone . i never would 've made it without you .
move it . we got exactly five minutes left .
i 'm not givin ' it up jus ' yet ...
c'mon , i say we bounce now , kick it for a lil ' bit , play some craps . ... maybe spend the night ?
excuse me , may i please use your phone ?
bill , why do n't you ask her ... she 's your special friend .
yup . he was jeriko 's manager . bummer , tran ! lost your golden goose . could n't happen to a nicer guy .
but i mean is n't he faith 's new --
well ... i needed to find you . we are gon na have to practice that song .
... okay . cool then . i 'm um , i 'm glad you came by . i mean , really .
when we get the link back , and i send this in , i.c.c . 'll throw a fit .
ah , do n't worry about i.c.c . they 're the least of your problems right now .
that 's okay . i should 've told you i would n't be in uniform .
yeah , it would 've helped . have you got ta cigarette father ?
are you just doin ' this to punish me ?
believe me , the last thing i want is for you to get punished .
tomorrow evening , nine . east river drive and 73rd street .
suppose i meet you there a half hour before .
but that 's a wonderful quality , not a bad quality . have a little patience with her . she 's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard .
you are the one who 's good-hearted . as for rose , let 's hope for the best .
oh , dollface , it was just your passion for me taking hold .
no , dollface , i know what my passion taking hold feels like . i got ta go .
they have security cameras . rooney would see you coming .
did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger ?
no , i do n't really think you 're a freak .
i probably am , but i do n't care . i mean , i was n't that blessed to begin with , and when would i have had time to make any improvements ...
of course , everything 's not as harmonious as it seems . i hope you 've a strong constitution .
my years tending the lepers at st. emilion steeled me for life 's grisliest offerings , doctor .
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate .
i recall distinctly the detonation order . my memory is good on matters like these .
ha ha . that 's very funny , buzz . this is serious ! !
hey , woody ! ? where 'd ya go ?
no sick people in the country , huh ? ... just tell me one thing , rhian . leons story about the boy ? you just took his word for it ?
hed come prepared . he had something besides shiva ... sleeping beauty . the disney film ... well , it looked like the disney film . it was something else . i couldnt watch ...
i 'm small ... and i can make myself smaller still ... small as a bee ! small as dust ... ! want to see me do it ?
we 've no time for tricks this day , honeythorn gump .
norbert -- you come , too . let him go , harold . let him go .
of course he can go -- if he 'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment -- and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree .
are you okay , wade ? what was wrong ? why were you holding everyone up ?
did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw ? he could 've killed somebody .
tee , the beautiful babies do n't work wednesdays midnight to six . this is the skank shift .
what are you talking about ? look at all the honeys .
yeah , real fine . especially all the casualties .
i 'm complimenting you . ca n't you ever just say `` thanks '' ?
not if they do n't catch us , kevin .
we got jobs , man ; we 're working . why even take the chance ?
good morning , mother . did n't i tell you that he 'd be marvelous . everybody thought he was so charming last night .
i was so worried for fear he 'd knock over a vase or something . i must have acted like an idiot . what does it say about the reception last night ?
look , he would n't have any reason to be up there in the first place .
i know that . i realize . but if a certain british doctor never asked `` what 's this fungus ? '' we would n't today have penicillin . correct ?
i think not . i have seen the lady . and if he did not leave her in marseilles , or in oran , he certainly wo n't leave her in casablanca .
maybe he 's not quite as romantic as you are .
too much wealth . too fast . half of gotham zombied-out . a technology that self destructs . he 's protecting more than industrial secrets , alfred .
i shall be near at hand . should you need me . and sir , i know it 's difficult but try and have a good time .
what do you mean 'better in bed . ' you either do it or you do n't .
no there are variables that , like , i might not be good at .
let 's keep going . we 're only an hour from devil 's cauldron .
relax . i just want to ask them how the hunting is .
well you ca n't blame them in a way .
i can take care of myself . you know that .
hang on , get it up , go on , higher .
your 33rd birthday . the transformation will be a perversion of christ 's rising from the dead . townsend discovered it in one of lareaux 's books .
have n't seen him for years . that 's the truth .
you just took a shot at me , asshole . i think you do know where he is .
okay , look -- i think we got off on the wrong foot here --
that 's all you got , lady . two wrong feet . in fucking ugly shoes .
listen , now that i owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus , how about loaning me twenty for cab fare ?
so you can call me `` naive , '' mister laplante .
what are you going to be when you grow up , todd ?
well i 'm going to major in business administration and , i think , minor in communications .
says she can get me in to see this killer .
now that you 're on tv , you 're a magnet for all the wackos out there .
i 'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you 're testing mine .
what is that a threat ? are you fuckin ' threatening me , marcel ?
i do n't know -- i do n't know --
it is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility ...
... but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as i do .
and i 'm good at this . been doing it since i was a kid . but you , i do n't know . somehow you think ...
titus , you 're so stoned , you 'd end up in spain .
that 's why you 'll come with titus , mon .
wait a minute . i do n't let my parents walk on me .
yeah , you just do everything they say ! you 'll be in daddy 's law firm as sure as i 'm standing here . and you 'll be approving loans till you croak .
i do n't want to take any more chances .
let 's just go get guns , i 'd feel better .
heller was buried in agency lore , anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed , hoover blackballed their memory . look at ness .
yeah , but the untouchables took down capone . heller got shot and killed . the bad guys beat him . worse , sparazza walked .
there was an item in the times . i like the title . 'footsteps on the ceiling ' .
let 's get back to this one . have you really seen every performance ? why ? i 'm curious ...
no , girletta , i do n't leave your side .
i 've got my entourage . take a break . please .
i 'm sure the fbi and the police explored that possibility .
no . they never did , really . but that 's what i 'm going to recommend . the next step . unless something --
proud ? any jerk with a gun can kill someone .
quite true . hand-to-hand combat is the true test . did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand ?
commodus , it 's we who are going on the offensive .
the fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they 're most vulnerable .
man , i 'm hungry . i 'm going to call the steward , you want anything ? .
nah , i already ate . why do n't you just go down there ?
have you read it ? ... they 're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them .
yes . i had also thought of going there to talk with them ...
you 're probably right ... '' people think just because you 're beautiful and popular , life is easy and fun . nobody understood i had feelings too . ''
`` i die knowing no one knew the real me . ''
you should have left here years ago , like i did .
it 's not the place . i do n't buy that . trapped in the same town forever . the price she would pay for her teenage lust .
i wo n't eat cheese for no cops , that 's for sure .
it was johnny friendly who killed joey , was n't it ?
no choice . this is going to cost lives any way we go . do nothing , and it could be million of ours . we have to get rid of those missiles .
there 've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them .
hunh-uh . check the bread . he spreads it like the russians are in jersey .
he probably sells insurance . owns a chicken farm in hackensack .
perfectly all right . but if you 'd like to sit --
i 'm fine , jimmy . i can only stay a few minutes .
ah 'm gon na blow you both to hell !
cool , huh huh . hey beavis that 's that dude that 's paying us to do his wife .
that 'll be exactly half past midnight . time for me to fall asleep and find him .
sure , sure , honey . you just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that 's what i 've been saying all along .
what did you do ? bribe one of the guards ?
but you implored me to write ! for curative purposes , to stave off my madness --
shall i go get a cappuccino ? ease the pain .
yes , better get me a half . all i can afford .
do n't be embarrassed , bruce . i heard it , but i just wanted to hear it again . i can stand being spoiled a little . the gentleman i 'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling .
i 'd like to spoil him just once . sure you do n't want me to go in with you ?
you mean you employ mr. baker as your attorney , but you ca n't walk down the street with him ?
i can . but i risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less `` holy '' than mr. baker .
what do i tell my mama when i get home ? i did n't find him and that 's what i wanted to do .
but you did all you could , david . not many little boys could 've gone on such a journey as you did .
there was an accident . drunk driving . they were n't sure .
he was n't drinking . ray fell asleep at the wheel .
major ? ... major ? i 'm colonel `` bat '' guano , battalion .
come in ... come in ... peace on earth ... peace on earth ... yes ...
i do n't want to talk about it . if you really want to know . i lost it . and i 'm not sorry i did . that eye was cursed , auggie , and it never gave me nothing but grief .
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook ?
i know you are , but you have to stop . i could n't tell you before , i did n't know if i should . but you have to stop before you hurt yourself .
i spend three hours a day practicing . i have trainers , i know what i 'm doing .
no . they make me sick . they smell like death ... i had two brothers die young . but let me tell you , there are worse things than death . there is such a thing as evil .
you must be familiar with my favorite poem by yeats ? `` the second coming '' ?
if gandhi had a chef like paul , it would change the whole political situation in india .
you ca n't tempt me . do you hear ? i wo n't eat !
neil , it 's no use . you saw how he is .
just go . kristen needs you . keep her awake somehow . do it .
but in order to do so , the church must first prove her heresy , or else you 'll be burning a martyr ...
well then ? start proving ... or else the church will have another martyr !
yes , edna , and i must say you 've been great about the ...
stick the soft soap . let 's be having it .
this guy -- where did you meet him for the first time ? where did he come from ? who is he ?
did he have a wife ? did he had a girl friend ? did you know them ?
not that i do n't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me ?
the bar code on your neck , max . i know who you are and i know who you 're running from .
sarah williams left the bar with trudell on her own .
so ? girls left bars with ted bundy too . it does n't rule out foul play .
what 'd you do , take the scenic route ?
sshhh . no time for that . come on .
i ca n't , how can i , in all decency ? we 've had a good run , have n't we ?
what about venice ? can we stick to that plan at least ?
but why ? she 's the best friend i 've got .
she is n't anybody 's friend , and i do n't like you living with her . she 's a bad influence .
a man would look anywhere for her , mary . there is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her .
because i loved jacqueline i thought i knew her . today i found out such strange things frightening things . i saw a hangman 's noose that she had hanging - waiting  i feel as if i 'd never known her .
yes . now , will you let me go to chicago ?
you 're not going to like it in chicago . they wind comes howling in from the lake . and there 's practically no opera season at all - and the lord only knows whether they 've ever heard of lobster newburg -
we are happy , mrs. romari , because you have everything  and i am happy because i have nothing to lose .
but you should make her laugh , jason . come , make jokes for her . i 'll bring your food to their table .
there 'll be three , four men at the most . i have some backup , nothing will happen .
i 'm real sorry . in a while , you 're gone from this country . but we live here . no one wants to mix it up with those hombres .
ellie ... god does n't do things like that . i know you loved y'brother , but --
he can if he wants to . he can do anything , just like inspector gadget on tv . but i have to keep things ready for him , that 's what i think . i 've got his picture and i 'm going to sit in his chair --
[ not for a long time , sister . ]
[ the bible says , `` be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good . '' ]
look , will if you 're not in love with me , you can say that .
i 'm not sayin ' i 'm not in love with you .
uh ... yeah , grandma . she does n't mean that . kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke .
then i 'll throw a few more treats on the plate . where 's my smokes ?
i must 've left the original in the copy machine .
`` the second rule of fight club ... is this yours ?
do n't tell me your name , i do n't want to know ! i sure as hell ai n't gon na tell ya mine .
you 're right , this is bad . how did you get out ?
you tell me . i do n't know how you managed to hack into my mac , but : bravo .
what are you talking about ? you think i invited them ?
then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in noto ; are there any hotels or rooming houses ?
there 's the trinacria hotel ... or the regina , near the municipal building . as for rooming houses , i do n't know ...
you could start over again with cash like that .
go wherever you want . live how you want .
she was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were , bob .
i do n't believe it ! i ca n't believe it . she 's lying . you 're lying . you 're lying ! every word you 've been saying is a lie ! come on , say it !
i 'll -- i 'll get married . then i 'll never be able to go anywhere .
it 's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man .
she 's workin ' the late shift at the hospital . she 's at home now , i 'm going over there to talk to ...
gim me the address . i 'm gon na go . we 're going to need her .
what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?
i had something a little different in mind . instead of just playing peeping tom with reilly , why do n't you get him to show you what he 's been working on after hours ?
whoever they are -- this goes right back to dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
i know . agent scully reported your suspicions to opr . on the basis of her report , i sent techs over to s.a.c . michaud 's apartment . they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas .
a man may need to do that , and find it amusing ; but a girl is bound by other laws .
i believe you , and i see i must hasten to leave , for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men .
uh-huh . so how do you know it was a he ?
you got a girl -- am i screwing something up by being here ?
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull .
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull .
do n't you ever get messages , eyelashes ? i called you twice .
i 've been up to here . listen , honey , tell me something . you know susan hunsecker ... ? has she been in ? i mean lately , in the last coupla days ... ?
oui , bonjour , jean ... oui , trčs bien , merci . dites-moi , pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services ŕquelquun récemment ... vous ętes certain ... non , non ... je vous remercie ...
hello there . hows the flat . i cleaned ...
from the looks of davidson 's cable , it might even go higher than that . and we have n't even got a camera over there .
this could go off in a month -- or an hour .
oh my . meanwhile , kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and i 'm not seeing one dime .
i still do n't get why you 're trying to break into the system .
talk , daddy , i 'm listening . hey that ai n't bad . you got some more ?
that 's the last stuff you 'll ever get from me .
i want to do something < u > positive < /u > ...
you want some < u > advice < /u > .
being alone with you has always done this to me . you know that .
for a celebrated bounder , that is an awful admission . besides , i never knew that any female could do this to you .
ten dollars . but i need it to get home .
why would you want to go home ? it 's so early .
well , believe what you want , boss , but we got to be more careful . all these new volunteers , any one of them could be ...
okay , you handle it , numa . i do n't have time for this nonsense . we 've obviously got the bastards worried now . i 'm going to washington .
what 's the matter , george ? something wrong ? you look like you just fucked your mother .
cheer up , man . half this money is ours . we 're fucking rich .
domino . do you have a last name ... domino ?
no last names . just domino . the less you know about me the better , okay ?
we can forget horse racing , roulette , the stock market ... our worries are over ! you remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers ? you will be in a position to give it to me .
oh , leon , you are so good to me .
why 's he still a john doe ? why was n't he ever id 's from an eyescan ?
on account of those are not his eyes . he had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners .
someone who knows her well could still identify her , that 's not the problem . it 's just there 's , uh , it 's likely to be a shock .
well , let 's get the shock over with .
i want to get out from under all this for good . and i want to fuck them all doing it .
then i got ta say , in my opinion , you ca n't get what you want .
you know , it 's very strange -- i have been in the revenge business so long , now that it 's over , i do n't know what to do with the rest of my life .
have you ever considered piracy ? you 'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts .
if what you say is true , it is a matter for the police !
they 've done a fine job . hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend .
yeah , that 's right . now could you be quiet so i can get some sleep .
ten dollars . i 'll find a way to pay you back . how would you like to know about somewhere special ? the perfect beach . paradise . no one else knows about it . that 's got to be worth something . what do you say ?
oh . why ? does he live up here ?
not exactly . but it 's his kind of neighborhood .
sure you can ! you may even like it ... it 's a killer rush . you 'll see . hey , do n't i show you things , johnny u ?
bodhi , this is your wake up call , man -- i ... am ... an ... eff ... bee ... eye ... agent ! !
before you ask there 's nothing new on the coke .
you 've got to get me something i can use , charlie .
damn , porkchop , you sound just like a guy who ai n't never seen a pair .
i 've seen 'em . i 've seen 'em .
as obvious as that ? our security people will jump for joy . i suppose duval 's onto me , too ?
you 're not the first , but he 's much too innocent , much too involved with his work , to realize what 's going on around him .
if only you 'd remained true to our contract ! opiates , for his nerves ! restraints ! the man warrants a bed of nails --
i can say , with the utmost sincerity , that every franc you 've given me has been put to sterling use .
you must go now . be careful on your way to your room .
i 'll go . -- i love you . i 'll be on that train . i 'll get the money .
that was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital 's batteries . how 'd you do it ?
it was n't a trick . i used to be an electrical engineer .
i do n't see where that 's any of your business .
did those two muscle heads shake you down ? swear i 've seen them down at the track with sure-shot riley . that 's it , ai n't it ? a gambling debt .
this ai n't no social call . one hundred bucks . to find my father .
did he just say what i think he said ?
yeah , yeah it is , howard . and here i was thinking i could tell you something you did n't know .
it 's a good quote , mary . i 'm glad we both know it .
well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something sun-powered , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
you leave me at the mercy of my enemies .
enemies , bob ? you been talking about the queen again ? on independence day ?
i guess what i mean is , my mother married my dad after you ... and then i was born , so i thought that ... maybe you got divorced because of me .
wait ... woah ... woah ... wait a minute ... do you think i 'm your father ?
eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ... five - net - launch-ers ...
yeah -- it 's santa 's magic fucking village . your present 's in here .
... if i may quote the twentieth century poet - joe piscahpo : you look marvelous ...
lloyd , when we were in principal collins 's office , did you see any kind of chest ?
to pay for the next expedition , of course .
but that 's a circular argument ! if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition , they cancel each other out .
listen you stupid fuck , i want my car .
take it . as soon as i get my money . fifty dollars for an almost new gasket . you do n't know what kind of a deal you 're getting .
you would be , two , if you 'd gone through what he went through .
he raped a < u > nun < /u > ...
look , not a single scene shot in the studio ! we 've found natural locations for the whole story --
hold on a sec . i got news . we finally found somewhere to premiere kane but --
no ! what are you -- you 're serious about this ?
i 've called liz . they can set me up with a trailer for pilgrim . i thought we 'd stay at motels along the way ...
well , arletta , i got to stand down here .
i allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with .
well , how are you enjoying your first day on the job ?
i think i lost a week 's salary at the dart board .
who 're you tellin ' to get , boy ? ! you watch it , or there 'll be some dyin ' done 'round here !
that dyin 's gon na be done two ways .
hard for me ? hard for me ? hard for me ? hard for me ? you had questions ?
i checked with the school board , she 's not an accredited teacher .
he sleeps quietly . he died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man , drossos , like his father before him .
because he was a brave man - because i liked him -- i came here to be sure .
to know about it ? it was a kill squad . black on black . closed down two years ago . nobody wants to know about treadstone . not around here . you better take this back to marty and make sure he knows what you 're doing .
he does . i 've been down to the archives . i have the files , ward .
you and creasy both . a two man army according to interpol . panama . lebanon with the druze . desert storm . where you were contracted by the u.s. army to hunt down elite iraqi military commanders . you two were a married couple .
the kind that gets divorced , but still stay friends .
you 've never actually met truman , yourself . never thought about doing a cameo -- playing a veterinarian , or a priest , something like that ?
i 've been tempted . but i think it 's important to retain objectivity . i would n't want to get emotionally caught up .
i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you .
fuck you , fuck cleveland , and fuck your contracts --
sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago .
the star 's going to collapse in a matter of minutes .
no , no . say it backwards , shit-wit . sra-i'm-sick say it backwards !
sra-i'm-sick . sick - kiss i 'm - my kiss my ! sra-i'm-sick - kiss my arse !
i guess you have to get back home soon ?
not really , why ? you want to see the building ? . come on , i 'll show you .
... that 's all well and good , captain , save for one thing : there 's no gold down there .
what are you talking about ? we went through all this and the ship is n't even down there ?
you may not like this , chief , but you 're beginning to act paranoid . i mean , you really are .
you found out about dave ferrie going to texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on . you 're a goddamn spy .
i 'm sure he is n't . though he 's certainly adept at killing .
he was doing his job , protecting the girl . if police were involved , you figure it out . i 'm here for him .
o lady dear ! are you so hot ? henceforward do your messages yourself .
here 's such a coil ! come , what says romeo ?
have you been in contact with the principal about your job ?
i thought about calling , but i want to wait until i know when i 'll be out .
that wo n't be necessary : just take me to regula i .
excuse my presumption , but i do not agree . as a teacher on a training mission , i am content to command a starship . if we are to go on actual duty , it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command .
you damn right they did n't , especially emory , my cousin .
emory had made a lot of enemies . he had a big mouth .
seven minutes ago , the third course change in an hour . those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort .
can we move it to a different orbit in time ?
okay . i think everything 's set . you 've got the number for cape cod , right ? just in case something goes wrong .
no problem , vinnie . everything 's under control . i could run this store in my sleep .
he was a big loser ! what are you deaf ! ?
uh , no and i do n't appreciate ... turn down here !
and what was he doing here in the first place ? that 's what i want to know . what 's a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for ? are you some kind of pervert , or what ?
look , lady , that 's enough . if you do n't calm down . i 'm going to throw you out . do you hear me ? right now !
well , that 's pathetic . poor rose , what a life she has had .
we make our own lives , madam . as for malignancy , i do n't think so , it 's very unlikely . i probably should n't have even mentioned that possibility to her .
it 's nothing to do with you . it 's me they wanted , not you . why do you interfere in other people 's business ?
you 're mad , that 's your trouble , you 're mad .
because he asked you to ! he entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body . he asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you : his katra . his living spirit .
sir . your son meant more to me than you can know . i 'd have given my life if it would have saved his . you must believe me when i tell you that he made no request of me !
one considers her timing , of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down . suggestive , even borderline suspicious , but hardly conclusive .
well , you 've thorough about it , at any rate .
we ca n't stop him . not now . handcuffed , with no kind of weapons . please andy ...
no . we have to try . we 'll figure something out . and if midnight comes before we can get to him , well , then we go together . deal ? shake a paw ?
i 'm an evolutionary biologist . what do you do ?
nothing . i 'm in third grade . what 's a revolutionary what ch'a ma ' callit ?
the most . you ever lost . on a coin toss .
i do n't know . i could n't say .
& quot ; in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon ... & quot ;
are n't you going to drink your cocoa ? it 's the good kind .
i 'm looking for my daughter , caroline . she comes here .
this is a business . get the fuck outta here .
i made a great reporter out of you , hildy , but you wo n't be half as good on any other paper , and you know it . you need me and i need you -- and the paper needs both of us .
well , the paper 'll have to learn to do without me . and so will you . it just did n't work out , walter .
good ! leave me alone when i 'm sleeping . i 'm gon na get a lock on my door , to keep ya ass outta here .
do n't ya love ya brother mookie anymore ? i loves ya , jade .
i 'm ellen creed and i live at alden lane , dearborn , michigan . at least , i used to .
and now you live on route in ludlow , and your dad 's gon na be the new doctor up to the college , i hear , and i think you 're going to be just as happy as a clam here , ellen creed .
well , you 'd have to keep it under control .
and what if , just say , there was a kidnap attempt ?
to celebrate misery 's return . i could n't have done it without you .
oh , paul . it would be an honor .
if this is a joke , it 's not funny .
dmitri hired him ! he 's already killed all your witnesses , now he 's coming after you ! he was stalking you when i dropped you off . i do n't know what happened , but he diverted and got into my cab , instead .
this is captain pavel chekov speaking . you are in violation of neutral zone treaty . i advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences .
your threats amuse me , captain chekov . what consequences did you have in mind ?
i know - here i am always a brown man , there you would be always a white woman .
is that what you think ? is that what you think i think ?
but that did n't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks .
well , come on -- it is your life . nobody is tying you to the fast track . did you go to college ?
but , i do n't like horses . do i have to get on one ?
eh , forget it . what else is big ? teenagers ! jailbait pics ! yeah ... you got the juvenile delinquent , his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
i do n't see no wedding ring , banks . conjugal visits are for married prisoners only .
you think you could make an exception just this once , boss ? she came all the way down from new york .
the soul . the spirit . whatever you want to call it .
ah , the part of us that ca n't be explained .
it 's a goddamn bunion . it 'll heal .
oh . i thought that 's not it anyway . i know this does n't make any sense to you , but i just ca n't turn it off that fast . i still feel something for her .
i thought i was a widow . my husband ... the only man i ever loved ... is dead . for the rest of my life i have to live with that .
the death of peter peel was a great loss . to us all ...
but dreams do n't pay the bills , do they ? same old reed , the hopeless optimist . still reaching for the stars , with the world on your back .
you remember in school we talked about working together . that 's what i was about to explain ...
this is the only place in rome where i thought -- i believed -- i was wholly in power .
narcissus will never support you , caesar , he has too much of a philosophical temperament .
hey fella ! relax ! this whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out . let 's make love .
do you remember when you first got here ? we used to talk all night long . until the sun came up ... we would just lie in bed and talk .
i do n't think i 've done anything to sound off about .
we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns . if we do n't blow them - who will ?
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer .
right . a clean deduction from observed facts . they 've got to be simple once in a while , inspector .
`` mistake '' ? what 's that supposed to ... ?
it does n't matter , all right ? it 's dead .
forgive my crudity , darlin ' . i do n't understand these deeper things the way you do .
be nice to rose . she 's never had a real home .
i 'd draw my sword , and cut my way through them .
what , with me on the pillion ? would you kill poor me ?
do n't be ridiculous . there is no such thing as a portal into someone else 's brain .
brain . soul , i 'm telling you , lotte . i was right inside him looking out . we 're going to be rich .
what do you think ? any chance ? there 's nothin ' else i 'm any good at , but this .
call me next week . we 'll talk about it .
i 'm here , dad . i 'm here .
we did it , john . we stopped him .
what it says on the bumper sticker up front . on that pickup .
that 's disgustin ' . those kinda sentiments should n't be allowed out in public . is this biloxi yet ?
< i > my real father was an actor . he died when i was a little girl. < /i >
wow . laurence harvey . he knew frank sinatra ? i knew frank .
well , matter of fact , i do n't have any .
just a second now . that 's your truck . is n't it ?
you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back ? is that correct , o'neil ?
only four minutes to neutral waters , sir . why not ?
there seem to be lots of reasons why i should n't .
there are lots of reasons . do you want to come up ?
pendergast may be in trouble . do n't you understand ? he still has n't come back . it 's been over three hours --
he 'll be back . relax . we 're in good shape . your security is air tight . there 've been no more incidents , nothing suspicious . there 's no reason to call off the opening now .
i ... i love it . i have n't been there since i was a kid . but it 's nearly two o'clock . i really should be getting back to whitehall and marks .
nonsense ! as far as whitehall and marks are concerned , you 're working with bialystock , right ?
i 'm fine . you throw quite a party . i did n't know they had christmas in japan .
hey , we 're flexible . pearl harbor did n't work out , we got you with tape decks .
what was in the 'miami herald ' and the 'times . ' confessions ?
eighty-six so far . all cranks . he smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces . none of them knew that ;
... one day he 'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they wo n't know what to make of him . the thick brow , so lacking in imagination . the dim little eyes , devoid of curiosity .
you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers .
who 'd you see , sam ? the man on the floor ?
no ... i saw the man who killed him .
i know you do n't think much of being needed , or of me for that matter ...
i 'm sorry for what i said about wally needing you . it was ... unnecessary .
so , things change . the government has moved to the circus . you 're going to fight last . and commodus is going to fight first .
you were a soldier , and then a gladiator , were n't you ?
at least he 's not a cop . at least he can afford a decent gift .
i used to buy.you , ..stuff . on your birthday . when we were seeing each other .
she can do that stuff for you . anyway , just wear some of my things , wear anything you want , most of it 's ancient .
now your signature . not `` dickie '' . your signature .
which is it ? you got ta keep your focus straight .
you 're absolutely right . the focus is on the college admissions process today .
it seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed .
i 'm sorry , sara . i 've been trying to tell you . it 's all my --
sirica 's just trying to force one of them to testify . but they 're solid .
then what about this washington post crap ? woodwind and fernstein ?
that 's mr. potato head to you , you back-stabbin ' murderer !
now , it was an accident ! guys , c'mon now , you ... you got ta believe me
but you are aware , he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager .
no ... if he did , i do n't remember him . there were lots of kids in and out ... y'know .
i know barnes six months and i 'll tell ya something - that man is mean , red in his soul like a dick on a dog .
barnes gets killed , his jaws 'd go on clacking ...
uh , no , i did n't see him at all .
what 's got into that cat ? well if you do see him , tell him i 've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
everything i am is because of you . can you ever forgive me ?
oh , teddy . we missed you so much .
the grammys . he 's got a lotta records up for awards .
you mean they give awards for that kind o ' music ?
halo ? < u > marty < /u > ? what would they have used instead of an old mill ? we need it tonight . marty ? yeah you were saying ... ?
i ca n't write it . i lost my typewriter .
sure . you shouted at me in the auditorium when i read my essay .
no , my dear . you must be mistaken .
... well , it did n't make him happy ...
but there is no possibility he would have taken his own life ?
no ... did megan say when she 's coming back from her ... visit ?
of course not . she probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it . i still do n't get it . why him ? i mean , he 's cute alright , but ...
here 's this dog that tried to eat me . here 's my motel . here 's the car i rented ...
stop it . are you saying my husband is defrauding me ?
when i first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher i got really afeard . i thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven .
i imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the seventh national bank of tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party .
no , wait ! i thought you were blind !
it 's all right . trust me . do n't move .
if you 'd just let me talk to you for a little while , miss alexander . all i want to ask you ...
get out of here ! get out ! get out !
there 's a one-drink minimum per show , i hope you saw the sign when you came in . anyway , they 're supposed to tell you .
yes , i heard , and it 's not a problem .
where were you last night ? i called your house like four times .
i went to sleep . i think i have the flu or something .
a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle tom 's cabin .
darling , this would be wonderful ! just once ... were n't you attacked by a bolshevik ?
i 'm on a diet . but thank you .
you do n't need to lose any weight . you 're kidding , right ? you look great . very fit .
that feller 's a whole sight meaner than me . he 'd just whup the tar out of me .
yeah , i guess so . i 'm real tired , you know that . a kid my age should n't be tired of things .
you 're not ready yet . they said two days .
i 'm not jacking with armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck .
nine performances ! nine ! that 's all it 's had - and withdrawn .
i know ; it 's outrageous . still , if the public does n't like one 's work one has to accept the fact gracefully .
that 's what i 'm afraid of . could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard ?
i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit .
it 's amazing what ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses .
so , blocker , what do you think of our boy ?
i know . i have acrophobia . what a disease . a fear of heights . and what a moment to find out i had it .
well , you 've got it . and there 's no losing it . and there 's no one to blame . so why quit ?
mr rothstein . mr rothstein , i 'm sorry . we 've got some complaints about - about the noise .
i 'm just trying to get in my house !
damn it , mom . i told you i need them all !
fine . you 'll get them , evan . but i think it 's far more important to focus on your case right now .
i 've offered you some warm broth . i thought perhaps-
you get out of here ! if any of you men think you can come busting in here-
it 's my job to keep my job . and that , by the way , is now head of praetorian guard . good ole tribuus has been retired .
quintus , you 've got at least a division with you -- we could take rome away from commodus and give it back to the senate !
to show me he does n't have to talk to me if he does n't want to .
oh , what is this ? some kind of staring contest between two kids from the `` old neighborhood ? ''
what are you thinking of , bella ? can i eat dry ?
oh , the wine . i have forgotten the wine .
if you do n't quit it , will , i 'm leaving .
you 're breaking my heart . got to see a man about a dog .
forgive me , your majesty . in no way did i wish to suggest --
i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy ... .
who ? who knew just where to hit us ? and < u > why < /u > ?
one thing is certain ; we can not escape on auxiliary power .
i capture quebec leading an army by river fordings through maine ... if we do n't do it , the british will come down champlain , take back ticonderoga and attack us in the spring .
you 'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness .
you boys seem to think you 've got a champ in there , huh ?
i do n't see you scoring any points , buddy . and you 're just the man for the job , right ?
no . i only needed the code from you .
then we would have talked , you and i .
your intentions are noble , but no diesel fuel for heat . no coolants to preserve food . millions would die of cold and hunger alone .
acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet .
i can take them to work with me -- i can shift things around --
you do n't need to . i do n't expect you to handle them yourself .
now what is this talk about joining the army ? eh ?
it 's not talk ; i 'm doing it .
i do n't know . it 's all been like a crazy nightmare , mr. dickson .
what happened ? you 're not a thief . how 'd you get mixed up with these kind of people ?
jesus christ earl ... what are we doing ? ...
we 're doing what we got ta do , to protect ourselves !
i 'm pretty close . but when i wrote the last contact switches , it wiped out a piece of the content filer . you know what it 's like , writing software .
i do know . you focus on the big problem . but somewhere down the chain , something breaks down . something gets destroyed . at first it 's upsetting . you feel you 've lost control .
i thought i was dead . lucky for me you jokers showed up , eh ?
it was n't luck . rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you ...
why ? we did pretty well , would n't you say ?
five hundred wars ... arms ... drugs ... money ... everything you create is used to destroy ...
-- sloan told the grand jury -- he answered everything they asked him -- that means there 's a record somewhere --
-- and the fbi confirms -- what more do you need ? --
you ca n't < u > do < /u > that , i wo n't < u > let < /u > you !
no , no , no , this is a job that 's hard to < u > keep < /u > , < u > not < /u > a job that 's hard to < u > lose < /u > , ca n't be both .
i know . this is a dream , sarah .
oh . yeah . they ... make me take this stuff ...
so do i. as a matter of fact , i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music .
good school ! and your family does n't object to your career ?
one d-6 and one d-8 in the well . and a dead d-8 on the deck .
which you inferred was replaced by the d-6 , which must have been a spare .
put that away , slug ! at your service !
i got a trunk in that room . will you get it out for me ?
pleased to meet you finally , george . i am augusto oliveras .
my pleasure , augusto . diego has told me much about you .
i just charged $ to our room for that movie . now i 'll never know how the story ends .
do n't fuck with me , ed . not you , not tonight .
that 's all you 've got to say , you 've got a bad cold ?
well , i do n't know what happened . they were arguin ' about baseball , then all of 'em started fightin ' . as for that policeman , i did n't bite him , i do n't think i bit him .
nothing ... she grabbed me , and then there was an image on the screen ...
she grabbed you ? impossible . the precogs are n't even aware of us . in the milk all they see is the future .
you were in my dream just now . your hair was different , but i 'm sure it was you .
we dream about what 's important in our lives . and i seem to have become pretty important in yours . what was the dream about ?
i need help all right . they 're coming after me .
first , it 's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running . okay ?
reptilian swine . there 's no such thing . reptiles are n't swine .
who cares ? ! you hired an actor ? ?
we can prosecute the new york times , go for an injunction ...
... but it 's not , bottom-line , gon na change a goddamn thing , john . the question is : how do we screw ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of god into all leakers ?
we 're fucked . we 're in a haunted house and we ca n't get out until the morning .
you do n't really believe it 's haunted ... do you believe in ghosts ?
you mean ... tonight ? with all those things still out there ?
oh , sure . why not ? sounds like a hoot .
i saw your daughter . she 's beautiful ! who knows how many salvatores must be running after her ...
one or two . bur there 're not all that many salvatores . i 've got a son , too ... he 's older . and you , do you have children ?
you picked up that girl right in front of me .
hey , no strings , right ? that 's what you always said . just good pals who have the hots for each other .
you 're already gettin ' psychological input , son .
go stick your head in a tub of ice water . see where she leads .
you said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease ?
i can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
< u > i < /u > dunno ... . ambassador to < u > togo < /u > , somethin ' , < u > i < /u > dunno ... he ...
maybe he 's just a < u > patriot < /u > .
i did n't even know they had stores that just sold comic books .
well , we sell other things too . cool stuff . `` man from u.n.c.l.e . '' lunch boxes . `` green hornet '' board games . shit like that . but comic books are main business . there 's a lot of collectors around here .
what we need is a space for real performance art . a cultural exchange for radical expressionism .
you 've got to stop using that word `` we '' it 's getting kind of scary . right katka ?
i do n't know what that means . what kind of problem ?
the kind where there is n't really an answer .
no ... . keep him in here ... and make sure he does n't ...
oh , yes ! we 'll keep him in here , obviously . but if he had to leave and we were with him .
that does n't seem to be happening , does it ?
i 've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil hitler . how am i supposed to --
how come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets , preacher ?
i come not with peace but with a sword .
ethan , you 're not making sense . let me go in and talk to kittridge . i 'm going to tell him you had nothing to do ...
claire , claire , claire , if you 're not dead , he 's going to assume you 're with me .
we 're sorry to startle you , miss tate .
the door was open , so we let ourselves in .
maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket ?
< i > < /i > hey ! ! hey , you ! !
hey , butt-head , it 's that slut from the plane !
why it 's you two . how 'd ya do in vegas ?
< u > this < /u > is your movie , this is small town america .
town in new hampshire was small town america too . forty thousand dollars a day , to shoot on the street . and < u > then < /u > they kicked us out ...
first you 've got her buying your file . now you 've got her killing nilsen . forget her , willya ? go someplace . sit in the sun . get away from this goddamn fog . get her out of your system .
you do n't but it , do you ? she knew nobody would but it . she knew i 'd say she did it . and she knew nobody would buy it .
is n't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ?
yes . i found that a very expensive hobby , too . but then i never was much of a businessman .
my daughter is n't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody* .
well , then -- this is too much for *my* lame brain . i 'm calling jim taylor .
hello , ralph . how 'd you make out with those nurses last night , ralph ?
oh man , you shoulda come with us last night , marty . that one for you was a real lunatic . how 'd you make out ?
my own name is a killing word . will it be a healing word as well ?
usul ... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard ... the fedaykin .
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier . from the gitgo , from jump street .
hold on a sec , i got a call .
why ca n't you believe that you did everything you could ?
did i ? i do n't know . maybe i should n't have gone out on that line . maybe i panicked .
okay , lucy , it 's time to go meet barbra ...
i felt like a nazi , but it had to be done .
just banged my head . it was an accident .
another accident ? you got to be more careful .
you are the devil ! you are the instrument of satan !
shhhh ! do you want to frighten our little daughter ?
why did you call me ? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you .
gosh . gee , lynne ... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves . ext . movie theater - day
you do n't know , walter ? you seem to know the answer to everything else !
hmm . well , we were in a handicapped spot . it , uh , it was probably towed .
you 'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you .
okay , then . put a guard on me . i want you to put a guard on me . because if anything goes wrong out there , this time you wo n't have a patsy . right ?
he had a videocamera ? where is she ? quickly !
she washes hair up at ludwig 's - a salon on 63rd and madison .
david . there 's a call for you . it 's your wife .
great . classic timing . why do n't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce ? i 'll check my diary later .
if i could get to the bridge i could send the distress signal .
even if we do , it might be too late .
you took him to the funeral , i hear .
he 'd never seen a corpse . he 's seen a dozen now .
three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world 's ever known .
it 's one of the world 's greatest creatures .
he knew about nasa . what if he made the call to shut us down --

i mean , why are you making this documentary if you ca n't treat your subject with appropriate gravity ?

we 've got nothing , bob . this wo n't work .

i had a nasty foreboding feeling at first , but now i realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture .
from now on , you 're sleeping in the house , where we can keep an eye on you .
well -- then it 's got ta be a different than what 's in our water , cause ours is okay . the guys from pg & e told me . they sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine .
i know . but the toxicologist i been talking to ? he gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure . and everything you all have is on that list .
i hate waiting . i could give you my word as a spaniard .

what was that dell , i lost you , do you read me ?
i 'm sorry i sent for you , brad - i did n't -
chicago is pretty close to new york nowadays - only twenty hours -
that 's what i 'm saying , will . you 'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you 're afraid to take the first step because all you 're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road .
oh , what ? you 're going to take the professor 's side on this ?
what about the money you owe me on yesterday 's game ?
fuck yesterday 's game . the world series is seven games not six . put in my bet .
after you change , if you 're not busy elsewhere , we can have supper .

double homicide . a year ago . las halloween .
to tell you that we 're interested in the property .
you told me that on the phone . what the hell are you doing here ? showing off your communication skills ? go back to your people and tell them when they 're serious to put a number on the table .

mother , i can explain everything . i 'll go with you in five minutes and --
colonel charles lee ... hounds and all . quite the character . he 's got a tremendous reputation .
i think many would like to see him commander-in-chief .
she might ! ! ! she might do it , albert , but you ca n't fuckin ' tell me that she does ! ! !
she does , vince ! that 's what i 'm telling you ! she does ! ! !
i do n't think about the shot that much .
you have to think about the shot . it 's the shot . the shot 's it .
well , i was worried about you and i wanted to make sure you were alright ... and i guess i was sort of hoping i could ask you about what happened ...
oh , that ... sure , i saw the whole thing . it was disgusting !
laugh all you want , but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who 's ready to party .
do n't listen to him . you call whenever it feels right to you .
no , i have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing .
now do n't be absurd , smith may i come in ?
boys , boys , why do n't we compare our gun calibers later ? the issue is maureen prescott !
wrong , this issue is sidney prescott ! and either mr. riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her . so , where is she ?
uh , thanks . god i 'm so excited ! so , are you ready to take me to the principal 's office ? he whips out the key , she takes it .
so no small talk ? good , 'cause i do n't know how to make that . yep . small talk . not for me . not a fan . got any hobbies ? how 'bout this weather ?
you better figure it out -- exactly . suppose she asks you why you did n't come home last night ?
i 'll tell her i spent the night with a friend .
well , whatever his name is , he 's not here anymore . he left two days ago , and i have n't heard from him since .
and what was he doing here in the first place ? that 's what i want to know . what 's a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for ? are you some kind of pervert , or what ?

i thought you 'd given up on my picture .
you just said it . he 's my friend . nothing else to say .
i read the file . you and creasy have been seen quite a bit together .
you just drove a fucking customer away , barry .
we did n't even really have it . i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is `` do n't drive drunk . '' i was just goofing on the straight , and it never cost you a penny .
< i > the bitch was bluffing . there were no dupe tapes . if there were ... they 'd have shown them to me by now. < /i >
show me the tapes . i want to see them .
convene -- that 's it -- yes . i got to pick up some of those parliamentary words . i imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the senate without 'em --
with or without 'em . twelve -- noon . the senate convenes at twelve o'clock .
well i 'm not sure why you 're calling me .
there 's no number for frank in any of earl 's stuff and he 's pretty out of it -- i mean , like i said , he 's dying , y'know . dying of cancer .
okay . if you 've got a bug problem-a big one . and they 're swarming and there 's no way to shoot them all individually ... how do you get rid of them ?
the only thing i could think of would be ... you 'd have to get rid of the queen .
you have n't changed at all ! some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him !
did it look like i was siding with him ? did it ? you want to play with the bad boys , you better be prepared . do you have protection ?
that 's the point . i 'd like to be bothered .
i do n't see how you could know about these things unless elliot 's been talking to you .

waal , that 's where you < u > want < /u > em ...
i 'm late . got ta protect and serve the world , y'know .
the world can wait , jon . you 're going .
she came to me with a wild story about demonic possession .
she 's got a juvenile record from new orleans . parents died when she was .
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director ?
because i am the director . do n't you realize , if it was n't for my film , for my talent , my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now .
jack , this is graham . is price still in latent prints ?
he 's working on the single print index . what time is it ?
max ! relax ! josh and jen 'll put a spin on this . we 'll talk it over tonight , at your costume par --
i think you 'd feel out of place at my party . you see , it 's for winners .
call it xenophobic paranoia . do n't you see the absolute absurdity of this ? this is n't about them , it 's about us -- our violence , our fear and mistrust --
dr. arroway , you are entitled to your opinion . but we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown , completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless .
oh harry , you 're so funny . now i have something that 's kind of delicate ...
oh , you want to talk about your delicates ?
yeh , i think so . i gave the kay- ducer a c-note . you find out the deck ?
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza . i got you one of each . he likes to cold deck low , 's or 's .
`` graverobbers from outer space '' ! it 's < u > money in the bank < /u > .
graverobbers from < u > what < /u > ? ?
when you 're investigatin ' , how long ya keep at it ?
it consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice . we try to oblige .
what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you .
i want to talk to them first . i know more now about ordell 's money .
what for , honey ? you know we can look after you . you 've made the gesture --
it 's not a gesture . i want to do this on my own . come on , trust me a little will you ?
nor i. this is why i gave it to you .
you 're a young man . you 're romantic . you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together . you think a soft voice means a soft heart . you 'll grow out of that .
you see , from this vertebrae i shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton .
wait a minute , you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone ?
yeah , right . why do n't you show it to your `` girlfriend '' ?
jessica and i are through . i could n't stand being with her knowing you liked her . it was n't worth our friendship . oh , and she also has a boyfriend .
come on . i want you to see something .
you want me to give up , huh ? look , sal 's in back with the girls . anything happens to me - one move - and sal gives it to them . boom boom . how do i know you wo n't jump me ?
man , you 're livin ' dangerously . let me ask you somethin ' , you always have to get women drunk before they 'll sleep with you ?
you kiddin ' ? they try to get me drunk .
peerless , i did n't raise a buffoon . we have enough of those on television already .
please let me know when you hear from daddy , get a number or something .
i 'd be glad to . not now , of course -- with you alone .
perhaps you 'd rather discuss it personally with the president --
-- price killed her , there 's no other explanation --
-- there 's plenty : for all we know , steven 's got her spying on us right now --
claire , she 's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you were n't thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong .
i never said i was n't upset . of course i 'm upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard ... and it was n't some `` symptom '' of something ...
what owners , harold ? we do n't < u > own < /u > anything . it 's a transitory world . we come on the earth with nothing , and we go out with nothing , so is n't `` ownership '' a little absurd ?
still , i think you 'd upset people and i 'm not sure that 's right .
what kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves , 'think i 'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today ' ?
the same type that decides to carve into her stomach .
what the fuck are you talking about , man ?
the set-up is wrong . we 're doing all the legwork , and at the end of the day , we 're still paying retail . we 're getting middled .
so , if the party starts at eight , why are we first going to a bar at ten ?
to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven .
`` the wrong hands '' ? we 're not talking about military secrets , john . they 're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off .
jesus christ . and he does n't have sex with any of them ? they just talk ?
i got more brains than you 've got teeth .
put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is . i 'll bet this mornings pay i 'm right .
if it came down to who eats who , damn skippy .
with that terrible mug of yours if jayne kennedy told you to eat her pussy , kiss her ass , lick her feet , chow on her shit , and suck her dog 's dick , nigger , you 'd aim to please .
why do n't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late ?
i used the last one to jump off the cliff ...
mom , you 're upset . sit down ... please ... .
i wo n't have anyone in my family any- where near the water ... . never again ... never ... .
the timing was off -- i need this light .
< u > just < /u > where i wan na be all saturd ...
serial killer is not really accurate , ma'am . the killer has yet to strike twice .
well , we can hope , ca n't we ? we certainly do n't have any leads . a ghost mask , a cellular phone -- not much there .
we got a phone , here , that 's got a little ring .
sam , get the body and put it in the van . sheriff cable , where were you the night teresa banks was murdered ?
easy . we 're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before . some kind of animals . real fast , volatile , predators . one went through three of your patrons like they were kleenex .
so , your dead hubby shot me twice , three of my customers have been eaten , and there are angry creatures outside ?
adelle told me , your writing is going well . the crusader for social issues and all .
you were right . from the heart is always better .
turns out you did me a favor . you 're looking at a rich man .
-- the phones , theo . do n't leave any of them behind . the cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you .
do you have any evidence against him , jim ? clay shaw 's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the quarter . he 's well connected , all his friends , the money , people , be careful , jim .
it 'll be off the record , honey . i 'll bring him in on a sunday . a quiet little chat between gentlemen .
well , if you love him so much , why did n't you go see him play ?
um , because you did n't want to go .
there 's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation ?
the lawyer ; questadt , he belongs to roth .
you killed him ! come on with the rest of it . you killed him !
no -- i did n't . it was igor at the waxworks .
we 're not gon na bet , we 're just gon na watch .
watch bingo ? i do n't even like to play bingo .
the first match i got in mind for you is in louisville , kentucky .
you name the place , boss . i 'll be there .
a marked man gets wise and wants to come in .
his testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what 's left of the la cosa nostra is this country . that alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with witness protection .
hey , it has been known . c'mon terri , i 'm not that bad a guy . i have regrets . i 'd like to put things right . do n't tell me you have n't thought about me . huh ?
well ... of course i have . i 've thought . i 've ... oh , jp , you were so horrible . you really hurt me ...
uh unh , carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket .
an ex-cop that does n't carry . it 's embarrassing . i oughta not be seen with you . hey , mace . what 's goin ' on ?
you think money is the only requisite . it happens that the poor people are happier .
then marry ralph ... you 'll be the happiest couple in the world .
i know how they reward failure . if they saw this i 'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others .
there 's a new potion -- he said it was perfected .
that 's right . and guess who 's the new king of the unemployment line .
aw , come on , kid . throw me a bone . i 'm your uncle for gosh sakes .
open your eyes , she 's eleven years old ! her only friend in the world is dead .
i know that , but what do you want from me ?
honey , you know what i 've been like lately ... i 've been a total zombie . i have no idea what that was doing in my pocket .
well , what about < u > these < /u > ? do you usually put your < u > carbons < /u > in your pocket , too ? !
what , the setup did n't work so you want the key back ?
catlett says if you do n't open the locker the deal 's off .
not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you , rog , but it 's all i got , and ... ... all i got i share with you . go ahead . take all you want .
you touch my spleen , rollo . and here all the time i was thinking -- if i ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well , at least there 's rollo . he 's in vd and he 's happy .
shit ! where the hell are tom and angelina ?
i do n't know . screw them . look , what 's important is that we stick together . no matter what . if anyone is next it 's you or me jen .
i take it your son is not married , mrs spitz ?
no . and before you ask , no , hes not gay ! he has had girlfriends , but nothing serious ...
did n't this investigation , with its attendant publicity , catapult you into the office you now hold ?
if i were sitting where i normally sit , i would say `` calls for speculation . ''
you should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here !
n-n-n-n-no , no , i du-du-du-did n't , i did n't !
oh , book ? oh , no , i ... i 'm killing time . i ... i-i just , uh , w-want to browse , uh ...
well , you sure picked the right place . i mean , you can stay here all afternoon , not buy anything and just read .
it 's as simple as that . you 've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of freud , jung and maxwell jones in one grand analogy : it 's a pecking party .
i 'm not talking about fred yoong or maxwell jones , buddy , what i 'm talkin ' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you !
you think out of all those hitlers you could find just one ...
it was the same thing in germany . we looked for years before we found the right hitler .
... all those voices ... you gather them all together . millions of intelligences in one consciousness ... and now we 're a part of it .
you always have been . we 're all descendants of the same stars , ellie . all made of the same primordial atoms .
yes , it 's a girl i saw at the station .
what 's she like ? what 's she like ? ...
actually this is all just a bad dream . you 're home in bed . heavily sedated , resting comfortably , and dying from the carcinogens you 've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering . tragic irony or poetic justice ? you tell me .
my god ... it 's true . the penguin- man of the sewers ... please , do n't h --
i 'm quitting too . boys , not baseball .
there might be an opening for a manager at salem next spring .
the boys had 'em . i know you like these things ; wondered if you wanted them ?
er , yeah , sure , i 'll have 'em .
dr. zira , i 'd like to kiss you good-bye .
all right , but ... . ... you 're so damned ugly !
maybe not . i was a different person then . does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this ?
mostly . it must be my face . my mother always said i looked like a priest .
yeah , but that 's not-that 's no good . i want the whole thing .
well , i need grass and so do you .
exactly that . we can put you inside someone else 's body for fifteen minutes .
oh , this is just the medical breakthrough i 've been waiting for . are their any side effects ? please say no ! please say no !
yes , i do n't know what to make of it .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
that why you moved from the last town ? 'cause you were in trouble ? you can talk about it if you want to -- i know about it anyway . routine check .
and they think they are protecting my by moving .
if you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to -- gee ... if you could only have been my father ... we could ...
hey ... you flipped -- or something ? you better take off ...
well , you ca n't do that . you 're a free man . you 've been let out to do as you please .
i reckon i do n't care nothin ' about bein ' a free man . i do n't know how to go about it .
you are completely relaxed . when i count to three , you will open your eyes . one ... two ... three . we 'll start with something easy . what is your name ?
peggy sue kelcher . or , peggy bodell . i 'm not sure .
you do n't understand . he wants all the money that is in your bank .
i 've got eight hundred pounds . oh jesus .
why , if you were to point a pistol at a king or a queen , sir , i can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied ...
i would n't point no pistol at nobody , sir .
i do n't know what to say except i 'm sorry . i just do n't have rabbits on my mind .
i think you care more about john kennedy than your family ! all day long the kids are asking , `` where 's daddy ? '' what am i supposed to tell your kids , jim !
but he knows you . all you have to do is get in touch with him , and tell him that mimi says everything is all right ... but that i 've got to see him .
i tell you again , i do n't want any part of it . now you take dorothy home and ...
well , now me and mickey are gon na take it easy . just enjoy each other 's company , stop and smell the roses , notice the color purple , stuff like that .
how do you intend to disappear ? you 're probably the most famous couple in america .
`` please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it 's most important that i speak with you . please '' - it 's underlined - `` meet me in the ladies ' room . eve . ''
i understand she is now the understudy in there .
i thought you two were in austin , texas . or takes-us , as they say in these parts .
we were . now mr. san pedro sula and i are on our way back to utila , in the morning .
i am right ! i know i 'm right !
well , no one would ever suspect it . you do n't sound right .
i know , i got your message . ray wanted to have dinner . he wanted to talk about the sting we 're plotting . that 's what he calls it . a sting . he 's being real nice to me .
you think he 's got a thing for you ?
your girl 's a menace . here , givver < u > this < /u > ... getter off the street and teach her some < u > humility < /u > .
i do n't < u > think < /u > so ...
cheer up , nigel . it 's not the end of the world .
it may well be . i know how you won that election selena . you ca n't fool me .
we have to be very careful . no sleeping pills , no razor blades . we shut off the gas in her bed- room .
why ? her career ? she got enough out of it . she 's not forgotten . she still gets those fan letters .
yeah . i 've got it here in this bag . i thought i should bring it to you .
yep , that 's right . let 's take a look at it .
would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it ?
oh , i get the idea . yeah , maybe .
... when we consider the lineup of the world , we find there are million people on our side , million on the communist side , and million who are neutral . the odds are to against us ...
he would n't do the makeup . said it was for queers .
this ai n't a little feud , earl , it 's world war two !
they 're coming around for another pass . you got extra weapons and ammo ?
i think i 'll cut out here , chief . i got ta get home .
get home my ass . we 're going to the office , have another drink . i want some company tonight .
how 's the rest of the gang ? you seen anyone ?
well , sammy 's dead . yeah , fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him . had twenty-five grand in his pocket .
i confide in you and rely on you more than anyone i 've ever known ! to say a thing like that now - without any reason - when i need you more than ever ...
i hope you mean what you say , eve . i intend to hold you to it .
on my life , i promise you i will .
if you 're lying , i 'll hunt you down and kill you myself .
you 're firing me ? ? you do n't even pay me !
look -- i do n't wan na seem insulting . but ... your act is like amateur hour : singalongs ... puppets ... playing records ...
'are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense ? '
it 's her father 's grey matter that 's weakened if you ask me . how can i ask superman such a dumb question .
yes , everybody < u > is < /u > in love with john bubber . the whole country , in fact . and they 're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence ...
`` harassed . '' cause i yelled at him when he 's riding in his limo ? the guy 's a thief , he took my ...
actually , i was always partial to roy rogers . i really dug those sequined shirts .
do you really think you have a chance against us , mr. cowboy ?
uncle , you must n't think that i wo n't be sad to leave you .
it 's up to you entirely . do n't leave , then ...
it 's not his fault , evan . you knew how bad he had it when we were kids .
do n't give me this oprah-book club bad upbringing shit , because you turned out fine .
i admire you , general . how do you keep command of your men amidst such madness ?
i am strong , paul , like a lion .
thing that bothers me now , though , looking back is that i really think i could have been something ... special .
thinking like that is only gon na drive you nuts you were a great star and you had a good run . that oughta be enough .
did your wife send you up here to spy on me ?
what ? no ! do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something ?
did n't know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe .
that 's just mean . oh . jody wanted to know if i could get her some .
the only realty i see is that i 'm a prisoner on my own ship . what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew ?
i do n't control minds . i free them .
so the method of death is the only connection ?
no . there 's more . there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat .
if you 're going to marry a warrior , you 'd best get used to it .
i have no intention of getting used to it .
you did n't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she would n't let you near her with a ten foot pole , which is , by the way , about nine feet , nine inches off the mark anyway .
that 's true . oh , god , lotte , what have i become ? my wife in a cage with a monkey . a gun in my hand . betrayal in my heart .
so tell me , do you like ron ? is it serious ?
come on , linda . it 's just sex .
[ he has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back . he is part of the brotherhood . ]

do n't you expect me to be a little hurt ?
mrs. robinson , you stand there and tell me i 'm not good enough for your daughter .
because is not democrash ? all peoples created equal ?
hey , you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging bible !
you 're quite the wordsmith , fiddle boy . but nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment .
if you 're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion , then i for one am fully prepared to do so ... al fresco .
kirk-unit , < u > why < /u > do you not disclose information ?
because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet .
have you been exposed to a loud noise recently , or did you have a virus ?
no , i-i 've been perfectly healthy . you know me .
if you could pick the shrimp off , as well as anything that touches the shrimp ...
i 'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate .
either you go to sleep or i 'll come in there and put you out .
you 're gon na be sorry you did n't listen to me .
you disapprove of me when i 'm like this , do n't you ?
not exactly . sometimes , though , i wish i understood you better .
but you were among the british , they were your friends - why betray them ?
is that what you thought ? that i betrayed the british ? the british betrayed me . the british betrayed me .
sure ... i figured i 'd see you sometime ...
hopin ' you could tell me if there 's a contract out on me . i really need to know .
can you watch gideon for a while ? one of the girls is going into labor . junior is going to drive me over .
you just run along . i 'll fix him his soup . he will be all right .
not me . i was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical .
look , would it make you feel better if i did n't want you to do this ?
do n't be too sure . just because i wear a uniform -- that does n't make me a girl scout .
miss kubelik , one does n't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he 's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as i 'm concerned , you 're tops . i mean , decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise . cheers .
i do n't know . i 'm not sure .
well , think about it . is n't it possible ?
no , no i do n't . are you sure ?
of course . in fact , i 'm there right now .
you heard me . wan na make something out of it , private ?
not with an officer , no , sir . the m.i . does n't mint stupid cap troopers .
she was the only `` annie '' you could find ?
they only made a handful . we 're lucky there 's even one living in the area ...
sir ! ... might i inquire if general webb has heard from colonel munro 's daughters ? i was to rendezvous with them in albany and escort them to the fort .
yes . you may . you there . what does munro call you ? the `` scotsman '' has sent one of his indian allies to guide you .
the later events have never been kept a secret .
where am i ? and how can i leave ?
i 'd be trying to get the best deal that i could .
maybe that 's what i 'm doing . can i reach in my pocket , show you something ?
here i am , patrizia . i 'm always here .
claudia is n't coming with us . will you please take care of her luggage ? thanks .
i 'd like to have a talk with him .
it 's no use , dad . i practically threw myself at him .
well , this sounds like a lady i 'd like to have a word with . so everything 's set for tomorrow ?
right . everything 's the same , except one change ...
you do n't seem very disturbed by it . i 've always thought voodoo was something to be scared of : the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened .
i 'm afraid it 's not very frightening . they have their songs and dances and carry on and finally , as i understand it , one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people .
i 'd love to stop somewhere but i 'm late . i 'm on my way to see viktor now .
no , i understand . that 's what i want to talk about . i do n't know if you know this , simone , but viktor and i were married once .
you should have seen this girl . she lit up the room .
i do n't care if helen of troy walked into that bar ! that 's game six of the world series !
i 'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up .
the universe is a living creature , like you and me , madmartigan .
okay . indo-china . tuesday . we 'll pick you up .
that 's more like it . goodnight , old buddy .
jimmy , my daddy 's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that ...
okay , okay , just tell me what 's the trouble .
no -- it is n't . a cop died today and the other is barely holding on . i want some answers , nash .
i 'm sorry about that -- but i had nothing to do with it .
maybe . i do n't know . seems more likely becker does , but at the very least she knows how i died .
let 's see if they have an address for becker . i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with .
edward , these women here , i do n't think any of 'm like the guys they 're with . they 're just into it for the money .
i 'm sure that 's true for some of them .
the implication being that i have not been reading them as written .
to the best of my recollection , neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation .
then perhaps you can help me . i 've lost someone who ...
we know that too . you 've come to the right place .
i mean it -- you leave everything to me -- i 'm going to be your own personal dating service !
i appreciate the offer but you really do n't --
he belongs with those reptiles , louis . he deserved to die .
then maybe so do we . every night of our lives . he was my brother . my maker . he gave me this life , whatever it is .
and there 's hope for you too , charlie . tomorrow i bet you sell a half-dozen policies .
thanks , brother . but the fact is , i got ta pull up stakes temporarily .
the only thing i want to hear is your silence .
i must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison . you know , we have so much in common  we have such history together i 've been thinking we should become friends .
course i ca n't do much `` wriggling '' if you tie me up like that again . massey -- this is one bad bad little girl .
we 'd better go before we get thrown out .
yes , but carefully . i 'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care . scottie --
i can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you . they 're dependable , good boys --
i thought you said we were going to be friends .
i ca n't handle it . i ca n't keep my feelings bottled up like you . can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me ? ... tell me !
she was swimming at the ymca pool when it happened . died mid-backstroke .
i have n't seen her in almost two years .
what are we doing ? ray , i was ready to kill you .
do n't you see ? it 's the slime . that stuff is like pure , concentrated evil .
the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure , if he decided to make peace with the emperor , at least at this time .
for the sake of your argument , let us say that is correct .
just a spoiled brat of a rich man . you and westley 'll make an ideal team .
will you please tell me what you 're raving about !
hey , man , tonight i 'm going to teach ray about jazz .
good , that 'll put him to sleep early . no offense .
come on , just get to the message board !
i 'm trying , i ca n't find a canadian server ... i 've got to break into the main frame ...
do n't ever put your hands on me , mr. gordon .
you 're talking about a goddamned ticket , from when i passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something ?
we had a court-martial in your absence . they wanted to put a bullet in your head . i pleaded for clemency . said we should find out what happened first . so what did happen ?
he ran . i could n't shoot him in the back . i tried to catch him . he made it to the road and got hit by a saracen .
warn me ? will you get out of here , you meat loaf ?
i 'm a grisly sight , it 's true ; but i love you and that 's why i 'm here . you 've got to know .
yeah , the cowboy . this guy , the cowboy , wants to see you . jason said he thought it would be a good idea .
oh , jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the cowboy . should i wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters ?
you must come in first place to move on !
jesus , my legs are asleep . i 'll never be able to win this shit .
we do n't see too many lady homicide detectives . you have < u > my < /u > respect . have you discussed the note with dr. hudson ?
someone broke into her place last night . it was n't connected to our case , but it shook her up pretty bad so i have n't ...
i heard the same sound at ladysmith , at nukden , port arthur . what do you expect after a battle ?
you were at those battles as a spectator   i wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me  those men out there  dead or dying  by my order -- because i willed it so .
jesus christ , stanley , you ca n't go to the bathroom now . you have exactly one minute before we 're back on the air , this is not the time to go to the bathroom .
i 'm , i need to go , i 'm gon na --
come on , heathcliff , i 'll walk you to the corner .
yes , ma'am . but my name is adam .
yeah , well i do n't know much about chemistry , but even if this stuff works , you better find it by midnight . otherwise it 's -
yeah , i know . back to the eiffel tower . and what about you ?
indeed , the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own . some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
do n't speak to me in absolutes . the evidence is contestable .
brad , what would you say if i asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the cruising vessel and get rid of them at work ?
i 'd say ... who the hell is ron johnson ?
a party ? mom 's gon na kill you . then me .
do n't be so self-righteous . it 's just a little blow out -- we 'll be perfectly safe .
that 's what i said . now , lis- ten to me . i want you to help me take this woman down stairs . i will give her a shot . you can take care of her till i get help .
how about me getting the help . she 's quiet now , is n't she ?
all i know is he came by the barber shop , all fuckin ' undone , wanting to know where you were staying in vegas . i told him i do n't know . i still do n't .
how 'd he know i was in vegas ? you tell him ?
i like it better when i 'm on top .
cecile . this is what i like to call quiet time . this is time when we reflect on what we 've done .
i did n't . that was mozart . wolfgang amadeus mozart . you know who that is ?
of course . the man you accuse yourself of killing .
it 's a free country , we can look at you if we want to .
yes but i get tense and i feel like i ca n't be myself if that happens .
they keep saying there 's nothing i could 've done . that 's a lie . i could 've done something . if only i 'd paid attention to my feelings .
you 're not trained for that . none of us are ... i mean , sometimes i ... okay , let 's say you had gone back . what then ? are you bulletproof ?
it 's all right with me . is he here ?
my name 's holly ... holly in ancient times they said my number was unlucky . do you believe in luck ?
repartee , dick -- very good . hey , i feel ten years younger ! it makes a helluva difference , let me tell ya ! how 's the lawyer life ?
never made so much money in my life . but my upbringing does n't allow me to enjoy it . i did get to argue a case before the supreme court .
virginia , when you 're in this car , you 're not my wife , you 're my deputy .
well , this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the sheriff .
forget about that . you run if you want to , but you 're not taking this car .
claude , man , i 'm serious . give me those keys .
everything is double the price now , you do understand that ?
i need rice , beans , beer , and your best whiskey .
it 's only a matter of time before my mom has him burned too !
what has the world come to ? this is horrible . we 're locked up , burning books , hating other people-
one that will ask the questions you want asked .
one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect .
ah believe ya , brother . ah believe ya !
now , would n't you pray for twenty bucks , a bottle booze an ' a piece of that angel cake ?
not bad -- for a cowboy -- you 're okay , you 're okay .
what i 'm gon na do , i 'm gon na make a cowboy outta you , kid . how about that ? build you up a little , teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud , rat-stuff .
i knew it ! i knew a night 's rest was n't possible in this house ! hubert !
wha -- ? yes , sweetheart -- wha -- ?
... the coroner 's report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs .
hollie was always fond of tide-pools . you know what he used to say about them ?
that 's a first . most people praised me for it .
most people are morons . i mean who are you to knock what you 've never experienced ?
a fine mess this is ... horrid , nipping creatures ... what do we now , jack ?
defend ourselves . we 've bested far worse already .
that was three years ago after that first party !
look , miles , all i know is i 'm an actor . all i have is my instinct . my intuition -- that 's all i have . and you 're asking me to go against it . and that 's just wrong .
there you gotrustin ' people again . how many times did i tell you
he looked like an upright young feller to me , ma .
hey , come on , you ca n't believe that voodoo . sharks do n't commit murder . they do n't pick out a person ... .
it picked sean ... it killed your father ... .
i need to know what you know about this guy .
do n't go out there . you ca n't win . we need to get off this ship . that 's all there is to it .
that 's what this is all about ? tell me , who 's gon na use your lousy freeway ? we got the red cars , the best public transportation in the country .
not for long . we 're retiring the red cars . people will drive , mr. valiant , because they 'll have to . and when they drive , they 'll have to buy our cars , our tires , our gasoline .
but dad , you guys truly hated each other , i mean really hated each --
-- waiter ! where 's my cobb salad ? you want advice ben ? if your big brother were still alive i 'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head . look kid , you married that woman against my advice --
pierre ... that 's his name ? pierre ? is he french ?
no , he 's not ... listen i do n't want to talk about him . that 's a whole other headache . i called because i heard you might be moving back to queens ...
i do n't believe i 've seen you at any of our services before .
that 's because i 've been on the wagon .
she talked him into it . she wanted everything .
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money . that must have made you pretty angry ?
i 've located the suspect zero file . did you know there was one ? koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation .
[ do n't jerk a jerk-off . there 's nothing in the bureau mainframe . ]
what ! ? so you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us ! ? no way ! that 's my god damn truck !
let me make this clear ; if we stay , we die !
well then that 's not exactly dating is it .
vada , i know that traditionally you 're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you 're officially married ... but these are very , very special circumstances .
a beach named x ? that i 'd like to see .
so there you have it . i guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ?
do n't like her ? what 's wrong with her ? she 's beautiful ... she 's rich ... she 's got huge tracts of land ...
i know ... but ... i want the girl that i marry to have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
and i still get my money . i need some cash right now . you ca n't just put me in the street .
i 'll get your cash . you have n't been straight with me ever since i met you ! you never loved me in the first place ! i need eyes in the back of my fuckin ' head with you , you fuckin ' bitch !
caesar , stop acting like an asshole and think --
do n't try to tell me what to do .
it 's true ... but a first contract , it 's an exception .
and ... may i kiss you , like in the movies , may this be an exception ?
not now ... i do n't want to think about it --
come on , lenny . you used to be good at this stuff . play it down . what 's the perp doing ?
so what 's the prognosis , fertile myrtle ? minus or plus ?
i do n't know . it 's not ... seasoned yet . wait . huh . yeah , there 's that pink plus sign again . god , it 's unholy .
hey , you did n't read `` death in venice '' till i bought it for yuh .
that 's right , that 's right . you only gave me books with the word `` death '' in the titles .
captain , do n't assume he 's anything like you are . you should resist the urge to think you know him .
i not only know him , deanna , i am him.. and he is me !
dartmouth 's too big and too expensive . if he 's as good as i think he is , he can move into the big league later . but androscoggin first .
we 'll need room . the sixth rib goes .
'course i am -- but does n't mean i wo n't leave you here . if you believe anything about me , better be that .
no , you see , i < u > promised < /u > them ... i have to ... i have to go and ... .
you mean you want us to make copies of yentl , fiddler on the roof , and chaim potok 's the chosen ?
that 'll work . get them out to the jewish community stat . we got an epidemic on our hands .
is there any sort of risk of brain damage ?
well , technically , the procedure itself is brain damage , but on a par with a night of heavy drinking . nothing you 'll miss .
is there any truth to what he 's saying , pike ?
what difference does it make ? natchez was better off without winston hancock ! who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing ? at least the state of mississippi got years of cheap labor out of the deal !
did you ask walter to get you a shrink ? barry , did you ask walter to get you a shrink ? what 's wrong with you ? are you ok ?
i did n't ask him that . he 's lying .
so ? do n't you want to make ronald a happy pappy ? practice makes perfect , cecile . my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible .
but that would make me a slut . would n't it ?
so , how did your conference go with gordon ?
the conference , oh yeah . fine . we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us .
for one night in your life , do you think it 's possible for us to be completely real ?
all right , you want to be real ? so tell me why did you dump me ?
it 's okay . i probably would n't talk to me either .
i 'm sorry . it 's not up to me .
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me .
guys like me , huh . well , listen , even though i 've been celibate lately , i 'm not gon na force myself on you . i 've never done that in my life .
it 's convenient to fake looking for something right now , is n't it ?
i 'm not faking anything . i 'm looking for some bath oil ...
we 've already played our cards , major . there 's no turning back .
we ca n't jump from here or at this speed . but if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane ...
the airport . trying to get on the plane for the states .
could be ten or fifteen . maybe even twenty .
basquiat , those are my best clothes ! ! ! what are you doing ?
c'mon , baby , i painted them for you . they 're beautiful now .
new way ? what 's this about a new way ? there 's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back , and no error . let me hear more .
well , we go round shop crasting and the like , coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each .
i 'm not sure . but i think they 're worried about you .
it 's the kids , you know , not jeremy . he had nothing to do with this -- except pay , of course . he 's always willing to pay . he 's extremely generous . i 'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me .
ev , it 's not my fault ! i 'm trying to tell you this incredible --
it 's never your fault , bernie ! never ever ! you screwed up my life , now you 're gon na screw up joey 's life , but you 're never gon na accept responsibility for anyth --
yup . hey , so i heard you dropped in on tran last night . another slick lenny move .
he 's in this somehow ... i do n't know how . just stay close to faith .
that 's disgusting ! this is the largest , meanest , most vicious shark ever landed off amity island , and a known maneater !
let 's just cut him open and see what 's inside ...
im an american and in america , people sue . so to prevent a lawsuit , i baked a tart . and i dont bake .
so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door , i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches .
you can send somebody with me if you do n't believe me !
i was n't born yesterday . now the boys tell me you and this mollie malloy --
that 's my fault . i get too worked up at these . i 'm very method . you do know ... that 's not my name .
i did n't know what else to call you .
they 'll be looking at you . they do n't know who you are .
that 's right , they 're wondering , who 's this guy ? you do n't tell 'em . understand , harry ? do not tell 'em who i am .
it 's amazing , us running into each other like this . maybe it 's fate .
maybe not . i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy , solid math , a little wild on the stick , but a natural . when it turned out it was you , i made sure we 'd run into each other ...
what do you want here , ma ? you could of watched it on tv .
my god , sonny - you oughtta see - alla brooklyn is here ! on all networks !
i 'll be fine ... are you a writer , mr fink ?
yes i am . i 'm working on a wres  please call me barton .
we 'd never make it . they 're probably all over the road .
we have to try it . we ca n't stay here . melanie needs help . mother , the house wo n't take another attack .
diner up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .
i 'll be back in a couple of hours . and be careful with her , will you ?
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr. blaine . i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly .
if rick has the letters , he 's much too smart to let you find them there .
hey , what 's this ? wearing papa 's things ? now that 's cute . that 's what i call real lovey-dovey . yessir .
if you do n't get out of here , i 'll slap that fresh mouth of yours .
plank road . yes sir . that 's up a ways . mile , maybe .
you do n't know her ? judy ? works in the slaughterhouse .
you 're daft . what 's gray to me . he 's only a man from whom i buy what i need when i need it -- the rest is forgotten .
you may deny the devil , toddy , but you 'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead .
because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings .
oh , yes , well , you know , when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first . it 's not like it 's been marked down or anything .
i did n't say that . it 's just that right now ...
i do n't know what i 'd do if she would n't go out with me ...
so far i 've been told i can cooperate and get probation , maybe . or , i can stand mute and get as much as five years . does that sound right ?
i 'd say if you 're tried and found guilty you wo n't get more than a year and a day . that 's state time . prison .
sir , i speak to you as a kindred intellect . do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the federation ?
i am not certain such speculations are included among your duties , lieutenant .
boss , the way i see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere , bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced .
i hope you 're right , but my guts are telling me different .
do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster ?
faster and faster . for a long time you would n't feel anything . then you would burst into fire ... forever .
i know . i had to take the day to think .
yeah , i tried you at home . did you get my message ?
i 've got it all under control , jerry . you can go now .
under control ? you idiot . you did n't know who he was ?
that 's because it was a challenge . you has control over you 're situation . it was hard , but you rose to it .
okay . i 'll think about that . bye .
no , there 's no problem , dr. helburn just needs to have his oil changed .
oh i see , 'cause usually that does n't require such a lengthy consultation .
i did n't like her , angie . i do n't feel like calling her up .
well , what do you feel like doing tonight ?
it 's huge . this musta been a grand old place at one time .
let 's get fed , sweetheart . the light 's fadin ' fast .
something smells so rich . my stomach is heaving -
he came back , he says he caught a rabbit . i 'm cooking it .
i ca n't help feeling that i 'm cheating when i take them .
it 's genetics . you know this . you know where it comes from . there is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires .
the last entry read , bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight . bruce insists . i made them go out . i made them take me to the movie . to that theater ... it was my fault . i killed them .
oh god , bruce , you were a child . you were n't responsible .
imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake , never gets tired , never shows up to work with a hangover . meet the pilot .
why did you marry me , miles ? why did we have these two children ? you do n't need us . your heart and your mind are in here . but it does n't love you like we do .
if i could do you think i 'd be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else ?
somewhere else ? mister , somewhere else is fifty miles from here . only other gas station down in town closed years ago when the mine got shut ...
sir , i 've got an overload in disposal unit four .
you better check on it , mr. dunn . i 'll stay here and fly the ship .
it 's okay . the guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store . he had it coming .
you expect me to believe what , that someone came in here last night . gave that guy ... something that stopped his heart ?
that 's funny . i need to talk to you , too . perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room , professor tripp .
i do n't believe i know where the upstairs guest room is .
if i 'm gon na blow this up -- i need hard proof .
but it 's so much easier when we make it up .
if he heard you talking like that he 'd make you walk the plank . three , two , one . now it 's your turn , spin .
a-ha ! you landed on candyland ! now swallow it !
but o'brien does n't even use that office . the democrats 've moved to miami . there 's nothing there !
it was just a fishing expedition . apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc .
there 's nothing we can do . it 's just a matter of time before they unlock this room . there goes my model . there goes our last refuge .
we 're not going to wait here like cornered animals . i can tell you that . we need help . i 'm going to talk to that little girl .
your spanish is good enough . you certainly look the part .
you 're crazy . people would hire a has-been , ray ? a drunk ?
if you 're saying all this just because you do n't want to tell me the truth , because you 're hiding something from me , then maybe i can understand --
there 's nothing i 'm hiding . it 's just that --
i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that 's what i would 've done .
maybe you 're more one of us than you think ... sir .
i know who you are , doctor venkman . busting any ghosts lately ?
no , that 's what i want to talk to the mayor about . we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued , screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you .
i just do what the doctor says , babe .
you 're just comfortable , that 's all . you do n't even ask to go home . you just lie around , let your mama take care of you .
it might be paranoia , but i 've never lost my keycard before .
'paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured . '
well , sure , if you are , margaret ...
anyway , we want to get this letter off .
oh , untrue , jeffster . i think , uh , two weeks ago we attended a concert where i had fucked two girls .
hey , it 's me . no , that 's , that 's the ultimate liar of liars .
you 'd better talk good , son , because , for the moment , i 've got a quite bad opinion about you . norman smiles .
i respect your business , mister tony . every time we asked your help , we were very happy with the result . it 's right this that makes me nervous , now . i hope you 'll excuse my temporary bad mood ?
what do you mean so to speak ? ! audrey , how long have you been his ... secretary ?
barton , i think we should concentrate on our little project-
you stupid punk ! you came < u > that < /u > close , < u > that < /u > close ! !
one of these days , melvin , somebody 's gon na kick your ass .
actually , stu , julie does n't get to decide . that 's why she was having the nightmare . < i > < /i > they 're pulling the plug at nine am .
nine am ! but that 's - < u > twelve hours < /u > .
and cherry bombs ... ash cans ... and rockets ?
ok. for another $ a special on the packs .
do you want to come in for a minute ? we could talk about --
when i freaked out at the pub ? that was nothing , just nerves . dont worry about it .
my god . you 've got to call the police , tell them it was an accident . where is she ?
she 's in the desert . she 's out in the desert .
ah , good evening , my dear duroc . i 'm afraid i 've been out hunting and i have had a rather bad fall .
indeed you have , ambassador . have you sent for a doctor ?
you do n't have to do this to impress me .
if i might remind you , sir , the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
p6 chip . triple the speed of the pentium .
yeah . it 's not just the chip , it has a pci bus . but you knew that .
i called her sister , mr. lowery , where she works , the music makers music store , you know ? and she does n't know where mary is any more than we do .
you better run out to the house . she may be ... unable to answer the phone ...
i 'm sorry we had to take the stairs . it was just that horrible little elevator boy ...
not at all . you 're light as a feather .
i take it this is the bastard you told me about . why the hell are you beating on him ?
so he 'll tell us who the fuck set us up .
and we know which lebowski you are , lebowski .
yeah . jackie treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat lebowski .
do n't be thinking i 'm happy about this , elizabeth . but i see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which i can do nothing about .
not when you can drink instead , at least .
i 've never met anyone like you , betty .
i know , that 's why we were meant to be together ...
the guy from near where christie used to live ?
no . the other one . the one who disappeared up the block from christie . the one they made a beef on .
we just had a funeral , is n't that what it means in england as well ?
what it means in england -- and in scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands . we were ambushed last night . but the scots dragged their dead away .
best everything , joe . but i 'm going to dance with you .
dance ? you do n't dance ! you learn to dance ? ?
hey ... popeye 's chicken is ass kickin ' !
it sure is . now eat it up . you 're gon na need your energy .
i did exist . i do exist . i 'm the same person !
the person i cared about would n't have done this . everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie . i do n't know you at all . for all i know you could hate dorothy parker .
pause as he takes all this in i think your dad would miss you .
no he would n't , i ca n't go home .
i told you we do n't know for certain .
then we do n't know that god was white .
it 's a name . mr. wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht . he 's the proud owner of an alliance security package . he also paid a visit to the morgue to see john michael kane .
what does that mean ? jason , what does that mean ? jason , please ... who is he ?
that 's up to your guy on the boat . seven o'clock tomorrow night , at the east dock . make sure he got it right .
i was wondering , how are you planning to beat the security ?
you would n't have time anyway . we come to a roadblock , they 'll run the car , find out in five seconds who it belongs to .
if they get set up in time , which i doubt . and even if they do they 'll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas , not a big black guy driving a ford .
he 's landing . he 's got a suitcase on wheels .
so do half the other people in this place . how do i know which one ?
it 's two of the letters in my favorite nurse 's name , annie .
you -- fooler ... ! did i do good ?
you gentlemen feel you have to do this now ?
now 's the perfect time . the animal just fed , so it wo n't stalk us for food . predators do n't hurt when they 're not hungry .
i did n't say i did n't enjoy it .
of course . sorry . i 'm such a fucking asshole .
you 're gon na die here , you know . convenient .
just stick close to chewie and lando . i 've taken care of everything .
i 'll be damned . boy , if you could get ryan to say something about hal phillip walker , would n't that be something ?
well -- maybe . let 's see what happens here .
yeah ? how do i know ? i got ta good mind to plug you . i should n't take any chances on you .
you can trust me , mister . i 'll keep my mouth shut .
what'you see in that guy -- he 's dim , pretty boy . a young , wild ,
young men are uncomplicated . and he 's not `` dim '' . he 's just inexperienced . my job is to give him `` life-wisdom '' and help him make it to the major leagues .
it 's a little late for a wake . she 's been dead nearly a year .
then we 've been away from earth for eighteen months .
yes - if i ca n't convince sophie , i 'll never be able to see tatiana ... .
you 'll convince her . you have the qualities of a princess you 're poised and strong ... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she 'll know .
then a mad millionaire . head of a secret defense establishment . a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
... and by you , mrs. peel . everything points to you . no sisters ? no undiscovered twin ?
c'mon , let 's smoke one of the cigarettes right now . your father 'll never miss it .
i ca n't , dummy . he 'll see that the pack 's been opened . you 're such a dumbhead .
what 's the deal ? did anybody make a decision -
ed , look , uh ... you 're not getting the job . they 're gon na transfer someone from another store to manage this store when i leave to manage the new store . i 'm sorry .
_neurolar_ . it 's a stimulant -- it 's also a serotonin inhibitor . it suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus ... the part of the brain that controls dreaming .
so you think it might counteract krueger 's ability to make us hallucinate ?
well , i guess that 's it -- dead end .
go to bed . you 've got to be at work in the morning . there 's nothing more we can do tonight .
his `` veracity '' was good enough for the state of mississippi .
our standards have to be higher than anyone else 's , because we are the standard ... for everyone else ...
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass .
he 'd let you off at the nearest port , that 's for sure .
well , for one , i read . i do n't watch as much television as you . i 'm trying to feel things more . i 'm learning a lot about people .
what do you read ? what 's the last book you read ?
but we never talked about your fee for bringin ' it to us .
no , but , wade , see , i was bringin ' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in . it 's my deal here , see ?
we should have gone to nassau . at least we could go swimming , lie on the beach .
ah hell we can always do that . listen believe me , once we get to the moon , your tone is going to change .
if that 's true , what about nomak ? he 's been alive longer than the others .
nomak 's different . he 's the carrier . there 's something driving him beyond the thirst . something we 're missing .
that 's a lot of money for a little girl .
it 's for school , for summer writing class .
pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher .
i got nothin ' to preach about no more -- that 's all . i ai n't so sure o ' things .
never ! i 'll get to new york if i have to starve all the way .
must be some strange power westley has over you women . how do you expect to get there ?
why ca n't you just drive me to my old school every morning ?
because you 'd have to get up at five a.m. , would you like that ?
we learn something new about ourselves every day . now . maybe i did n't make myself clear . it is very important that you tell me exactly what captain picard knows .
i told you everything . you might as well just kill me right now .
i 'm not afraid ... i 'm not afraid .
it 's wrong ; so wrong , what we 've done ... .
of course , you do . being magic . then you know i 've got a flu bug , and i turn green and barf profusely when i even think about food . so , all the more meatballs for you . but you know what .
i did . do i have to eat lamb ? daddy did n't cook it , she did .
car insurance costs money . cavities cost money . doritos cost money . i 'm gon na eat that damn bear ... come here !
quit crying . i think we 've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos , here ...
soon , you gorgeous thing ... tell me ... how lonely ?
it 's that call you were expecting , vince .
it 's over , evelyn . it 's all over
touchy , touchy . i 'm sorry i brought the wedding up . let 's just avoid the issue , alright ? now , are we having coffee ?
i am so tired of your bullshit , bernie .
ev , it 's not my fault ! i 'm trying to tell you this incredible --
you blabbed , quaid ! you blabbed about mars !
are you crazy ? ! i do n't know anything about mars .
i 'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly .
how about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick ?
will scraps be able to sit with us , dad ?
we 'll have to check , jimmy . it 's a pretty long trip to mercury .
no . i walked up . do n't ride elevators .
my secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition .
if i talk to you ... y'know ... if i tell you things ... then you 're a lawyer , right ? you ca n't say things , you ca n't tell anyone , it 's like the privelage , right ? attornery-client , you understand ?
not exactly , linda . i 'm not sure where you 're going with this --
yeah , so i better go -- it 's not really the best time to talk ...
what , are you going to like have sex with her on your first date ?
have n't you anyone -- have n't you anybody -- you -- i mean -- are you all alone in the world .
i 'm always alone -- i have been everything .
the shopkeeper on 13th street wo n't drop the lawsuit -- he still claims one of the lasers we fired at the jenkins gang burned down his store..
i hate innocent bystanders . whine , whine , whine . will he settle ?
not really . but if you want me to tone it down ...
no , no . i would n't hire a display designer if i did n't trust her taste . maybe we should bring in more of that shade . perhaps a stripe across the back wall .
overpriced bomb , cost over $ million -- no stars , and no one 's into the horror genre these days anyway . i 'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there . it 's disaster films that are gon na stay at the top .
brilliant . hey , you heading out a little early today ?
scattered reports , sir . rumors . nothing reliable .
desperate times call for desperate measures . get me ant team six .
you 're beginning to sound like mr. kirkeby already .
why not ? now that they 're kicking me upstairs --
that 's right and i 'll smash your face for you , yarblockos . slide of watch shop .
good . it wa your fault ... you sold me a crummy watch . i want my money back .
ca n't you talk to him ? maybe talk him into it . i 'm a real good interviewer . just get me in the room with him .
melvin , go get karl and take him down to the old classroom .
i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for , i 'd have to set up a deal so sweet , they would n't be able to walk away from it .
that 's when he called me . he told me his story and he pitched me a plan .
i ca n't believe we did this . do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days ?
look , i know you think this is irresponsible of me , but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person .
i ca n't name anybody she does like these days .
i see she built a place up here by the river .
... every time you tell that story , you stop there . that 's not how it ended . i was five when my dad got shot .
i know . but that 's how it should have ended . your dad and mom , riding off into a new life , growing old together , happy .
we start with the top and work our way down . we start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go . no need to make the blue collars go crazy .
i disagree . i think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can ... ..
one time i was flying supplies up the amazon . went down in the jungle ... .
you 're not going to tell me , are you ?
jeez , it 's been since , what , kenny 's wedding .
yeah , uh ... so how are you ? what 's going on ?
you do n't have to go this second . you can stay until whenever .
we 've done the hard part now . i might as well , you know ...
was there anything unusual about the driver , dolores driscoll , or the bus that particular morning ?
like what ? i mean , i do n't remember a lot .
i 'll give you anything you want , jake . i think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break .
are you outa your mind ? if i come out , i 'll lose the title .
he 's got your prick in his back pocket , son , and you 're standing naked in the display window of macy 's . he 's using you . only you 're too blind to see it .
no , what i see is a jealous old machinist who ca n't stand that his son 's become more successful than himself .
it 's what 's in that sphere , is n't it , harry ? whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it 's going to kill you .
curious , is n't it ? what 's inside ? before i die , i 'd sure like to open it and see .
it 's time to put this person where he belongs .
it 's not necessary , joe . drew 's going to step aside --
why , you might ask ? because you 're ready . because you 've finally gone as far as you can go without it .
if i may , sir ... what exactly are you offering ?
they used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead . really quite a brilliant device , but too flamboyant to seriously produce .
neat . let 's try it out on j.f.k .
i do n't understand it , there were a lot of people there last night , many americans , i believe we should move carefully .
i do n't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public . the lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records , including your own now .
sorry -- i should n't go on about myself at a time like this . are you sure you 're going to be okay ?
yes , just check on me once a day for the next three days . then the pms should be over .
you aspirate the blood from the chest cavity . damn , there 's more of it than i thought .
if we do n't get that pint , he 's in trouble .
i demand to know everything . i do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone i do n't know .
it 's a lousy fifteen kilos . i piss fifteen kilos .
oh my god ! tommy ! stop the pod ! stop the pod !
i ca n't ... it 's on autopilot ! ...
sure ! a bill . senator paine and i decided it was the one way in the world i could make myself --
pardon me . senator paine decided this *with* you ?
well , then i can tell you that in addition to other dangers , there is a grave danger of jacqueline losing her sanity . i would advise against you seeing her .
but why ? she 's been ill -- erratic , but i 've never heard of anything like that !
well i guess we 're neighbors for this trip .
well , so we are . sure is beautiful , huh ?
that 's gon na be tough because dixie mccoy 's dead . the a.i . flatlined him .
i know . you ever work with ghosts , case ?
you do n't call , you do n't write .
this was my first excuse to get away . i ca n't exactly use my cell phone .
i understand bobby beans came to see you today .
yeah . seems maranzano wants to talk about buying the merchant street warehouse .
no , it 's been too long . best to leave things alone .
i 'm on with a friend ! look , i 'd better go . i love you .
i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria .
what they do in austria does n't interest me one little bit . okay ? i have your questionnaire here , gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwängler , born berlin , january orchestral conductor . and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party .
bullets or no bullets , he wo n't do it .
is there any way you could get into his truck ?
a thousand dollars ... and it 's on all night ?
of course it is howard . that 's why they call it a marathon .
do not confuse yourse { fi why ? we must strike a heavy blow . this can not be a war of manoeuvre .
so attack is your defence . well let 's hope cetshwayo will offer his impis full destruction .
maybe i was there , but i did n't see anythin ' . all i know 's that trash killed a man with his bare hands . hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby !
marietta , settle down now darlin ' ... i want what 's best for her , too - like i said , i 'll do what i can to bring her home .
whoa , whoa , whoa . i said i 'd drop you home , but i 'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds . i 've already pulled twelve hours today .
come on , mace . this is gon na be a big night . ca n't you feel it ? the energy in the air ? there 's money to be made , dreams to sell .
now you finish locking up , will you , carl ?
i will . then i am going to the meeting of the --
wow ... stop giving them away . i got an invitation to model for comme de garcons ... you wan na do it with me ?
yeah  i 'd do that ... you could teach me .
really , why do n't you go sit down somewhere ?
i like to work . i do n't mind work . it 's the least i can do after all you and mr. hillyer have done for me . you 're so sweet . there never was nobody like you .
little miss , you 're stopping me in my work .
but i want to talk to you . mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me . i 've got to take back this ring .
i know i must have had something to do with the palace - i 've had little flashes of things - but being the princess ? it does n't matter as long as i find my home .
well , the only thing you 've got when you 've got a home is a fear of losing it ! you 're lucky you do n't remember the revolution -- i never had much , but what i did have -- i lost .
ss'loka ' . it means literally `` small but intelligent creature '' . it loses much in the translation .
and what was that one about my mother ? that was a good one .
i thought i gave orders the regiment was to drill .
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking .
i disagree . i think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can ... ..
look , miss . i know you 're still upset about that incident in chicago , but understand , this is a cut throat business . we do n't have time to play nursemaid to every single tom dick and harry .
i 'm a push-over for whom ? what is it ? who 's on the phone ?
yes , mr. fielding - you 'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what 's that you said ? oh - zowie ! i 'll give her the message .
this is a dead end . you took us into a dead end !
i just thought you wanted to get away . i did n't know you wanted to go someplace .
he took it like a man . toss him in that drainage ditch .
there 's a taxi stand here . i can meet you .
our best scientific minds already have . we ca n't find any other way to do this .
then the son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do ...
you ca n't ride with me . the surprise effect is ninety percent of it .
well , i 'm sorry , man , but i ai n't gittin ' in that trunk .
guys . we 're doing it right , here . $ prime rib ? nobody does that in michigan . nobody .
the tribe is concerned that many of your ... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues .
cohaagen knows it makes air . but the bastard wo n't turn it on .
of course not . if mars had an atmosphere , he 's lose control .
is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in las vegas ?
that is not true . i own some stock in some of the hotels , but only very small amounts . i also own some american telephone and ibm stock .
i told you she was n't especially attractive , but that she had a good deal of charm , and she 's really a real nice girl ...
she 's all right , andy . it 's just that i get one saturday night off every three weeks , and i was expecting something better , that 's all .
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool . i see a power void to be filled . as we have the most power , we may move with impunity .
i see . i 'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight .
i want to talk to both you guys about greta . and ...
i 'm very fucking sorry , but greta is dead today . could we interest you in someone else ?
with all due respect , the enterprise is a disaster . there must be other ships in the quadrant .
other ships , yes . but no experienced commanders . captain , i need jim kirk .
ok. ok. but now that i 've got a job , i'11 probably stop going ...
do n't do that ... sooner or later you 'll be left empty-handed .
no -- just there -- on the first level . do n't look for us . we 'll see you .
you do n't seem quite sure , jessica . can you do it ? will you ?
they know . it 's the scent . we better split 'em up .
i have a better idea , let 's run it out of them !
if you wo n't take me to dinner with your parents , i wo n't meet you at the motel .
lynette , i told you already , it wo n't work .
i 'm glad you care about us , kicks . sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
maybe there ought to be less racket and more us .
now i am truly embarrassed . forgive me . i should not have asked such a stupid question . i know you are a very important man and ...
no . do n't be silly . it 's just ...
yeah , man , my manager and my lawyer .
well , just , you know , have 'em call me . y-you know where to find me , right ?
you signed for five years -- so four years , seven months .
okay ... i 'll go back . but just let them know , first they ai n't gettin ' latka . they 're gettin ' tony !
jesus christ , what were you doing in there ?
get the shotgun . and her purse . i 'd like to know who she is .
tch , well , you know , eventually it , it is going to happen to all of us .
yes , but does n't that ruin everything for you ? that makes everything ...
because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the `` enquirer '' in his pocket ?
- and that copy of the `` enquirer '' said the president should be killed .
so what 's the problem ? girls do that all the time .
i ca n't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything . if it 's my kid , too , then i 've got a responsibility , do n't i ?
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin ' bullet that i saw him take . so do n't be calling him a rat .
look , asshole , i 'm right ! somebody 's a fuckin ' rat . how many times do i hafta say it before it sinks in your skull ?
hey , you 're always saying , 'bring me real life . bring me street life . and , like , one man 's mundane and desperate existence is another man 's technicolor . '
i said that ? look , i 'll take it for five , and you 'll make out okay , because in this case it 's pure cream , you do n't have to cut anything back to the wearer .
yeah , but it ai n't doing us any good . the way this is set up , i ca n't run shit unless i get inside its perimeter ... and this goddamn thing would see me comin ' from a mile away .
you can make your move when it comes after me .
charley vidal says ! do n't throw charley vidal up to me !
charley 's my friend . i need friends . why are you afraid to have me as your friend ?
well , thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you .
you 're great at taking the edge off a good time .
listen . `` studsy '' burke told me you used to be o.k . that 's why i 'm here . do they ... .
how is studsy ? i did n't know he was out of stir .
uh , actually , i tend to shy away from that kind of thing .
excuse me for asking , but you are n't married , are you ?
do n't touch me . he 's got ... got into my head .
you want to be like that , swann ? mud and shit ?
the bank owns it . but i 'm working on it .
jeez , i 've never owned anything . i have n't even had a room of my own since i was fifteen years old .
has anything been simple so far ? from the look of the shovel , we dig .
oh , adam . i do n't have gloves . my nails keep getting longer . i 'll break them .
i should n't say this , but you 're pretty , gabrielle . it 's unprofessional , i know .
really ? i always think myself so ugly . no , not ugly , but plain . a wallflower .
ohhh yes . no , no . just a little , you know ... we 're fine .
well , i 'm glad . pardon my intrusiveness , but we do have to stick together you know .
do n't take all day at that table , david lee .
mama , when kin me and earl go to school with david lee ?
yeah , ye -- i -- uh , there were , earlier , there was that guy carrut --
-- agent carruthers . do you know where is he now ?
well , it 's quite a place , your `` ashram '' -- is that right ?
that 's right . the word only means `` community . '' but it could stand for `` village '' ... or the world .
yeah . i suppose i could . but , walter --
he 's going to have you the rest of his life , hildy . ca n't you give me another hour ?
have n't i seen you up in ladies ' wear ?
i do n't work here . my wife does .
i 'm lost , boss . what are we saying here ?
we 're saying that when oswald went to russia , he was not a real defector , that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died , that 's what we 're saying .
yeah  yeah . . . sure i will .
now , let 's hear from you . . .
your mother said that you 've been skipping cycles of your medication .
i 've been taking it . i just like to make her feel guilty for all of this . you know , abuse her . psychologically .
relax . if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert .
they would n't do it in front of all these people . they 'd send someone later , when we 're alone .
now ned 's a hell of a shot with a rifle . hell , he can hit a bird in the eye flyin ' .
better'n you anyhow , kid . you was n't comin ' close .
foley made me think of that fella carl tillman , the one you were seeing , it turns out the same time he was doing banks . you recall that ?
when i was seeing carl tillman , i did n't know he robbed banks .
cole , listen to me ... i 've got to tell you ...
you know , when you dumped me for that wimp , i thought , cole , she 'll be back . god wants the two of you to be together , and sure enough ...
ellie , get the gun ! try to reach the gun !
i ca n't get it ! i ca n't get it unless i move !
first of all , richard is not a creep . he happens to be an exceptional person . if any of you gave him half a chance , you 'd find that out .
god , peggy , you 're so unformed you 're practically fetal . you 're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends .
were you aware in or that there was a fatal disease out there , called aids , and that you could contract it through sexual activity ?
it 's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv .
i leave it to you , mr. deeds . can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle ?
what kind of wife did you say she was ?
i 'm going to see the diva sing . what 's the matter ? ... do i look bad ?
no , not at all ! i mean , just the opposite , you 're ... you 're beautiful !
he deserves a show . he missed the movie .
i 'm serious , frances . this is important .
it is dangerous to be here . the radio says this is a nest of cockroaches .
i need one last favor . go back and get the twins .
i do n't know , but whatever it is , it 's not the crew .
so where is the rest of the crew ? we 've been over every inch of this ship and all we 've found is blood . dr. weir ? any suggestions ?
it 's new -- have you any idea what you 're saying ?
i was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications , doctor . as a matter of cosmic history , it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
my plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine , thank you .
i can hit those boys from here . we just need a distraction .
`` a habituč of cemeteries , his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior , deceased a dozen years . ''
oh , it 's terrible ! it 's too , too terrible ! well . go on .
shee-it . cough yourself inside out , then light a fag , a goddam fag . you make me puke . where 'd you steal it ? in the movies ?
the coat ? a guy i did a favor once gave it to me . christ .

here 's what you got to do : get your press office , right now . to deny ; there < u > is < /u > no report of albanian activity . they have to deny it . now , get the c.i.a .
i got here as fast as i could . where 's cathy ?
at annie 's house . she 's all right .
as we look up , we see the president biting his lip , and continuing with the speech .
from whence did it come ? our information states it came from a small group of armed , dissidents . of armed and violent dissidents ...
maybe . but you 're also curious about the man . twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him . you were concerned , but you did n't want to show it .
my married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity . i could n't believe it .
i cant believe you want to move back into the city . i thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here ?

she missed `` myriad '' on a vocab test two weeks ago , all right ?
that only proves my point more . the word is a badge for her failures at school .
well , why not ? i 'm feeling magnanimous tonight . the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist . i 'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector .
yeah ? well , do n't expect the toons to give you a gold watch .

the cops are non-negotiable , ippolito . why do n't you just tell me how this space station works .
it 's fool proof , basically . i designed this whole thing myself . every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip . if anything 's moved so much as an inch , we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft .

what do you care ? hey , what smells like shoe polish ?
i 've got a responsibility here . i ca n't let everybody grab free drinks .

i wish i could say the same for myself . i was up thinking about you all night .
i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends .

it could . but the odds of it being any use to us are against it .
cherry-red tears , your first book . i read it at least nine times . and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair .

i woke up in a subway . i do n't know how i got there .
i see . i 'd better stick to running the paper , huh ?
i think maybe you 'd better . and connelli 'd like to have the john doe contract , all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter miss mitchell wrote , for which i gave her a thousand dollars .

my job , unpleasant sometimes , is to know what others do n't want me to know .
not if you have spies in the white house , it is n't your job .
it 's not the girl , jack . sooner or later you would 've tried to take me . you may get me now , but your life wo n't be worth a dime .
i 've died once already . it was n't so bad -- in fact i recommend it .
you get her ? okay . well , i need a lot . i need more than usual .
well , why do n't you take it out of your account ? there 's a lot there .
sorry , did n't mean to startle you . you did n't give me a chance to knock .

`` wickwire , thomas dane '' ... second run at coronado ... and correct , they had him stashed in the `` appropriation liaison office , '' whatever that is .

i do n't believe i know where the upstairs guest room is .

oh , god , i forget . yes . yes . you go . poor thing , you ought to get out .
look out for her . she 's tougher than you think .
ah , what else indeed ? let me put it another way : how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at feet by feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water ?
that 's easy : inches . we carry stuff that big in stock .
i was never much of a sweater . you know that .
look , vi , i do n't blame you . you feel you feel pity now . the pleasure is n't there any more . the kinkiness has gone ... you 've become kind .
but i 'm surprised you 're still working for her , unless she 's suddenly come up with another husband .

what if i want to talk about her , pard ? what then ? you know , that 's all i 've ever heard from you , since i was a kid ... you never want to talk about that , man , and it 's important .
yeah ? and what else am i supposed to do ? there 's no baby anymore , and if she wants to throw away her life , that 's her business .
she 's just a kid . there 's time for more babies later . after she grows up .
any major operation is dangerous . however , as we know from her previous illness , she 's a very strong girl .
well , if it is n't malignant and she can get through the operation all right , it might be better than her really being pregnant . she does n't even know who the father might have been .
sal , if you want me to deliver any faster , get me a jet rocket or something , cuz i ca n't run with pizzas , all the cheese ends up on one side and shit .
i did n't say nuthin ' . you must have a guilty conscience . what are you guilty of ?
if they can give kissenger the peace prize , i would n't be surprised to wake up and find i 'd won the preakness .

please check . is it full ? please could you check .
jay ... how 's it coming on the repairs ?
well ... i 'm going to have to blow the engines out ...
i told her i would if she would give me time .
i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof , you would have rebuilt the whole damn house .
i had it impounded . come on , we 'll use it for haulin ' you back to the slam .
back to jail in my own car . ganz got away . got all my money . it just do n't seem right .
i 've got news for you . it 's not working .

we were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
what 's what ? oh , that . just a little going away present .
real diamonds . they must be worth their weight in gold . are you always this generous ?
and if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the federation . i ca n't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions .
all i have is my personal feelings . i was n't raised with the ideals of the federation . but i 'm trying to understand them now . to live up to them . to live up to you .
i thought i was gon na have an attack . go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou . childs could tell i was n't right .
just safety your shit and get behind me , okay ? i 'll take care of this .
yes , i do . you 're right . i ca n't just let him go free . besides , i can help you from the inside .

you know , monsieur mercier , this is all non-sense .
these may have been the jewels of the duchess swana , but , like all private property , they were confiscated by the state .
of course your performance was no surprise to me . after the other day i regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled .
you 're more than kind . but it 's still miss channing 's performance . i 'm just a carbon copy you read when you ca n't find the original ...
< u > no < /u > ! ! what 's with digging the holes ?
they come on land and they 're brazen . they 're also attracted to noise , you can see i make a lot of it .
yeah , when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard . it scared the shit outta me . sure you 're okay ?
yeah , i guess . i 'm just a little fucked up .
well , mr. president ... they do n't quite know what to think .
gentlemen , needless to say , there is going to be a full congressional investigation of your respective operations . good night .
would n't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts .
might get drummed out of the pornographer 's union , and then where would i be ?
it was n't deep enough . i told you it was n't deep enough , but you would n't listen .
it does n't neccessarily matter . they do n't even know who those people are , and even if they did , they have nothing to connect them with us , nothing at all .
% on the math final ! no one could be that dumb with numbers .
well , at least you did n't lose your lunch over a bug . how embarassing .
no , i stopped . i did n't want to feel like i was being artificially modulated .
i know what you mean . that 's why i stopped .
yeah yeah i guess i do but there 's a lot more to this whole thing than i thought , charley .
you do n't mean you 're thinking of testifying against
i think wally will be fine , mrs. worthington -- he seems indestructible to me .
i do n't know . just promise me one thing .
i thought i 'd go along for the ride .
now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for , lothar ?
geoffrey , you do so love putting on a disguise .
i do so love you . what do you smell of ?
i thought he was in prison , in england .
well , either they have a very liberal work-release program , or he 's out , because he 's here in l.a. , looking for you .
well , let 's see ... i guess i 'd have to put traditional jazz , blues , and ragtime music at the top of the list , then probably ...
let 's just say `` music '' - that way you only use up one ... wait , we have to go in here for a second ...
well , you can try talking them into that , if --
i have enough flaxedil with me to put him out . and i think i know a way to --
paris . there is still much to do . we 'll be back soon . be ready .
but aramis -- ! phillippe can learn in time , but --
due to mr. gill 's untimely demise and everything , i guess you two will have to improvise the next round .
right . if i win , you wear a dress on our date .
almost seven . no -- no , he 's not seven yet i am sure --
well -- it seems to me -- i remember when you paid me --
and very true . your lives are therefore , as a rule , shorter , not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide .
that 's all very fine if it works out . a little amazing , of course .
kind of exclusive , ai n't you ? we got calls to make , you know .
run down and get some smelling salts , will you ?
dammit , radar , wait till i call you ! tell major burns ...
one of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight ?

did it occur to you they might find us ?
he ai n't as tough as you , kid .
well , i guess i woulda at least pulled my pistol an ...
i 've had it . no more wirehead shit in my car . you understand ? you want to poach your lobes , do it somewhere else .
okay , you got my attention , but this is cutting off the circulation to my head , here . d'you mind ?
its not the pin your father wore . its an exact duplicate . inside is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company .
if youve come here to look after me , mr. bond , thank you , but no thank you . i have two bodyguards , i dont need a third ...
you know ... there 's not going to be a happy ending to this . it 's not possible anymore .
if we get him , i 'll be happy enough .
i 'm sorry ? what are you oozing about ?
that episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy , but you 're determined to ruin my day .
oh , i would n't be so sure . what with all the cash , i think i could go with conspiracy to traffic .
i 'm tellin ' you , i do n't know nothin ' about that fuckin ' shit .
uh , eddie ? the , um , ballistics guy , george ... ? he called , and ... his tests show that shu 's gun fired the bullet that killed jimmy chin .

... for christmas , okay ? every magician needs a white dove , a < u > real < /u > one , they < u > do < /u > !
well , that 's a long way off , sweetie . we 'll talk to mom and dad ...
well , i wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now . once we get the baby , god willing , we can create a more decisive palette .
why do people think yellow is gender- neutral ? i do n't know one man with a yellow bedroom .
a little incestuous , but at least it 's original . who 's the guy in the halloween costume ?
he 's a vat grown ninja , the royal family 's bodyguard . watch out for him , he 's no joke .
i do n't know , but it 's the reason i 'm living here and you 're just passing through . now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars .
it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars , because i do n't have the money .

orchard way . [ realizing , in a whisper ] you 're not coming back , are you ?

nolan , me lad , ye 're dreamin ' again .
it 's like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part except for the mark .
like putting on a play ... guess some people forgot their lines .
of course , the porters will be very well paid - that is , within reason .
i 'm afraid that would n't help . you see , we have no porters here .
we got it , men ... ho-jon 's keep as androscoggin ... if there is such a place . and the big news is , the general wants a rematch .
i 'll tell you my news . i 'm retiring from football .
she 's the first woman in a long time that 's ... no . she 's the first woman ever . and she loves batman . not bruce wayne . if i let go of batman i 'll lose her .

it was the poorest lemon ranch in california , i can tell you that . my father sold it before they found oil on it .

it can be arranged . seeing as how i 've read your books . i do n't see why i should n't share my pictures with you . it would be an honor .
why did they do all this for chrissakes ? -- what were they after ?
total manipulation . i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution , but they do n't think along philosophical lines .
what , no flowery speeches ? about what a monster i am ? what a vulgar fiend ?
i 'm not interested in you . you disgust me . i 'm interested in my own nature and know i ca n't trust you to tell me the truth about me .

well , you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here . in the ocean . percent of the earth 's surface is water , norman . that 's first grade geography .
it 's a mistake , honey . you two go on . i 'll walk back to the depot .
what 're you talkin ' about ? that 's your son in there .
who else ? i 'm the one who runs the estates while you 're here risking everything we have for the glory of rome ! or for the glory of you !
i 'm a soldier -- we 're at war . i ca n't stay home tending the damned olive groves ?
i ... i do n't know what to say .
do n't hold it against him . he just never got caitlin out of his system . it 's not your fault . it 's dante . i do n't know thing one about chicks . do you want to cry or something ? i can leave .
you < u > did < /u > , you --
i was trying to pay you a compliment , i was guising it as science 'cause i know you 're comfortable in that arena . science .
you were acting for our benefit . and i apologize . i misunderstood you .
well that is to be expected . my father ...
bedrock ! i can not dig any further in zis direction !
we 're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days . dry up into crunchy little pinkies .
come on . do n't you find christie attractive ?
let 's not get lewd . i 'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation .
by bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites , i can send a long-range pulsar signal to within two feet of the rangers coordinates .
... i just pray we 're not too late .
listen . i 'm craig schwartz , just starting out at lestercorp .
how dreary - to be - somebody / how public - like a frog / to tell one 's name - the livelong june / to an admiring bog !
sergeant west 's served for twenty- three years . he 's the public face of the modern army .
and you notice i 'm not in the army anymore .
you think you 're gon na last all summer ?
i 'm not sure i 'll last all week . i 'll tell steve .
she 's an aristocrat 's daughter . she 's not one of us . in any case , it will all be over soon . you 'll kill fox , and she 'll marry .
that 's not for her . she should come to wudan and become a disciple .
how come you 're so up on dr. hudson ?
she is a writer , writing best selling books about serial killing . giving lectures she 's well-paid for . her interests are not the interests of law enforcement .
rewrites that bob barrenger requested ... the `` dead horse scene , '' the ...
whatever it is . go < u > do < /u > it . how you doing on the permit ?
scared of oswald , are you ? why , if his parents had n't eighty- sixed him you two might 've been roomies , at prep school !
`` oswald '' is linked to the red triangle gang . i ca n't prove it but we both know it 's true .
you 'd be shit out of luck if not for me . you saw what you saw because i led you to it . i 'm putting my ass on the line for you .
your ass ? i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters .
do n't be silly . what are you sorry about ?
the way you were looking at me , i just went .
i 'd rather stand if it 's all the same to you .
i do n't exactly know what to say -- i 'm sorry .
we were n't there . the handbook says funerals are n't for the dead .
god , if this is true this is like , amazing ! i kinda like it up here . can i visit you sometimes ?
it 's paradise . we could be very happy here .
but i have to go back . i brought you here so you 'd be safe . from her .
no , i 'm okay . will i really be able to dig him a grave ? the soil looks thin .
soil 's thin , all right . but you 'll manage .
-- if they want someone to blame , they can blame me . agent scully does n't deserve this .
she 's in there right now saying the same thing about you .
but i 'm not that late . you did n't have to give away my seat .
i was n't sure if you 'd make it .
frankie ... the little guy , he would n't be fuckin ' the jew 's wife , would he ? because if he is ... it 's a problem .
what could i say ? i knew if i gave the wrong answer , i mean , nicky , ginger , ace , all of 'em could 've would up gettin ' killed .
i have n't been briefed on any such thing !
apparently , this project is -- unique . but it 's heavily protected -- all formulas are heavily codified !
from princess helena and other members of your family .
my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person .
now edna says you short-changed your last meds . you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time , y'know .
just want to be a little sharper . for a few minutes .
whoa , elizabeth . a little hostile , there . maybe you should be the one in therapy . then mom and dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts ... so we wo n't have to .
maybe you 'd like to tell mom and dad why you stopped taking your medication .
but you have a vision . do n't you want to help your parents ?
i tried to tell them , but they would n't listen to me .
and if i were in the comoros , in the indian ocean , where would you be ... ?
a few more moments , still in this business . then i 'd find you .
he was going to take away all my data , equipment --
better than your life . victor 's not the one who has to get into that thing . we are .
-- you can sit up and look at me if you 'd like -- -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here .
kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker , are n't you ? how 'bout you let me explain it my own way ...
just get me out of here as soon as you can .
ok , you 're scheduled to leave saturday , but we 'll hold a seat thursday in case , but first class is full , you 're waitlisted for an upgrade ... there might be a seat on lufthansa ...
he would have done it to us , right ?
exactly . this is our little secret , partner .
well , if he has n't , i 'm vastly mistaken .
and have < u > you < /u > found peace.. ?
even if i got there first she would n't go with me .
she would if she heard my voice on the phone .
i do n't know . maybe i should grab my mace . i 'm a civil attorney . i have little experience with `` the criminal mind . ''
i 'd just like to pick up a few of my things
how do i know he did that to you ?
i came to you straight after he did it . i showed you what he 'd done and asked for your help .
to women . they 're all whores . let us not forget what chenowsky said . `` the greatest men are the most alone . '' and without suffering , jeffery , you will never gain wisdom .
i 'm not suffering , you know . i do n't give a shit .
he 's the pro from dover and i 'm the ghost of smokey joe .
save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home .
i sympathize with your problem -- and believe me , i 'm very sorry --
you 'll be a lot sorrier before we 're through with you .
heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them !
right funny , hai n't it , how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat !
so you 're saying as long as that door stays locked , we 're okay ?
hell no ! ! the house will kill ya !
got a job at old frank 's place . his son runs it now .
oh man , that kid takes himself real serious .
you might not have done it had you known .
you 're damn right ! i 'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer !
fortunately , my needs are met in that department .
so , what , you just like the sound of your own voice ?
yes , generally , to see pap . however , point number two : a brief tenure in hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays .
i do n't know , garland ; my place is here right now . i feel i 'm on the brink of success-
you men are shameful . if you 're not thinking of your weiner then you 're acting on its behalf .
then on behalf of my weiner , i 'd like to ask for an advance .
you oughta try on the problem i got in here .
i need you to let me talk to mr. smith .
thank you , annette . chance hill has been with my family for over sixty years . does your family do much riding ?
my mother and i used to ride a lot , before she got sick .
aitz chaim he , dude . as the ex used to say .
what the fuck is that supposed to mean ? what the fuck 're we gon na tell lebowski ?
they seemed to be plausible this time . a general strike is a good argument for the un .
the un is far away , dear sir . it is easier to make oneself heard with bombs . if i were in their place , i would use bombs .
four months , two and a half weeks -- that 's how long . and you 've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined .
lily , i do n't think even you could know that --
that 's what i want to talk to you about ?
i wrote a check for a thousand dollars . you guys did n't have a table that was in the kitchen ?
i 'm going to change for dinner . i 'll see you shortly .
sounds good . i 'm just going to run up to my room . hop in the shower . jump into my jogging suit , and i 'll be right there .
you gon na sit at home the rest of your life ? jesus !
well , it 's better than windin ' up like a bum .
listen to what i 'm saying . the militia 's arriving to quarantine the city . most of us are getting out while we still can .
you 'll be leaving then . just as well . you never were cut out for this , henry . goodbye .
i do n't care . i need my hat . i wo n't go without it .
what could i do ? if she insisted , i had to drive her home for her goddamn hat . i threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone .
yeah . and you used that . used < u > me < /u >
do n't put yourself down like that . i < u > never < /u > used you . i worked my way up like a marine grunt !
are we supposed to be up here ? the rules said ...
homer , you the only one who 's read them rules , so you the only one who feels like he 's doin ' somethin ' wrong .
the hell you are n't , you 're comin ' with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way . you hear me , private ?
i hear you sir , but i 'm not leaving .
i knew what he wanted , and i did n't want any part of it .
fuckin ' walking around with a big head . you better check yourself ...
you 're all one way ! i 'm bein ' reasonable with you ; give me somethin ' ... give me one of them , anyway ... just one ...
so -- you want me to send one out there ... okay . i 'll see what i can do .
no , you do n't ! he does not work well with others .
what do you mean ? what 's he do ?
for the last time boy ! ! ! what do those guns mean ? ? ! !
they mean , pig ! , that the black panther party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons . we are going to shoot you ! ! !
hold on , ramon ! is there time to make another trip ?
no , sir , it 's nearly six o'clock . okay , let 's get a move on ! when are you leaving ?
oh , do n't be silly , walter . i could n't walk around in the streets without any clothes . i 'd be arrested .
that 's what the two policemen said , sir .
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard .
he got away . i had him . he got away .
then go find a corner . i do n't want you in my way .
i think we should get something straight here . i was assigned to this office by the city .
her 'head ' ? ! you 're making this up ...
no , no ! well , see , she was having an affair with a russian diplomat who i believe was mixed up with the mafia ...
the plot thickens . it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher .
ooo , i 'm sure mrs. caldwell will love that .
listen , son , you know as well as me this kind of hitmen : they come from nowhere , get the contract and disappear . they 're lonely , worse than wolves .
may we have this wolf 's name and address ?
since we 're just starting out , i thought we could go to a bar ... sit and talk for awhile . after that , we 'll ...
actually , if it 's all the same , i 'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p . seeing how we do n't have much time for this whole transition thing .
oh , yeah . so what 're you gon na major in ?
well , state 's got a good business school . and i can probably walk onto the lacrosse team . green peppers ?
what ? is that what you 're calling me about ?
yes or no , daniel . if i get him , will you let me go after foley ?
no , you 're not . max ! max !
max is a good idea . he can help with my luggage . thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe . and thanks for the use of all the trinkets .
mm . how , uh ... how did he know that --
he 's staying at the hotel i 've gone to with , uh , with the lady in question . must 've seen us .
i do n't know . something wes had taught me . i think it means `` do n't shoot . we 're your friends . ''
they must be saudis . it 's a saudi checkpoint . oh sweet , jesus . come on . come on !
makes a lot more sense than ... well , an attack .
of course it does . if we believe that birds are attacking , why ... why next we 'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of ...
the thing is , i really like him . i finally meet a guy i really like and i 'm a fuckin ' werewolf .
we do n't know you 're a werewolf . it might never happen again . you have to get on with your life .
sometimes it 's worse to stay than it is to run .
but it takes a particularly low type of man to do it .
oh , no ... women is all we got .
you 're all one way ! i 'm bein ' reasonable with you ; give me somethin ' ... give me one of them , anyway ... just one ...
miss farmer , is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night ?
sure it 's true . i was fighting for my country as well as myself .
good for you . you 've got yourself the best guy in town .
i think so . they 're on location in arizona , shooting a western . i 'm free every evening , every week- end . if you want , we could work at your place .
i was referring to myself . i thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the wild west party tonight . invite everybody to go to the everglades -
invite everybody ! order everybody , you mean , and make them sleep in tents ! who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath , where they know where everything is ?
the nurses leo and me picked up last night . we got a date with them tonight .
you still owe me ten bucks from last week , if that 's what you 're working up to .
my brother had shouldered that burden , allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs .
there 's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life , your own career .
no wonder adrian 's rich . you use that stuff ?
sure . it works . i mean , look at this face , daniel . i 'm thirty-eight years old !
i got a letter from the judge advocate 's office on you today , fella , you 're on your way out ... they should have kicked you out on that lillibridge case . now this is it today .
i 'm an attorney on trial before the bar . representing my client . my client , do you understand ? you open your mouth and you 're losing my case for me .
what of my lips , will you soil them too ? when you 've broken every other taboo ?
i 'll fill every slippery hollow ; if you 're obliging , then you 'll swallow !
you 've been in this house for a while ?
i been here with him eight years now . he built it when he was with leora .
in case ! ! ! the gun 's in case ! ! !
in case ? ? ? ! ! ! in case of what ? in case you stumble on her , suckin ' cock in the front fucking hall ? !
i really should n't . i got ta keep an eye on my friend .
he looks like he can take care of himself .
cora peterson , his technical assistant . you 'll join duval and the others --
what can i do ? except maybe pass out ?
my self . i do n't matter . this human life , all life- insignificant . bodies -- bags of sleepy , sluggish flesh .
all right , we may be insignificant , imperfect creatures -- but we 're all we 've got .
you 're not going out to look for them ?
no , i 'm not . all i want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead . so i 'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail .
i know . what do you think i felt when you said , `` do n't be soft ? ''
jerry , i want you to be soft . you are soft -- inside - where it matters . i wanted it that day too , but did n't dare tell you .
this has gone far enough ! this interruption is humiliating , to say the least ...
well , why not say the least and get it over with ?
whats this , a signal ? will you come whenever i ring it ?
do i look like i live in a bottle ?
no he had to - he 's just - he 's out ...
he saved my life you know - has he told you ...
no . yes , i want to know what for . but i do n't want to ask .
i 'm going to kentucky . to louisville . with a friend . try to make some money . i need it , the money . i 'll be leaving early in the morning .
okay , you made your point . we 'll just have to do it next wednesday -- that 's the only night of the week i can get away .
wednesday -- wednesday -- i got somebody penciled in -- let me see what i can do -- i 'll get back to you .
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes .
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here .
i understand . i 'm just real curious like you said .
i was the same way when i was your age . i guess that 's what got me into this business .
he said he 'd consider it . it 's between you and rodriguez .
are you serious ? he 's going to consider me for he job ? what else did he say ?
so do i -- i 'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
i 'm not just giving those tickets , baxter -- i want to swap them .
you ever try to run in high heels ? you probably did .
is that an innuendo , miss teschmacher ? because if it is , you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle .
we 've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times .
but < u > answers < /u > are what we need - not more questions !
between your book sales and this tv thing , there 's going to be no living with you . and let me guess , you boiled god down to a conceit .
you know how i feel . the world is random . the only certainty i believe in is death .
in the third reich , were n't a number of high-ranking nazis of jewish origin ?
yes , and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the final solution . really , who but a jew would want to kill ilio manzetti simply because he was jewish ? who thinks about such things ?
yeah , like a church . church of the good hustler .
looks more like a morgue to me . those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on .
i have to go to my parents ' house out in jersey . would you like to come ?
jersey ? you know what the traffic 's gon na be like ?
the scale ... it 's just ... so all the civilizations you detect ; they all end up coming here ?
not all . some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams . some never make it this far .
but i understand you , mom . i always have .
well , clearly you do n't . but i 'm not the mystery you 're trying to solve right now .
and if it is n't , why do n't we call washington on your telephone ? you tell your story , we 'll tell ours .
when you make up your mind , get in touch . the golf club is probably the best place to leave a message .
man , why do you suppose walter wants to get her alone ? you suppose he could be physically attracted to her ?
no man , he ai n't the type . he do n't get enough vitamin e .
i wanted to make a few more of these . frank 's been drinking this mexican beer . it makes a good green .
how come you 're not peeing on them yourself ?
say something , theo . give me something . a doll 's legs catch fire . theo stares into sheila 's eyes .
plan c. from now on it 's gon na be plan c. both bodies throb and grind , their sandy hands sliding over each others ' sweaty skin .
man , did you see huey down on grove street ? all up on that cop , that was beautiful .
yeah , it was alright . hey , can you give me a lift ?
no , no , no , max , that 's a very convenient out . every time some group disagrees with you it 's because of anti-semitism .
do n't you see ? the rest of the country looks upon new york like we're-we 're left-wing communist , jewish , homosexual , pornographers . i think of us that way , sometimes , and i-i live here .
number one . i saw the yellow man go into frank 's building , laughing with frank . now . the only trouble is . what does this prove ?
nothing really , but it 's interesting . they know each other . they seem to like each other .
... i make two deliveries . the first one with ten thousand , like a dry run . they watch it . see how it works . then we do a second delivery , when i bring in the half mill .
naw , naw , that 's too much exposure . i ai n't goin anywhere near that money .
get used to me , inspector . i 'm not going anywhere .
then go find a corner . i do n't want you in my way .
well , ricky . i 'm very pleased with you . now you 're beginning to live like a frenchman .
that was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon . we just barely got cleaned up in time to open .
i 'm going to do it , and you 're going to catch the bouquet .
the multi-jurisdiction task force : read alphabet soup , for the continued pursuit , and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive , evelda drumgo . the man 's hazing you .
we can use some fifty caliber and a too --
i do n't know what you 're talking about -- get fucked --
she 's in no shape to give her statement tonight ...
no , she can come in tomorrow ... gon na want to know a lot of things ...
if i knew you were coming i 'd have baked a cake .
forget everything else for a second , lynn . is there anything you can give me on dudley smith ?
ro - you ca n't really believe that . nobody can murder someone with their feelings . i mean -- - that 's crazy .
is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see ... ? god , michael -- - what am i ... ?
i 've always had a weakness for folk dancing .
she might get away with that act here , but she 'd never make it in a real nightclub .
it 's already two hours ... what are we going to do ?
it takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from lisca bianca .
bud , why are you doing this ? it 's not part of you life any more .
i 'll tell you what happened ... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh .
okay , gim me a run-down on the three females .
nexus designated mary : incept november , domestic conditioning non competitive , trained for day care position .
alright , wait ... there 's a dentist in brentwood peddling morphine ...
careful she does n't hit her head on the way .
it 's the best collection i 've ever seen .
give me fifty bucks and they 're all yours .
without the body we have no physical proof . we need a confession .
from dunbar ? i hate to break this to you , but i do n't think he 's gon na be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty .
start with the bible ; it 's cheerier , and more artfully written .
that monstrous god of yours ? he strung up his very own son like a side of veal ; i shudder to think what he 'd do to me .
the tv . there 's some good things on it , sometimes .
i strongly doubt it , but i was n't really discussing media ...
it 's awright , tommy . i wisht you did n't do it , but you done what you had to do . i ca n't read no fault in you .
i 'm gon na go away tonight . i ca n't go puttin ' this on you folks .
what the hell 's the matter with you , jackson ?
sir , i ai n't feeling so chipper on account of wade .
that 's the idea , walter . it 's the only way to gain recognition . all the big art critics and art dealers would be there , it would be an event .
yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more .
so i got the state lookin ' for a ciera with a tag startin ' dlr . they do n't got no match yet .
i 'm not sure i agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework , there , lou .
you think you 're so hot just because you can get into any club . you think you 're so hot , just because you have sex with great- looking women . you think you 're so hot just because you broke the ensenada tape piracy ring ...
you got ta admit those are all pretty great reasons ...
i 've done my hair differently -- do you like that ?
when a lady falls in love she does her hair differently .
we sold , uh , over ninety thousand units and uh ... and danny says that we 're gon na get a gold record . yeah .
wow . a gold record , man , that 's great . so you 're , you 're like living the wild life now , huh ?
so you do n't want to fuck . that 's what you 're telling me ?
is that all this conversation means to you ? am i going to put out or not ?
the screen is enormous ! imagine king kong up *there* ! have you seen a lot of movies here ?
yes ... and no . when you come here , you do n't really care about the movie .
you seen mac ? his bed has n't been slept in .
what ? ! you mean ... i slept on this couch for nothing ? !
stacy , did fredrica ever mention a man named jamie gumb ? or john grant ? do you think she could 've had a friend you did n't know about ?
no way . she had a guy , i'da known , believe me . sewing was her life , she was really great at it . poor freddie .
what the fuck . my day 's already ruined . give me the keys . you can go back with jack . you still got a shitload of plowing to do .
it ai n't done , if that 's what you mean .
oh no , you violated clause five of our contract and i could collect right now , if i chose .
not now ! not now ! -- let me make up -- let me make up .
we 'll get separated over the target , but you and i will rendezvous for the run to china . i 'm on your wing .
and i 'm on yours . land of the free .
me too . okay . well , the main thing about climbing is never , never look down , never .
this is impossible . how am i going ... i ca n't make it . this is ... it 's about fifty feet .
do n't need to think fast to handle beer .
took some talking to convince your super i was a relative .
you fuck off . you fuck off and die i will hurt you for hurting her . you hurt her .
you just told me to fuck off . that was n't good . you 're dead .
that 's how dry cleaning works . now i 'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians .
do you think it 's necessary to explain < u > everything < /u > ?
if i may , sir ... what exactly are you offering ?
a good question . and a simple answer . no more hunger . no more smog . no more overpopulation . no more war .
i 've been just wondering if we 're , you know , ready .
of course we 're ready . we 've taken all the classes . the nursery . the books --
he 's so spooked he 'd turn over his momma , his daddy , his two-panny granny , and anna and the king of siam if he had anything on him .
this rabbit 'll do anything not to do time , including wearing a wire .
tonight , we 're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra ...
i was n't really dying , i was n't host to cancer or parasites ; i was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around .
what are you in for , if you do n't mind me asking ?
i do n't mind . smuggling . guilty . i come from arc . smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there .
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain 's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she 's in the state she 's in today .
now , dr. towler 's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?
nothing , just a jolt of deja-vu . i think i went out with a guy with a dignified british butler -- ca n't remember how it turned out..
i 'll bet the butler 's name was n't `` jeff . ''
... member of the group , was left behind what were , then , enemy lines .
on liz , as she walks through the h.q. , on a board we see `` days till election '' and % in favor % . a huge tv shows the president .
you 've never believed a word i told you about mr. august .
look , mary , now that i know you better , i think i can be more frank with you . i do n't believe you . i still ca n't understand the reason for such a wild tale . it 's like some of jacqueline 's stories .
i want to be a singer . i mean , i did n't . mother did for me .
what happened to the singing ? you 're not in a show , are you ?
you have a way of provoking his . i 've been watching you . you seem impatient with your studies .
to say the least . i came here to expand my mind , but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn . all we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new .
thank you mrs. franklin . jackie ? this has been very valuable for us . and i 'll have a serious talk with annabelle tonight .
it 's wednesday night . she 's at my house . i 'll talk to her .
do you want me to get it for you ?
no thank you , eddie . i 'll be alright .
that 's not the way it looked to me . looked to me like you was trying to make time with her .
make time ? is everybody in this town on drugs ?
no , no , i wanted to get away .
so i noticed . never seen a `` captain '' quite so ready to leave her ship .
i knew jimmy chin . the boy who was shot . okay ?
... and you were at the trial to ... to see that justice was done ?
no , i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures i 've been shown .
... did you ever use the alias clay bertrand ?
leave this room , i 'll go back with you , blow your cover .
[ i do n't think so . we want the same thing . see ya . ]
elementary physics ... a beam of energy can always be diverted ... ooh , my head are we there yet , mommy ?
almost ... i just have to adjust our course at the next junction . i 'd better go check the instruments ...
still , you have survived the dinosaurs before . you saved those kids .
a few of us survived . a lot more died . and we were better prepared and better armed . how many days have they been missing ?
let 's get us a photo and description . we 'll have an apb out while we stake out the restaurant .
that is a problem . there is no description of juntao . no known photograph .
oh , caught a few , lost a few .
story of my life . well , one thing you wo n't lose is that friend of yours back there , i 'll tell you that .
you 're wasting your time . i 'm already married to him .
not so far as i 'm concerned , you 're not . yes ?
but lots of our people do n't read , man . they need strong imagery to help them out .
yeah ... then should n't this be all of us together .
i believe the last time we came across one of these , was at the ballet . what were your words ... 'a fucking c.d . this case is closed . '
i 've always said the one reason i 'm the best detective in the industry is that i 'm the only one ... but hey , i never throw away a clue ...
i ca n't go back to jail . i got ta get out of here .
you 're not going back to jail . all we need to do is find the nanobot . once the meltdown is under control , then we deal with argon --
he 's dead . cap'n 's dead . christ , i was looking right at him when --
i mean , i mean , chrono shows we 're weeks out , so gravity was n't supposed to kick in for another i mean , i mean , i mean , why did i fall < u > at all < /u > ?
it 's all right here . give me the thousand and it 's yours .
i would n't trust you as far as i could throw that desk .
i just ca n't seem to focus on anything these days .
that 's why it 's good you came to visit me .
airight . enough . i 'm pulling him out of this . this is n't what i had in mind anyway .
then you should n't have begged me to hire him .
now wait a minute . are n't you being a little unreasonable ?
unreasonable ! have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs ? do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom ?
have you ever heard the saying , `` he has n't got enough sense to come in out of the rain ? ''
yep . you know , my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle . everything . until recently i wasn 't sure what he meant by that .
i 'm not crazy ... i 'm not crazy . he 's here ... we 've got to get to the radio and call for help .
i think we can classify this as an emergency situation .
connie 's gone . lit out this e'enin ' -- said he did n't know it was gon na be like this .
glad to get shet of him . never was no good an ' never will be --
let 's hope so . you 'll get some more clothes tomorrow . i 'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp . got it ?
no , i do n't `` got it '' . even the farmboys back in georgia come to the door when they 're taking you on a date .
a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else . where 's the doctor ?
i like your face . would you mind if doc took a picture ? i 'd like him to give your face to somebody else .
but that 's simply not possible . and i do n't find this funny anymore .
it never was supposed to he ! why is n't it possible ?
i 'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley .
yes , quite , but you should know that ...
steady , daniel boone ! you do n't want to miss ... it makes them think their medicine 's stronger than yours ...
ay-eh ... that 's jest what i tole joe powers ... that un 's gettin ' kinda sassy , ai n't he , ethan ?
be a sport . how bad could spring break in los angeles be ?
i guess we could go to disneyland or something .
correct me if i 'm wrong - we ! because when i 'm out on this very slippery limb for you , you have to know what 's involved .
ha ! my right hand has n't seen my left hand for thirty years !
i have to go back to the silo . will you be all right ?
i 'll be fine . he 's a different story .
first of all , we 'll have a nice dinner . try to find out where dorothy sings .
i already know . the `` slow club '' . it 's on route .
they are useless ! it was kirk i needed . and i let him slip away .
but surely , our mission has not failed -- ?
doctor ... you ca n't mean that ! not when we 've come this far . and if we give up , there 'll be no way of saving mr. benes --
dr. michaels is right . we have no choice .
do n't look at me , x , she handles all the details .
it 'll work faster if i have an account number .
it is awfully hot down here . how do you manage to stay so cool ?
weed lowers the body temperature . i read that ... in , uh ... er , science magazine .
what-are you ? a fucking moron ? it 's three o'clock in the morning , frank . who 's watching ? your wife ? maybe you can get us a gig playing little frank 's birthday party . what do you think ?
look . i did n't know when we were going to be on until yesterday . what was i supposed to do ? i had the pianos anyway .
now , anne , you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player ?
you do n't seem to understand that this one 's different . he has brains .
a year-and-a-half later , we were both in hawaii for the pro bowl . now i 've always hit a wall at months . every serious girlfriend lasts months . it 's like -- ka- boom . the curse of months .
that 's when you need to cement , and define define define .
i understand . pity to mess up a nice clean boat .
i got through to greer , his partner in the detective business . greer wo n't give out .
we face each other as god intended . sportsmanlike . no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone .
you mean , you 'll put down your rock and i 'll put down my sword , and we 'll try to kill each other like civilized people ?
take your group down to p and have a look see . leave the thinking to us , lieutenant . that 's not your job .
my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs , major , and if you 're walking me into a trap-
ricky , i 'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo . if by any chance you were to help him escape --
-- what makes you think i 'd stick my neck out for laszlo ?
`` get out ! get out before i call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend . this will be the end of everything ... ``
`` what about you ? what will your dad think about you ? ''
can you do that ? i mean , do you know anything about puppetry ?
i am the devil , lester . i think i can handle it .
sorry you 're gon na die -- cause i 'm gon na make it .
what color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral ?
you do n't look nothin ' like me , mister .
i did n't mean no offense . i guess you 're the one them cowboys cut up . ned an ' the kid , my partners , are they ... ?
a fire ! is this your idea of humor , my friend ?
i want the money back i 've thrown into this rubbish heap .
seymour ! hello ! what are you doing here ?
oh -- please - do n't let me interrupt finish your phone call .
there 's no face really , nothing to work with . big dots , that 's all you 'll get .
look at the guy ! he just saved fifty people . now he 's going to disappear . who is he ?
get out ! me too ! what are the odds ?
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you . i thought that earlier in the diner . that 's why i was looking at you . you work at borders , right ?
but if you 're mad at him too and he 's mad at you ... that must make us pals .
as you prefer , squire . as you prefer .
come on , bobby . time to go to bed .
mom -- why does mr. carpenter have to go down to the police station ?
that boy , he 's my friend . he likes the way i talk and i like the way he talks .
i knew you 'd do all right . well , i just wanted to check on you . i 'll say bye to bill and get on back .
now do n't say that -- he 's just off somewhere working .
i ca n't find him . i 've tried everything . i thought you might know .
yeah . keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking .
right . now who is the person in california ? the connection ?
that 's when i was a saxophone player . now i 'm a millionaire .
drop her a postcard . any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
well , after i worked on him -- thought i 'd let him rest . left the room for a bit . when i came back , he was gone .
well , where was he ? where did he go ?
not be so lonesome , either , knowin ' his name is there with 'im , not just ' a old fella lonesome underground .
casy , wo n't you say a few words ?
yes . i mean , i think so . yes . yes ...
well , either you are , or you are n't .
no , no ... it 's okay , mr. eddy .
i mean it , pete ... like that ! !
jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time , like a bird in a cage , he do n't want me goin ' anywhere ...
... you could get me money . i 'll get you out of here .
we dream about what 's important in our lives . and i seem to have become pretty important in yours . what was the dream about ?
about an airport ... before everything happened . it 's the same dream i always have -- the only one . i 'm a little kid in it .
michael myers has escaped from ridgemont . he 's here in haddonfield .
that 's impossible . michael myers is an invalid .
this swat guy might be a good idea . he may be able to take a little pressure off you . i worry about you .
you worried about me , too ? the chief 's worried about me . solis is worried about me . maybe you guys should start some kind of organization .
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
you do n't believe that . i mean . the guy 's an idiot , a moron , a complete fool ... but he 'd never kill anyone . i know the guy .
do n't forget , you owe rick 's a hundred cartons of american cigarettes .
i shall remember to pay it ... to myself .
`` the angel of flight ! '' you 're telling me you 're the a ... ?
`` angel ! '' i did n't say `` angel , '' that 's a little strong . listen , here 's the thing , i got ta get over there to the tv station to collect my million bucks .
we could cut a demo . look for a label .
that 's true , would n't that be great . of course , we never know when things are going to change . any one of us could be transferred to another convent , tomorrow .
what was mr. marsh 's physical condition prior to his death ?
very poor . he was suffering from severe arterial disease .
it 's a real mess down here . some- thing must a'gone wrong . no man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years .
tell doucet that . what was his rehabilitation training ?
huh ... i 'm glad they 're along with her , if you know what i mean ... how about jack ?
well , i think jack needs some time alone with you , darling ... he 's getting to that age , you know ... he really misses you ...
i am king , and this is excalibur , sword of kings from the dawn of time . who are you , and why do you block the way ?
i am sir lancelot of the lake , from across the sea . i am the best knight in the whole of christiandom , and i look for the king who is worthy of my sword 's service .
it was an accident . you 're not liable . tell him .
it was an accident . i 'm not liable .
no ! they said no cops ! they were darned clear on that , wade ! they said you call the cops and we -
well , a course they 're gon na say that ! but where 's my protection ? they got jean here ! i give these sons a bitches a million dollars , where 's my guarantee they 're gon na let her go .
of course ... that 's settled then . but just you remember your promise ...
we 'll remember . but that 's a long time off ...
the university computer is down for maintenance , but i 've been going through my own notes ...
look . there 's the order : you wrote it : desalvo , bianchi & buono , berkowitz and dahmer . it 's going to be dahmer next . which means he 'll kill a man .
all right , i hurt your feelings . but you know better than to go lightin ' fires .
that ai n't why . i just figure it 's about time to start runnin ' my own life .
hundreds of people . believe me , i did n't imagine this .
i 'm not saying you did . in science we always look for the simplest explanation .
well , i 'm going to read it anyway .
come on . crabs . do n't do this . he 's one of my students , for christ sake . i 'm not even sure if he 's --
i was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago .
your agent said she would tell her you were okay . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself .
it 's hard to understand because it says in addition to but i ca n't exactly understand in addition to what because there 's actually nothing to add it too ...
i think that 's a type-o then , that would be a mistake .
i do n't know why you should be so upset . stop that playing , max . it seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together .
look , i 'm supposed to fix up your script . there 's nothing in the deal about my staying here .
i had him hooked . he was just about to ask me out . i could tell .
that guy 's a jerk . i did you a favor .
look , this is nothing personal , but i do n't think you can do it .
thelma , i 've lost my wife , i 'm not losing my child .
why should you be ? after all , six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater-
i hope you do n't mind my speaking to you ...
i do n't like that word much , carter .
we do n't serve them here and you know it . i asked him to leave and he went crazy on us . he owes me money for this damage .
and what was the trip < u > before < /u > ... ?
that , that was < u > business < /u > ...
yeh , and what does cole say about that ?
i do n't know . he took it hard .
it would n't hurt . you ca n't go on living in fantasies . did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb ? and drop it ? why , our strategic defense boys would have --
you 're right , you 're right , superman . there were wrinkles to iron out . but , well ... ... there is this new rocket , the xk .
you told me that on the phone . what the hell are you doing here ? showing off your communication skills ? go back to your people and tell them when they 're serious to put a number on the table .
i will relay the particulars of our conversation to mr. maranzano .
then it sounds like i 'm doing you a favor .
it may sound that way , but i react out of fear . my life has nothing to do with what i like or do n't like . you have n't been listening , have you ?
are you gon na tell me about police procedure ? do me a favor , do n't give me a bunch of crap .
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible ...
if i were you , i 'd worry less about the shower and more about rick 's bachelor party .
ilene , why would i want to do that ? i trust rick .
cia policy ? the cia has no policy , mr. helms . except what i dictate to you ... i try to adjust to the world as it is today , not as you or i wanted it to be ten years ago .
is that why you and kissinger are negotiating with the chinese ?
well , i think i told you on the phone .. i went up to her room to say good-bye , and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while , while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
what kind of friend ? was he a boy friend ? an old friend ? new friend ?
you 're not having a good time are you ?
oh , i do n't know . i mean look around . is n't this a fun place ?
if they do see thee , they will murder thee .
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes , and but thou love me , let them find me here : my life were better ended by their hate , than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
after we id , we bury the body . case and casket closed .
you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place . junior 's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in .
i think we 're going to have to pass on the sewer trip , boys . let me know what you find out .
okay , but you 're missing all the fun .
who ? -- be specific . how high up ?
you 'll have to find that out , wo n't you .
good ! keep going , now . the cable will terminate in a big , gray box .
okay , i 'm following the tubing . i 'm going down a passage way . how long does this stuff go for ? could you guys talk a little bit to me ?
that 's a possibility . y'know you boston cops are perking up . that 's two sound theories in one day , neither of which deal with abnormally sized men . another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent .
yeah . some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead , or silver .
might have been able to help if it were n't for you . i 've been watched so closely , i
yes . i know . well , you can help now . i issued a statement yesterday that i 've withdrawn my objections . begging her to come home . i have n't heard from her . apparently she does n't trust me .
looks like just two . we can take 'em when the time comes .
we 're only about a quarter-mile from cave entrance number five .
he had the club out on the old trail road --
we run that twenty-odd years . give it over to otis payne in april .
you think you could make an exception just this once , boss ? she came all the way down from new york .
i do n't need the baptists on my back , but i suppose i could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee .
chardin . dame marjorie . but you may call me maude .
please ! she has got to see a doctor right away .
not when it 's like this . this animal has been ashore for , hours , and drifting for a day , at least . every little nibbler in the sea 's taken a bite .
look -- can great white sharks communicate ? send out signals , or something ? you know , take revenge , sense an enemy ... .
if i ever loved narcissus it was n't like you want .
but i get what i want , always , do n't i ?
gary 's not into fiber optics . he 's betting everything on the satellites .
you wan na survive in the software business , you cover your bets ... i got ta say , this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested .
aaa ! d'artagnan ! these passages were constructed for the king 's security , not so you could step from my father 's portrait and startle me to death !
it is for your security that i have come , your majesty -- for the security of your honor .
your father knew it too . but he was never sure how much was pretense .
how do you know what my father thought - -
space lab ? ! wait 'll i get my hands on yllo .
yllo 's dead . we ... we thought you were too .
does it have to be an old mill ? where have you been ?
i was in new hampshire . i was at the old location .
i 'm going to make you a nun 's cake . it will make your mouth water .
you are spoiling me too much . i wo n't know what to do with myself when you 've gone .
-- she 's a figment of my own imagination . i , viktor taransky , have perpetrated the greatest hoax , the greatest sleight-of-hand , sleight-of-mouth , sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history ! and still no one appreciates me , recognizes what i 've done -- even you .
you 're drunker than i thought . are you doing that again ?
ninety seven million , minus eight , corrected to mass critical .
i read that with a quantum increase of seven .
phillippe -- he 's very bright , he 's perceptive , but he is in such turmoil --
you grow fond of him . that 's good .
somebody 's taken it . i ca n't find it !
clark , you want me to come in after you ? !
but . . . how could you beat him ?
high school physics , luthor . while i was recuperating i had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun , it must have been his source of energy .
y'ever look at yoself in the mirror junior , youse uglier than a dick on a dog man .
yeah , you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you , you 'd probably kill it .
there are certain meds , certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you 've done , but i 'd have to administer them myself .
wo n't work , we 're just gon na have to chance it man . i 'm sorry .
marcee , things are changing around here . you and rod will have my total personal attention .
damn right , and you can start by taking rod 's poster and putting it where people can see it !
forgive me . it is not here . i assumed he had mind-melded with you . it is the vulcan way when the body 's end is near .
but he could n't touch me ... ! we were separated !
what kind of good memories , max ? your mother and father fighting all the time .
yeah , and always over the most ridiculous things .
i just want to look at it . remind me of what i 'm dying for .
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .
no ... apparently they ca n't tell us what happened yet . something about a matching serial number that got burned . but i had to sign a form saying i would n't talk to anyone about it .
so we 're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows ?
aaaaa ! ! ! get the fuck away from me !
what are you so damn angry about ? did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out ? huh ?
thank god , we discovered in time . we hadda forget the whole fuckin ' thing . just walked away from it .
so who 's the rat this time ? mr. blue ? mr. blonde ? joe ? it 's joe 's show , he set this whole thing up . maybe he set it up to set it up .
i love linda . myself , i love linda so much !
only , good people love linda , see . what linda has , linda --
jack 's pinned down sarah . should be a second . keep dancing .
we were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times .
i used to work here summers when i was a kid .
ethan , tell me more about this woman who 's after you .
what is ridiculous ? wolfi has many admirers in vienna . they love him here . people send us gifts all the time .
but you ca n't take her without reference . it 's unheard of !
he made me look the wrong way and i cut off my hand . he could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head !
i am looking where i should to become a bride !
come to think of it , how 'bout some money upfront ?
oh yeah sure . why do n't i buy you a plane ticket right out of here while i 'm at it . i < u > know you < /u > ... this is what you do : go to the house to see her .
eight weeks , sir . but you do n't have eight weeks so i 'll do it for ya in two .
mr. scott . have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four ?
uh ... yeah . yeah . she 's real nice .
well , what 's nice about her ? tell us !
oh no , it 's been much more than that .

pink . there was a number on it . i remember . al ? i have to follow through with this . i have no choice .
the pill was pink , i remember . it had some letters and numbers on it . what were they ? al ? al something . four digits . i do n't like taking pills when i do n't know what they are . i have no choice .
it 's what the natives are calling the lions- -two lions have been causing trouble-
-what 's the surprise in that , this is africa ?
i do n't know how i could have lost it there . i was nowhere near that niche .
oh ... that 's strange . maybe -- are you sure this is your bag ?
it gets worse there . leavin ' me to my own mind . that 's just not good .
here . pound this and i 'll join you .
we ca n't survive this , sir . they also have you instructing dean to make the payoff to hunt .
there is nothing in that statement the president ca n't explain .
she 's not my bride , she 's my fare . she 's looking for this vito cornelius . according to the phone guide he lives here .
that 's me . but i do n't know who she is ... where did you find her ?
joseph miller , your honor . macready and shilts legal services .
i 've seen your television commercials . `` if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others ... it should say , `` through the < u > negligence < /u > of others . ''
you could have married sam wainwright or anybody else in town .
i did n't want to marry anybody else in town . i want my baby to look like you .
that monstrous god of yours ? he strung up his very own son like a side of veal ; i shudder to think what he 'd do to me .
you know what sacrilege is , do n't you ? the last refuge of the failed provocateur .
yup -- sweeney , flood , farrell -- waiting for you --
fine . the first thing to do is -- present mr. smith to the press -- in the *right* way . hurry him along , bill .
great . and your all set for the performance ?
yeah , it 's a simple piece . if they get the floor done in time , me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon , but it 's not critical .
and that 's all the gratitude i get for saving your hide .
the truth , now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps ?
she was a little over-excited , that 's all . poor kid .
it was that place . that creepy cemetery up in the woods . whatever disease the kids in this town have got , i do n't want ellie to catch it .
this is li 's personal sword , a great hero 's weapon ! he is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it . it 's too fine a gift . i can not accept it .
sir te ! it has brought him as much trouble as glory . help him to leave these troubles behind . otherwise , he 'll never be able to start anew .
talk it through : childs , mueller , and nunez know they 're going out on the regular tuesday night drill , hurricane or no hurricane , so they plan it : kill west , pin it on pike .
and they 're smart about it . they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated , you need a fall guy and for that to work , you have to have a witness .
tommy leonard . the eyewitness in the corvis case .
some hooker phoned it in . there was a riot at his apartment yesterday .
i guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older ... and maler . like you .
hey , i thought i was n't your type .
no ... you 've always been crazy . this is just the first chance you 've had to really express yourself .
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty .
i 'm scared . a week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun . this afternoon you 're out there wielding it around like clyde fucking barrow , for christ 's sake ! what 's with you ?
okay , it was a cheap thrill , it was stupid , i admit it , alright ? but let 's not blow this . not now ... let 's just get the photos .
daddy , buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books . mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it , he took the lords name in vain , then claimed he had n't said it . he lied , daddy .
you must n't be a tattletale , dear . you must n't be delilah-ish and jezebel-ish toward your brother , dear .
hey , hey , are n't you afraid you 'll burn out a tonsil ?
tonsil ? me ? no ! me burn a tonsil ? `` my tonsils wo n't burn as life 's corners i . . .
i like 'em . if you do n't you can f --
hey ! when i was your age , there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood .
my darling , eugenie , dainty morsel ! get on your back ! let 's try it dorsal !
was ever a man more risquč ? he wants to take me every way !
o sweet my mother cast me not away . delay this marriage for a month , a week . or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies .
talk not to me , for ill not speak a word . do as thou wilt for i have done with thee .
we do n't know who jonas is . we do n't know who it is we 're cooperating with .
i 've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face , liza . what i saw yesterday , i know not to ask questions . we 're out . shut off . terminated . < u > understood < /u > ?
will you tell the gentleman i 'm not in ?
mary dawson , huh ? mary dawson , my eye . that dame took you for a sleigh ride that new york will laugh about for years . she 's the slickest , two- timing , double-crossing
well , forget about it . hawk and i are going to rio . we 're hurt , we 're tired , and a hero ai n't nothing but a sandwich . right , buddy ? ...
hudson , god 's given you a gift for cat burglary , you can t just ...
i 'm sure you 're quite willing to be decent about this .
decent ? why miss schuyler , i want to be noble .
i thought that 's what i did . who was it that you talked to ?
that guy graham i told you about . he said taking advice from someone you do n't know intimately was ... well , he said a lot of stuff .
so they 're walking along and smiling . that does n't mean he 's going to talk . there 's no evidence until he gives public testimony .
thanks for the legal advice , charley . that 's what we always kept you around for . now how do we keep him from giving this testimony ? is n't that the er as you put it main order of business ?
i had a big brother who died over there , too . he was n't no flyer though . he was just your basic marine corps type . i was only twelve when it happened , so i do n't remember much about him .
i sure remember tommy . mind if we talked about something else ?
this is for lawyers to talk about , this concerns a run-of-the-play contract , and this you ca n't rewrite or ad lib !
are you threatening me with legal action , mr. fabian ?
and , i 'm told there are questions as to our `` star witness ' '' veracity .
his `` veracity '' was good enough for the state of mississippi .
not yet , my friend . it 's your tomato that 's dying .
< u > what < /u > ? oh no ! better it was me . there is n't another good tomato within a hundred leagues .
you represent the united states now . we have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just .
major arnold believes he has a moral duty , too .
you ever been near a meat packing plant ? my father makes a couple million per , but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke .
got the same problem with my pop -- garlic . nothin ' you can do .
painful lymph glands ? forget fulness ... irritability ... depression ?
yes , yes , and definitely yes . also ... i get confused .
the five-fifty . we already passed it . but it 'll take him way out of his way .
pull over . i 've got to get back there .
i ca n't imagine anything dead playing that music .
well , it 's probably just the caretaker , and that 's exactly who we want to find . they 'll have a telephone . c'mon .
the missing piece of the jigsaw . i tried to get you to give it to me as peter ; i tried to steal it from you as dr. darling . as myself i 'll be a bit less subtle . with this ring my plan will be complete .
how wagnerian ... do you mean to say you 've waited all these years because you could n't create a chip on your own ? that would have amused peter .
no . not remotely . i just want to find out about him .
you want a tail . i got a guy in seattle --
right . what do you suppose today 's saints are smoking ?
there are no saints today . good people yes , but extraordinarily good people ... those i 'm afraid we are sorely lacking .
... but that 's two hundred dollars . this is blood money ...
if we do n't look like we know what we 're doing , then we may as well ...
no , you look good . i was just wondering .
last year was awful rough -- mama passing on and the whole business with o.j. -- i mean it 's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys , but it really knocked me for a loop --
letty , dinner 's almost ready . the souffle ...
i 'll be back before you can say souffle .
oh , dear -- i keep forgetting i 'm not in kansas .
come along , dorothy -- you do n't want any of those apples . hmm !
[ lot of ] how many cats you have -- what 's the matter -- rats ?
yeah -- thousands , and right in my back yard .
i know , but we ca n't quite figure out how to , y'know , do it .
so you need my help ? oh my g-d , this is like asking me for help with your homework . hey , mink , c'mere !
this morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving .
as long as it 's on their terms . if your work and your private life do n't correspond to their specifications you 're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever .
so you 're telling me , you 've got a gun to your head and you do n't think for one second , what if this , what if that , maybe i should n't do this , i shoulda done that .
i do n't do that . that 's just not for me ...
what do you know about the ear ? anything ?
did n't my father tell you not to talk about it ?
some kids found her necklace near tipper creek , as well as what might be her blood on a rock .
the problem , starla , is , the last person anyone saw her talking to was grant .
do n't be offended , major . our president holds the same views .
do n't you think he knows something about this , general ripper ?
okay ... so i 'll see you tomorrow . let 's not drag this out . we do n't enjoy another that much .
if there 's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know .
can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who did n't exist ?
it was n't her body . it was her body of work .
i 'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway . believe me , i 'd prefer not to . i may be synthetic but i 'm not stupid .
all right . let 's get on it . what 'll you need ?
not too far . are you a bird-watcher too ?
me ? nah . i 'm more of a people watcher .
does that cost extra or you throw them in ?
you 've got me all wrong . i do n't charge money for something that i myself find pleasurable ...
do n't distance us . from now on , let 's be like sisters .
then as a sister , let me wish you happiness in your marriage .
if his grace is not satisfied with me , he can dismiss me .
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg . your father is waiting for you there patiently . i will speak to you further when i come .
no books . no elephants either . no really good elephant books .
still , it 'd an odd name . i do n't remember seeing it on the club registry .
but ... do n't you think we should at least ... go and ... welcome her ?
as long as she brings food and supplies , she 'll be welcome .
i did n't mean for anyone to play anyone else 's radio either , major .
yes , sir . general , can i ask a question ?
homage is nothing . it is the crown that matters !
the crown is that of scotland . and scotland is william wallace .
`` you 're playing a dangerous game here . if you 're trying to blackmail me ... it 's not going to work . ''
`` you know what i want ... it 's not that difficult . ''
tell me about them , thea . they have great wings end long teeth --
sharp , shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
what the fuck happened to you ? will you tell me ?
what happened to me ? what happened to you ?
... i 'm a priest ! i 'm here to serve life , all you want to do is destroy it .
ah , father ... you are so wrong . let me explain ...
can you rely on how much they said you 'd get ?
it 'll be more than enough . we can get out of here ...
and what went on your little party in atlantic city . i got ears .
that little party 's gon na make you a lotta money .
it 's only a couple of courses ... just for the draft .
charlie , couple of courses is n't enough to get you student deferred ... i mean if they wanted to draft you , you would 've been drafted by now .
... i missed two-face by a heartbeat . when we catch him , you got ta let me kill him !
we do n't kill . killing is what damns you . it- . what am i talking about ? this conversation is over . you 're going away to school .
i 've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex ... the two of you got a nice patter going ... got a nice rapport ...
and you got minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening .
i admit , getting it back makes me realize how much i 'd missed it .
but it 's not your sword anymore . you gave it to sir te .
what 's the last thing you remember , data ...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl ... '
... 'ace ' rothstein , accused the state 's top gaming officials of corruption .
what are you running for , bob ? what are you running for ?
well , what are you doing ... what are you doing with-
honey , there 's a spider in your bathroom the size of a buick .
agnes , i do n't believe you know nothing about sex ...
i ca n't help it if i 'm stupid .
and why are you always wearing black ? it 's so down . it 's totally not your color . i do n't think you have a color .
what do you want ? encouragement ? 'gosh , buffy , you 're so special , i just want to give you a great big hug , oh i 'm just having a warm fuzzy . '
well , now you know ... the enemy is on the move . we have n't much time .
well , i 've brought you here . what now ?
you must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey . he could never get through that country alive .
i ca n't let him go alone . it 's suicide !
she wants me to talk to you , heather .
who < u > is < /u > this ? ?
and you did n't send her to a doctor .
i did n't guess until it was too late .
when the mayflowers find out we have the codex , they 're going to want to make a deal ...
and then we 'll arrest those greedy pigs ... is that it ?
i want to go home . i do n't like it here .
oh , jesus , come on , will you ? do n't mess this up anymore than it 's already been messed up . join the other kids . do that and before you know it you 'll be as happy as a goddamned clam .
we miss you at the bureau . abe 's crazier every day . and father 's still mad at me -- come back , liz . come back . i --
no . not this time , h.b . it 's been months since i 've had an episode . and you know what ? i 'm learning to control it .
coulda happened to anyone , man . i never knew her to be reckless . i mean , sure , she would smoke a little grass , or something , have a few drinks . but that 's it , nothing more than that .
no , not my girl . self-control , she had . point of pride . and people do n't change , do they .
i did n't say that . i never said --
me ? i say you do n't have enough brains to be stupid .
where are you going ? to him ? is that it ? to be a whore to that gutter rat ?
i 'd rather be his whore than your wife .
what effect do you think this would have on an infant ?
well ... the thing is , nobody remembers their infancy . and anyone who says they do is lying . we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life .
will you please be quiet ! we must have order here . this has to be some sort of mistake .
mistake ? we 're all alone here . they waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this . reliant is supposed to be at our disposal , not vice-versa .
are n't you glad you did n't move up here and marry her ?
do n't need a lecture . you fucking told maya , did n't you ?
course there 's a war . i 'm watching it on television .
n'who might < u > you < /u > be , when all 's said and done ?
i can tell from the tone of your voice , dave , that you 're upset . why do n't you take a stress pill and get some rest .
hal , i 'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual hibernation control .
no , no , see , you , you do n't understand .
hay ? yeah ? so teach me a lesson .
colonel , sir , mrs. washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner ?
tell mrs. washington i am compelled to stay a while longer .
i got it figured out ... he 's got this thing with bathrooms . if he makes it through customs , he 'll be heading for the john .
good . good . do not let vig out of your sight .
you should . you can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that . very informative . stay and watch it with me .
you know , i 'm kind of tired . i 'm just gon na go home if it 's all the same to you .
it 's all right , jabez . we 'll find something to pay stevens .
if the pig had n't broke his leg , we could have taken him .
i would n't do that . the doctor seems to think he 's suffering from some rare disorder .
it 's not so rare . he grew up on our street . he 's had a rough life and he 's a little crazy from it , but that 's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water .
i know , i know , stupid . i mean where you goin ' ?
it 's an open ticket . i can go anywhere up to $ .
she 's off limits for bums like you . leave her alone .
i can look at her , ca n't i ? it 's a free country .
people have been asking me about that story in the paper . i told them you were the first person on the scene . they were asking me for all the details .
it was pretty gory ma , let me tell you . but you have to turn all that off , and do your job , just like pop used to say .
you think i 'm some sort of sap ? ! do n't you ? !
no . i admire you . i ... i fell in love with you the first time i saw you . i did . i think that you are the most --
michael , you 're sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family .
your family still carries the name corleone , and you will run it like a corleone !
and did you put the envelope in your pocket ?
yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
how long have you and hambone been hangin ' out ?
you 're the one that put us together . we 're friends .
oh , i 've got stories , believe me . they 're a little more risque than tales of band camp .
are they gross or something , like guy stuff ? tell me .
right , of course , the company ... but you see , i 've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
uh , victor , i hope i have n't done something to make you think ...
and you live in this building all by yourself ?
yeah , i live here pretty much alone right now ...
i mean really ! that business with your tongue . what is that ? that 's disgusting !
and , oh my god , that other thing , that pointing to your lap ? what 's that supposed to mean exactly ? does that mean pull over , i want to show you what a big fat slob i am or ...
so , you were bored ? is that how this blessed miracle came to be ?
nah , it was a premeditated act . the sex , i mean , not getting pregnant .
had a great swing with his blade . for a pope .
good times then . a man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears . not like now .
it 's far too dangerous . zordon would never allow it .
if we do n't try , zordon wo n't survive !
i brought you up here , dr. bright , because i want you to understand that we are on the path . the only difference is that you are walking with your head down , afraid to look up , to see where the path is going .
i suppose you are going to tell me where it is going .
course , if carl lost both batteries , dead in the water , his radio would n't work . so how would he signal for help ?
compressed air horn , most likely . hope to god some man hears you in that fog .
you 've no right to assault me in this fashion ; i 'll call for my footman . i 'll have you removed --
am i a cursed woman , doctor ? must i be betrayed by every man i meet --
fine by me . we brought you a nice little boat , so you can all get back to shore , safe and sound .
agreed . you have the momentary advantage , sir . but i will see you smile from the yard arm , sir .
what was it . what was it , honey ?
... something about my < u > father < /u > ... ?
yes , although , i really ... .. thank you . yes , it 's great to have him with us . the whole family 's very excited .
glad to hear it . tell poor mr larson to come through , will you ?
thank you . what do you do , barry ?
i have my own business ... .i work . i work hard at doing my business .
it 's seeing-eye dogs , ma'am . if i let the cat stay , will you go out with me ?
what if i say i 'll go out with you , so you can have all these great daydreams , but then never actually talk to you again ?
the head 's okay , but i could sink a six-pack .
forget that . i want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours . i 've got some toxin build-up tests still to run .
wherever we are , it 's better than what we left . backs together --
we 'll tell them what 's happened . they 'll listen to reason , wo n't they -- ?
naw . they got some blue dye , though . you think them boots you got on come from a black cow ?
wan na get on somebody 'bout live music , get on ol ' laz , there . he the one got this place shakin ' back in the day .
no , you know what ? it 's not you , man . it 's not anybody . it 's me . whoo ! hey .
look , man , it ... shit . why do n't we get something to eat ? i mean food ?
-- you 're like a little squirrel of music , storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music , musical lint , old shit , shit , shit --
-- barry , if i were to say to you i have n't seen evil dead ii yet , what would that mean ?
in heaven there would n't be dust on the wallpaper .
hon ... i did n't want to die , but really , this is fine with me . as long as i never have to wash dishes again .
listen to miss smarty mouth . out there in the free world .
what 's free about it ? i 'm looking for work .
i ca n't have you do that , nor can i have you hanging around the lobby all day .
i understand . thanks for letting me crash here .
it 's ok. do n't worry about it . accidents happen .
what a wonderful philosophy . thanks for being such a sweetheart . you could have been a real dick .
nothing 's going on . maybe he does n't want to be alone . he 's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
... i do n't know , daddy seems funny to me . ever since joe showed . it 's like he dropped from the clouds ...
ah , alex boy , awake at last , yes ? i met your mother on the way to work , yes ? she gave me the key . she said something about a pain somewhere ... hence not at school , yes ?
a rather intolerable pain in the head , brother , sir . i think it should be clear by this afterlunch .
thanks for backing me up here , uncle claude .
do n't uncle claude me . you get a load of those crackers ? could n't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em . why you want to pick a fight with people like that for ?
it 's the law that 's buying . that 's what 's so beautiful about it . i mean , when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail ?
suit yourself . but do n't keep the boxes around here long .
i took the other road . i 'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation . i love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone . and you ?
oh , you know me , martin . i 'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer , exploiting the oppressed i got shot for at kent state . but why do n't we have a drink and forget the whole thing ?
i do n't know what you 're raving about , young man . and , furthermore , i 'm not interested .
wellof all thewell maybe you 'll be interested to know your bag 's gone .
cheerios and wieners . i made it myself . it 's good .
well give me some then ... i 'm starving .
general greene is here . there are two other divisions here .
colonel hamilton . anyone who served under arnold , i want them shipped north . i do n't want any troops here who served under arnold .
this thing works . we could go home right now .
i 'm not ready yet . i got ta do this for a little while .
cool your jets a second . here 's some money .
no . you took care of rent , that 's enough .
there 's only one thing you 're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher . here . it 's an authorization to employ a contractor .
i do n't know if i can do that without a ...
murders and rapes in the cities . people bomb planes ... can the police stop them ? < u > no < /u > . but feed one little cow to a crocodile ...
you 're to wait right here until the police show , you 're under full house arrest .
the baron hides in the dark in a passage under the castle ... quick , give me the dwarf 's key ... the one which opens any lock ...
in the dark , lad ? why should he do that ?
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy . eve harrington .
but , since the fire , a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation . the french have become an army of criminals , against whom russia must be avenged , against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death .
you know , general kutusov , there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by napoleon 's troops but was organized under the orders of rostopchin 's secret police .
it does n't bother me . i 'm just not interested .
oh . like i 'm not an interesting person .
frankly sir , you look a little like my father . probably explains the curious feeling of love i have for you .
for a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin ...
yeah , well ... what i was gon na tell you --
-- skip . knowing what you do about me --
is that your `` expert opinion ? '' the only answer we 've had out of you is `` i do n't know . ''
justin just tried to kill himself . the man is clearly insane .
give me their uniforms . i will put people at the gate , in disguise .
i wish i could , paul . try to hold out .
how 's about you give me those same directions .
yeah , yeah , sure . you do n't have to get all true grit all over my ass ... i 'll give 'm to ya ... you can knock yourself silly for all i care .
harry york . i work for martoni kaminski , he 's running for congress here .
oh yeah ! i saw you in the newsreel !
indeed you have , ambassador . have you sent for a doctor ?
yes , i have , and i hope you will forgive me , duroc , but unless your visit is extremely urgent , i shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow .
jane , jane , jane , jane , jane ...
it made me ill. you could get fired for things like that .
both you , idiots shut up , i ca n't understand shit ! now , what 's happened , what 's going on , and what are you talking about ?
okee-dokee . it 's like this , krinkle ; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding , they walk up to window and the guy 's covered in coke . so they bring his ass in and me an ' nicholson go to work on him .
live ? in less than a week you 're prancing about the country like a squirrel .
so why the crazy talk ? it 's a miracle it is . saint andrew has smiled on me . on us .
it 's hard to describe . i get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and ...
that 's just part of being a woman . diet and exercise should help . avoid salt , sugar , starches , caffeine , alcohol ...
we thought it would be good to break old habits , sir .
what is wrong with old habits , mr. overstreet ?
hey , i 'm not just along for the ride , so i do n't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut .
take a deep breath . you sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something .
petra , this ai n't about the people that sent us here , you know that .
no , now it 's about us . let 's do something for us before we both get killed . do n't you want to get to bora bora , xander ?
lloyd , where 've you been ? i 've been waiting forever . i 'm so embarrassed .
sorry . why are you dressed like a queen ! ?
one i think you will like ... as a , how shall i put it , as a symbol of our new understanding . an understanding between two friends .
thank you , fred . thank you . minister turns and signals . door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in . aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a hi-fi on a trolley .
my point is that you 're a clerk , paid to do a job . you ca n't just do anything you want while you 're working .
`` space alien revealed as head of time warner ; reports stock increase . '' they print any kind of shit in these papers .
i 'm leaving very early tomorrow , before you wake up .
i know . how long will you be gone ?
i do n't intend to fire her , darlin ' .
it is n't her fault if she 's popular ... what ?
the best business decision if you ever made i 'll bet .
enjoyable too . the merger never even felt work for one second .
you did . yesterday you said , and i quote , `` i have a date with roger from op/ed tonight and i 'm going to do it with him . ''
well , that does n't mean it was going to happen for sure .
cue the crowd . go to the woman 's group . get the bald guy , he 's great ...
i , unlike senator kennedy , have a plan to end the war . but not for peace at any price , but peace with honor !
it ai n't my fault you do n't know how to handle your dogs .
how my suppose to handle a dog someone jus ' let loose ?
i got two kids ... and i 'd like to see them again .
ah , i know ! you 're being very cooperative . i got no complaint against you whatever ; you got bank insurance ?
well , he never done this before , but seein ' as it 's special circumstances and all , he says i can knock one hunnert off that trucoat .
one hundred ! you lied to me , mr. lundegaard . you 're a bald-faced liar !
is newsday a real interview , or just some cute guy you 're setting me up w ...
... i do n't send you men , anymore . you do n't know what to do with them .
yeah . to go to school and , you know , paint , performances , paint .
you have to go . you always did such , uh , you know , great work . i still have some of those drawings that you 'd do in study hall .
talk about him , starling . tell me what you see .
he 's a white male ... serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group . and he 's not a drifter - he 's got his own house , somewhere . not an apartment .
listen , hannah . you do n't remember where that aunt worked , do you ? james ' aunt .
he shot the chancellor 's dog , did n't he ? the blind one .
well , you got ta call your wife then , you know , 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway , right ?
no . no , you see , i do n't have to call my wife .
dr. woodly says he 's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football . he says that when there 's a war , everybody goes but football players .
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that ?
no way , get out . i 'm gon na tell frank . i 'm gon na tell him what you said .
okay , i 'm goin ' . you 'll see , i 'll get you .
but i had this feeling i ought to make the effort . to test myself . and i flunked .
what did you have to test , for god 's sake ... the dental don juan of detroit ?
one idea that if you had fucking listened to , you would each be worth approximately million dollars .
you ca n't keep bringing up starbucks . that was your only real hit in like tries .
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate i persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate i have decided to stay-
you think you matter ? -beaumont is on that train- he matters-
you just do n't fucking get it , do you ?
you know he fucks all his girls , do n't you ?
tapert . so , now i 've got tapert , butterfield .
tapert 's got nothing to do with this . he came here to get his palm read .
mr. helms , we 've lived with communism in cuba for ten years ...
... but it has never been the policy of this government to accept that . and it is certainly not cia policy .
how the hell am i gon na do that ?
listen to me , very carefully , take your wallet out , just touch it on the corners .
they are the survivors of the steveston county massacre .
fantastic . these kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken hell house .
it 's ok. you do n't have to say anything .
but i do . i love you , too .
you did good , kay-em . i 'm proud of you .
a real mamma 's boy that one . dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum . little good it did him .
then why ca n't you -- fuck , never mind , just call donny then , and ask him to --
dude , i 'm not supposed to make calls --
but i did n't ask you to go rob a bank .
all right . i know you did n't ask me . you did n't ask me but i did it .
i do n't even know how much money that is .
it 's enough -- for whatever you need , for whatever your girls need , for whatever your girls ' girls need -- it 'll be enough .
i shall dance for you tonight as i 've never danced before .
this is a fine thing to be doing at my age .
it had the virtue of never having been tried .
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality .
regardless of how i may feel about ruby ... our fates lie along different paths . nothing can change that .
you want some advice ? do n't do this again . you know exactly what i mean .
i 'm gon na be an acrobat when i grow up .
big deal , i can do that too . thomas j , you got something !
is he the one who spread all this blood and misery ?
no , but ... why did n't he stop it ? or did he get pleasure , watching us killing each other in his name ?
excuse me for a minute . ray , i 'm right in the middle of something here . can you come back in about an hour ?
peter , at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue , ten people witnessed a free-roaming , vaporous , full-torso apparition . it blew books from shelves at twenty feet away . scared the socks off some poor librarian .
well i 'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when i 'm about to make the most important score of my life . this has got ta be some `` put-on , '' right ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm so sorry to do this to you .
she like it rough ? you like beatin ' on her ?
that ai n't my scene . if that 's somethin ' you into ...
they 're ready and waiting . you 'll soon be with old friends .
i 'm with an old friend now , dmitri .
i 'd like to spend a night with you in a bed .
we can do that when we 're very , very old .
i ca n't believe he put the moves on me . after everything i 've done for him .
he 's scum ! as far as he 's concerned you 're just a pair of breasts that talk .
actually of course i wo n't operate , i do n't do major surgery . dr. hardy will operate and of course he 'll be guided by your wishes in this respect .
let him be guided not by my wishes and not by rose 's wishes , although i am sure they are identical . let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself , because that is what has spoken through me tonight .
you have n't heard from him , have you , dad ?
why , no . . . do n't be silly .
truck stop up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .
i 'll be back in a couple of hours . and be careful with her , will you ?
you do n't need the diary , dad . marcus has the map .
there is more in the diary than just the map .
julie , wow . i was afraid you left . i was afraid i 'd never see you again .
i 'm not going anywhere , ted . you 're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
oh no , my dear . you look absolutely amazing . there 's no way i can compete with you . the scene is yours .
in the sequel , james , two lady scientists should make a monster . and our monster would be gary cooper .
look at my face . i 'm a member . i just need to know if you 've seen tyler durden .
i 'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you , nor would i , even if i had said information you want , at this juncture be able .
this is my first time at the white house . is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it ?
i did n't have the guts to ask when i first came up . i 'll get you a great tour .
i should have killed him when i had the chance ?
when was that ? in the swamp at the expense of your men ? or when he killed thomas at the expense of your family ?
i do n't trust him anymore . but they 'd never okay anything , you know ?
yeah , but they keep askin ' about it .
the boy worries me . it 's silly , but it 's like there was something still between him and his dad .
what he needs is a dose o ' salts !
you could buy yourself some things . clothes , or a nice car ...
i do n't look any good in clothes and i do n't know how to drive . what else ya got to sell , eirie ?
you do n't have to explain . you have every right to come .
i can see why you put your faith in him . he 's a genuine ... good guy ... good at what he does . that 's rare .
i see . slipping away for a little hanky-panky .
not really . i 've just always been fascinated by mars .
hemmingway . killed himself . i was more upset about that than about groppi , that 's for sure .
you know , this boy over here , once , long time ago , tried to enrich my mind ... so he gives me a book by this hemin fella ... to read , so i read it .
yeah , look at my digs ... times are tough .
oh , things are n't so bad . gee , i hope you 're not goin ' to get in any trouble .
take a vacation . i 'll pay you four hundred a day , plus expenses .
you want me to come out there and play private eye ?
apes do n't shave , you son of a bitch !
do n't quibble . you know what i mean .
it 's what you said , mom . mr. brinkmeyer 's feed is no good .
no , cathy . he sold mr. fawcett a different brand . you do n't think they 're getting sick , do you , mitch ?
no , no , no , what ... you can once , you can live without it once . come on .
oh , no , alvy , please . alvy , please . m'mrnm .
because i 'm a virgin and i do n't want no baby .
you think i want a baby ? when you 're with me , you do n't have to worry about that kinda stuff .
then this will be five . i suppose you think i 'm too drunk to count .
no . you 're just crazy about `` liebestraum . ''
are n't you going to drink your cocoa ? it 's the good kind .
mmmm ! tasty . you 're a master chef ben . just like your dad .
i remember you were in trouble all the time .
now you got me ! it 's a wonder i was n't punchy by the time i was twelve . the rulers those sisters used to whack me with ! they thought they could beat an education into mei foxed 'em .
jesus , this is major . why did n't you tell me sooner ? why 'd you hold out on me ?
your people do n't know about this part of out past . and they ca n't know -- it would threaten our entire existence here .
do n't forget our mission , shinzon . we should act . now . time is running out .
my time . i 'll spend it how i choose .
i have to go back to new york tomorrow . think of your price .
you son of a bitch , you think you can brush me off like that ? i made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders .
and you 've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game . right ? does that mean ... ?
not without lots of praying and kissing the dice . it 's a different ritual but it works the same .
my japanese is n't that hot ... besides , you 'll never get in .
it 's my last shot . i have to be on a plane home tomorrow night .
i do n't get you . even if it was true , which it is n't , what the fuck difference would it make to you ?
because if a supervisor knew i 'd seen you and i had n't reported it , i 'd lose my job as well . and i ca n't afford that .
susie , watch the language , would you please .
my instinct is that ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating , and we 'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks . if we call him now , he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we 've ever had .
so do it a favor and put it out of its misery !
no ! get in the car before they hear us !
well , my horses are feeding , as you may observe , mr coghill . it 'll take a little while .
well , fed or hungry , pulleine wants them in position immediately . .
screw you , wood ! i even sunk more money into different titles : `` transvestite '' `` he or she ? '' `` i led two lives '' ... it does n't matter ! nobody wants to see the piece of shit .
you ca n't talk that way about my movie .
no , it was so right it scares me .
i 've been thinking ... i do n't want you to be my doctor . because i do n't want you to examine me .
and it 's deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine . i guess i 'm not the girl i thought i was .
there 's nothing wrong with you , lisa . you have the town in the palm of your hand .
um , i-i did n't really want to , you know , go to a sperm bank or something , have some anonymous donor . i-i just , you know , i-i-i would n't want that .
right . we felt that if we were gon na do it , that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and ...
they told me you 're taking lithium , mom .
yes , they give me headaches . i have a headache .
i been working on some stuff for you . what'cha doing ?
i 'm going shopping . do n't try to stop me .
you 're such a beautiful man . look at you - stuck in this place , and only thinking of her .
listen to me ! is there any way i can < u > warn < /u > her what monkeybone is up to ? ?
you have n't said a word today about that garage . or what i found there .
what should i say ? you did fine work . we 'll wait on the lab .
i just think actors talk too much . does the world really want to hear your life story just because you 've got a movie opening friday ?
of course , the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more .
no . i think i said something eloquent like , `` so , uh -- maybe we should , ya know . what do you think ? ''
now that 's romantic . a proposal like that and you did n't find eternal bliss ? what went wrong ?
oh , laz ... he hurt me . he ... hurt me so many times .
no one 's gon na hurt you no more .
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy . we have compassion for all people .
these are not human beings . they are worse than ghosts .
and now every mother with money in mexico city wants bigger and better bodyguards . my own wife included .
if she pisses you off , you get another one .
what makes you know so much ? how do you know what eddie was thinking ?
i know . been there myself . we 've all been there , have n't we , miss packard ?
hubert 's ? oh really ? it moved uptown , right ?
yeah , well , oh boy , listen , i 've got to go . thank you , uh ... victoria ?
the order comes from starfleet command , dr. marcus , direct from the general staff .
but genesis is a civilian project , under my control --
sir , i took the liberty of running a gci scenario on a tm-1 earlier today ...
gci . tm-1 . what language are you talking ?
come on ... maybe we can ... where do you want to go ?
venice ... like katherine hepburn in summertime . . ... .why ca n't i be katherine hepburn ...
my sister -- she 'll want to know what happened to me .
wait a minute -- let 's talk this over first . just what are you going to tell her ?
just for the record , i understood the last part of what you said , but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever .
i was just explaining to lex here what you and i already know . just had to make it a little more complicated so he 'd understand .
i 'm sorry . i 'm pike . this is benny .
pike is n't a name . it 's a fish .
i said , 'next time , phone ahead . '
jesus christ . mr. gordon , when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons , i do n't call ahead for an appointment .
we 're on foot . we ca n't get away .
we 're surrounded by houses , dumbass . every house has a car in the garage . all we have to do is take one .
if i may , your majesty , i would like to offer a dissenting opinion .
general kutusov , feel free to say whatever you like .
i do n't want that . i want to be with you .
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment .
gallatin ! so the righteous starfleet captain finally released you . did you encounter any problems on the surface ?
no , sir . but it was n't easy ... being among them ...
you 're not . we 're level . look at the instruments , we 're okay !
they must be broken . i 'm hanging in my straps ! we 're inverted !
wait , toddy . that 's not hospitable . i want to discuss business .
you are not to set foot in here again , gray , for business or any other reason . and you 're going out now !
no ... i said `` surrender in the name of the king of france '' ...
that is not what is written in the evidence ... look for yourself !
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow .
what 's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing . yet , she says on her message for you to call her at home and she does n't leave a number . that would imply you already knew the number .
oh , i ca n't . i do n't know .
come on . where do you want to go ? anywhere you want . just say it . i can get us in anywhere .
you motherfuckin ' tino . you fucked us so bad .
i fucked up . you ca n't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything . all you 've done is put a death sentence on meeka .
as in , your ass is dead in the water .
but miami pd was n't part of the j.i.t . and from what alonzo said , he did n't give you up .
suits me ! i 'm votin ' for yours truly !
well i 'm votin ' for yours truly too !
... how do we explain that ? with the world watching .
< u > fuck < /u > the world . try a ten a.m. < u > pitch < /u > meeting , no sleep , coked-to-the-gills , and you have n't even read the < u > material < /u > .
that 's why i 'll be there at 8:45 .
i tell you what , maybe i better come with you .
it is n't her fault if she 's popular ... what ?
i said i do n't intend to fire her . i just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth , that 's all .
i 'm sorry ; of course , you know that .
two-thirty . that gives me time to see my boy .
no , no , no ... you do n't know shit about procedure ! you do n't send your best ...
i 've got the working gun , elden , me ! you wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there .
no , it was n't a bat ! i saw this horrible man - i remember him , i think ...
no , no child ... shush ... it 's all right ...
i know . it 'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila . you do n't seem like the type .
hey man . . . you don ' t think i can be `` cool '' ? you do n't think i can be `` laid back '' like everyone else ?
no i did not . i did not kill freddie miles and then kill dickie greenleaf . is he accusing me ? ask him if he 's accusing me !
he 's already angry , i do n't think --
i got a card from your uncle phil in los angeles today , said he went body surfing .
i do n't know if i can picture uncle phil body surfing .
i was told that the family wanted examination of the head .
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death , was it not ?
right between the eyes ! down and out ! the guy was gone ! i ... i could n't believe it !
you could n't believe it ? vince the prince ?
such a sad face ... you know , sometimes being different is n't a bad thing .
trust me , this ai n't one of those times .
they will escort you to your rooms now . you will be provided with fresh clothes . tonight you will be dining with his highness .
dinner ? and with a prince ? ! my luck is changing . but look at me -- my god , i 've to get ready !
well , of course not . it 's just that ... you could have warned us .
i thought i 'd be spontaneous . i mean , that 's the point of this whole thing , is n't it ?
it still does n't make sense , but it is n't worth any quarter of a million either . have we forgotten anything ?
the tooth powder . wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it ?
walk away ? andy , you ca n't be serious . how can i walk away ? do n't you see what 's goin ' on here ? do n't you see what 's at stake ?
the old man said , 'maybe your friend should give in . ' and when the old man says 'maybe ' , that 's like a papal bull . not only should you quit , you should run !
you tit . i soiled my armour i was so scared !
that rabbit 's got a vicious streak . it 's a killer !
we 're all on edge , smith . we 're a long way out ...
that 's not it . that ship was built to go faster than light ... that 's just wrong , it goes against everything we know ...
no , jack , i never got married . you ?
not exactly ... can we just take a minute here ? maybe get a cup of coffee or something ... ?
there are metaphasic particles all over the briar patch . why must this planet be ...
the concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work . do n't ask me to explain it . i only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction . after it 's over , the planet will be unlivable for generations .
that girl 's making an awful spectacle of herself .
what do you expect me to do about it ?
so not only am i a troublesome bitch , but i 'm fat too ?
come on . they make you feel nice and peppy .
do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists ?
on yes . our morale is much higher than theirs , we 're fielding all their strokes , running a lot of them out , and pretty consistently knocking them for six . i 'd say they 're nearly out of the game .
well ... come what may ... merry christmas , mr. wayne .
right . sure . and `` peace on earth , good will toward men . ''
i respect myself . a man cuss because he has n't got the words to say what 's on his mind .
tell you this : you ai n't no fool .
a long time ago . you 've repaid them many times over . ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture .
is that what this is about ? material wealth ?
how would you like to take a little vacation ? i mean you 've earned it , you know ? you deserve it .
there is some good in you , lex , after all .
and these 'sensor-swarms ' collect that data , carry it here .
new crystals : they must contain the most recent data obtained --
try and sleep , kringelein , do n't be afraid .
i 'd like to live a little longer but -- i 'm not afraid to die -- i 'm not ...
you 're a con man , and you blew it like a pimp . i did n't teach ya to be no pimp .
what 's eatin ' you ? i 've blown money before .
oh i doubt it ... lectures are notoriously boring .
no they 're not . i wan na be a writer , i wan na be just like you .
huh ? oh , geez , mr. hudsucker , i apologize , there was an awful lot of excitement and i guess i must 've mislaid --
it 's sittin ' in your apron pocket , right where you left it . imbecile .
as which point she drops to her knees in pain ...
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains ...
look , sam , do n't take it the wrong way when i tell you we wo n't be doing this again .
you do n't have to explain yourself to me , deirdre .
baby , do n't lie . i know you went out .
not me . nope . you must 've been dreaming .
you will never touch her . you will never get near her .
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva ?
i 've given it alot of thought , major . do n't think i have n't .
no , sir . i mean i did n't think you had n't given it a lot of thought .
so , kid -- how they hanging ? or do n't you say that to a little kid ?
he 's a man . tell him you 're a man .
yeah , for the last time , i hope . i 'm done with this freak show . i 'm moving back to the real world .
is that what you call it ? `` < i > real < /i > '' ?
constanzia . we expected you last week ; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week .
i know , it was chaos ; but anyway , here i am one week late . this is for my mama . you remember merle ?
you tell me ... i want to know who 's behind this . who did this to me ... how , why ... ?
how deluded can you be ? there 's no < u > why < /u > ...
seems to me you 're doing excellently without any assistance .
that 's pretty good . . . well , shut my big nasty mouth !
no , that 's ignorant . they just do n't know any better .
that 's what i thought . you better give me another example .
did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger ?
no . he said that his father 's unconscious ; he did n't say he was dying .
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you , and you did n't get scared --
of < u > course < /u > we were n't scared . just a little startled . one of those sushi dropped down my kamali .
no . i think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss ' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser .
my gosh , and for a while there , i was attracted to you .
tell me you did n't start up on that flight shit again . did you ?
of course not . that would be irresponsible and unprofessional .
then i 'll bet she 's real proud of you , huh ?
yeah . i just wish i 'd told her how proud i was of her .
so you 're telling me this is the 24th-century , and i 'm dead ?
not exactly . as i said , this is some kind of-
i did n't come this far to bury a guy that 's not my dad . he owes me .
back to plan a. the vicious cycle all over again . theo lets go of sheila .
look , you dont tell me about some godforsaken place where stuff so bad even i couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep ! what happened ? whos the guy ? the austrian ?
whos the guy ? whos the guy ! nom de dieu ! had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate id have had to kill him .
well mom , i 'll tell ya , when two of your friends die the same day , you let me know what it does to your appetite .
you 're just tired . do n't think i have n't noticed your not sleeping . that has to stop , honey .
you , sir ! you call yourself a loyal subject ?
... no ... do not call myself much of a subject at all .
why the hell are we wasting time here ? !
insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us .
i 've never heard you express any desire to leave before now . why now ?
well , i think we 're reaching the point of diminishing returns here , right ? certainly it 's learning more about us than we 'll ever learn about it .
it must be tough , having to be clark kent .
oh no . i really like it sometimes . and if it were n't for him , i would n't have met you .
you certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood . you 've killed an icon , for god 's sake .
i did n't kill anyone , bernard , there was no one to kill !
lula ... i learned somethin ' interestin ' today on a science show i heard on the radio ... how leeches is comin ' back into style .
say what ? honestly , sugar , you can talk more shit sometimes ?
oh , denby -- have you seen sally around ?
no -- i 'm looking for miss marsh myself . i thought you might know where she is --
you do n't have a boyfriend or anyone ... you know ... like that ?
actually , i was married . for four years . but ... well , we did n't fit together . i 'm divorced now .
i 'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now . you must n't scream . so tense , so tense .
you should n't have talked to norbert that way .
oh , thankyou , your honour . the tramp takes a second look at alex .
jamey mack ! be the hokey fly ! holy mother of god ! all the holy angels and blessed saints in heaven preserve us . alex breaks away but the tramp toddles alongside him .
he eats all right -- his throat ai n't scarred .
then why do n't he holler like he usta ?
the key ! ? she has the lost key ! ?
yes . no one has ever had so much , been so close . we must stop her , or it will be the end of us all .
i ca n't imagine how you ever let a man like that go . i owe viktor everything .
i think he owes more to you . but that 's not important now . i know what 's going on between you two .
you made him strike out . you wished it on him . you want to lose . it 's too hard for you to believe in something . it 's hard to have faith . it 's hard nwork to trust somebody .
`` it looked extremely rocky for the boston nine that day . ''
burbage offers me a partnership in the chamberlain 's men . for fifty pounds my hired player days are over .

i like your heart and i like your style . you might just do , little . lessen you got to git back to that train job .
i done told the man what he could do with his train .
hey lloyd . this looks like another one of your mix tapes .

i mean drugs . i thought you said he was ?
he would n't use around me . i do n't like any of it .
i know they made me . even got the label on my neck to prove it .
the technical term for you is `` chimera '' ...
thank you . if i had that kind of support on a daily basis , i could definitely shape up by the turn of the century .
so why do n't you give me a jingle in the year ?
it 's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about .
they do n't care about all the things we do right . [ beat ] but they might ... they might care about what we 're doing wrong . [ beat ] that 's what they should come here to look for .
i think that 's how it 's getting oxygen to him .
it does n't make any sense . it paralyzes him ... puts him into a coma ... then keeps him alive .
... so when the sheriff returned , you showed him the injury to the deceased 's head .
he said , 'could it be somebody hit him ? ' and i said , 'you want to play sherlock holmes , here ? '

i have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say , i believe everything , a little .
you let me go four years ago , jeff . only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by .
i 'd appreciate it if you 'd be out of here as soon as you can .
no ! he was crazy . i did n't -- he looked -- i thought --
okay , okay . take it easy . do n't freak out on me .
no one i 've run into knows what `` coyote ugly '' means .
maybe that bartender made it up . i mean i think coyotes are rather beautiful . maybe `` coyote ugly '' is really a compliment . like someone who 's conventionally `` ugly '' but is really beautiful .
oh . well , yes . it 's extraordinary . you think you could sign it for us ?
absolutely . you always wonder where your books end up . why do n't we use it ?

a ) it 's always the person you do n't suspect ; b ) that means you think it 's tex because you really suspect gideon ; therefore c ) if you think it 's tex , it has to be someone else -- gideon .
oh . i guess they just ca n't help it .
i 'm straight , joel . they have n't got shit on me . look , i 'm tellin ' you , he 'll take the deal somewhere else .
he could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash . he would n't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business .
how is the `` date night '' idea going over with eve ?
like gangbusters , doc . okay , i missed the last one .
forgive me . i suppose i 'm just naturally curious about a girl like that . she 's very rich , is n't she ?
i suppose so . her father owns a big newspaper in san francisco .

i think we 'd better go look for him . david !
the skin flake was found in michael 's restaurant . the employees are all accounted for .

i'11 tell you something else . the old guy in the wheelchair ? the stepfather ? they 're gon na have him die .
what do you mean `` they 're gon na have him die ? ''

well ! hear anything ? any sign of him ?
how 'd you like a punch in the nose ?
you can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry , because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back . when they are retreating before infantry , they merely trudge along , head down .

i 'm serious . i 've got a few ideas .
i can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch ?

you had me scared on the phone . what 's wrong with the baby ?
i think krueger 's trying to do something to it .
that involves a lot of extra work , does n't it ?
yes , but that 's an added service a firm like cedar , cedar , cedar and budington usually donates .
he 's going after debbie . i got ta stop him .

of course not . but -- how can i be efficient in the office if i do n't get enough sleep at night ?
it 's only eleven -- and i just want the place for forty-five minutes .
i was trying to be smooth . but at twelve-fifteen i was gon na come over there and talk to you .

those guys tried to kill me tonight . they were aiming right at me .
kids on a joy ride . happens all the time .
bear . the colombians are in l.a. seems they all upset about their money . that ai n't enough , as a bonus , it turns out the yoyo was escobar 's nephew .
that 's your problem . you shouldn't 've smoked the guy .
you are not in a band , barry . you are not a musician . and no posters .
thanks for your support , rob . really appreciate it .
if it 's attention you want i 'd say you 've got it . just one thing : why vega ? everyone 's looked at vega for years with no results , and now , yesterday , they start broadcasting primes . why ?
it 's hardly yesterday ; the signal 's been traveling for over twenty-six years . as for why ... i 'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there 's another message buried deeper in the signal .
i am almost an adult . this is what i want .
but kara , no one has ever gone from here to earth . the journey is dangerous .
look , go ahead ... put the radio on ...
amnesia ? you 're saying you do n't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago ?
the creed cat , that 's right . bastard 's name was `` church '' . let me guess . your dog 's tissue is n't healing , pupils are n't dilating ... maybe you ca n't find a heartbeat ?
exactly ! i thought it might be some sort of blood condition ... immune deficiency or ...
yes ... yes . that would be a great asset .
he will join us or die , my master .
chaz , listen to me -- we 've broken every rule of quarantine . if we bring an organism on board , we wo n't have a single layer of defense left .

eric , leave it alone . it 's not your business .
no way can he get away with this . i 'll be back by tonight .
yeah , but how am i gon na get my arm fixed ?
well , that 's a cinch . i know somebody that 'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth .
if i take something , you suffer . if i do n't , i stuff ... .
i know you can do it without sedation , you can , i know you can .
ah , yes , ah yes . our doctor lechter ... and have they sent you , once again to < u > capture < /u > him ? how terrible for you ...
no , sir , it 's not my job to capt ... why do you say how terrible ?
what do you mean ? it was incredibly romantic !
maybe it 's just me , but -- if you got to dress it up , it does n't ring true .
when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want . i 'll be long gone . besides , who 's going to believe you ? you 're just a two-bit crook .
and you 're a dirty cop . at least i do n't pretend to be something different than what i am .
if we beat the record , you might get a call back --
i 'll get it because i 'm a good actress , richard .
i was thinking i could fly up and spend a week in the big leagues with you -- help you get comfortable .

... should spend some time below , see more of the rest of the ship ...
... you see , i can watch things up here , doolittle . i love to watch things , just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids , gas clusters ...
get out of this room and get back to work .
i do n't have to listen to you anymore .
more like what happened ? what happened , mr. blank ?
i do n't know exactly . i could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization ... i thought you know ... maybe seeing you , some friends , my house ... of course now a 7-11 --
they 'll never make it . i mean , they ca n't manage when the cable goes out .
you 'd be surprised what people can do when they have too .
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain 's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she 's in the state she 's in today .
now , dr. towler 's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?
i wish , but it 's full . they recommended a pension in town . they say that all of taormina is full . what 's going on here ?
it 's the free diving world championship . i am by the way world champion !
how do you know the box pertains to hamunaptra ?

jackie ai n't got time for all that shit --
i 'm telling you what i have to do . what you have to do , in case you forgot , is come up with premium of a thousand bucks .
as i said , second of all you 're too skinny . you 've got tiny lungs . i still do n't understand how you can dive without getting sick .
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it !
the bar at the hotel ? she told you that ? what did she say exactly ?
well , dad , she said she wanted to suck my cock .
want to hear something great ? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower . it 's really gon na be fun .
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me .
these are my dinner guests . edgar and alan . the frog brothers .
ah ... i did n't know you were having guests ...
we 'll be on the street soon , charlie - another ten minutes .
it 's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
ah , doctors . what 's he gon na tell me ? ca n't trade my head in for a new one .
no , i guess you 're stuck with the one you 've got . have a seat .
it was just a shag , vanessa . you 're everything to me .
you just do n't get it , do you , austin ? good night . welcome to the nineties , you 're going to be very lonely .
boo ! ah , ha ha . ooh . boo ! ha ha ha .
i will bite my thumb at them ; which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
very moving , patterson ; i 'm touched you confided in me . but i do n't really give a shit about your upcoming litter . i 've made you with this assignment- -do n't make me break you .
you wo n't have the chance . any further words of encouragement ? then i 've a train to catch .
are you nuts , buffy ? there 's a hundred of them out there . they 'll rip us apart .
you 're staying here . some of them might not come after me . if they do n't this place is gon na turn into a total stain .
oh , no , i just lost a little weight , that 's all . well , you look nice .
you see , i-i 've been thinking about it and i think that we should get married .
hi ... .what ... .what 's up ... . ?
it 's ok that i 'm calling , right , i mean ? it 's ok .
any court in the land would understand . we 'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we 'll go to the police .
it will all be over in such a little while , jacqueline , and everything will be all right again . drink your coffee .
i 'm all out of liquor -- and there 's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing .
let me worry about that . just leave the key under the mat and clear out .
yeah , smaller countries do n't computerize customs records -
- so i watched europe . once you showed up in england..it was easy .
that 's a lot of cash . he came up with it pretty quick .
probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead . did you see how fast he ran out of here ? it 's done . he 's not coming back .
now , i want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles , okay ? 'cause that 's what 's gon na win this game .
turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin ' ...
i would n't bet against it . my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place .
like i said , all this for some twisted , distorted sense of principal . dunwitty , he just tolerates your negroidal ass , he does n't respect it .
dr. towler , who was in the operating room with you ?
ms. nevins , nurse-anesthetist ; dr.marx , of course ...
is that all this conversation means to you ? am i going to put out or not ?
damn straight . i 'm sick of playing games .
no place , fast . and you 're not coming .
come on , laura . i 'm your best friend .
oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us ? -- the whole thing seems to me to be very simple .
very simple -- i 've always liked the way you dressed , preysing -- english , is n't it ?
not yet . i had a phlemless morning . i hear he 's a pretty good ballplayer .
this game is pretty important to him . he made all-stars in high school , you know .
if it 's so fuckin ' dangerous , then why do n't you kill him ?
i 'm not gon na kill him . shut the fuck up . what , do you know what you 're talkin ' about ? i 'm not killing anyb-
oh , < u > c'mon < /u > -- even you have to admit this is weird .
no -- < u > this < /u > is weird .
i calculate that 's the end of this town . and let 's do n't bother about the luggage , darling .
i been having the boy at the hotel pack us up every night since your streak started
did kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath ?
did amy tell you she keeps her homecoming tiara by the bed ?
what is it about my writing that 's so rotten ?
mainly it has to do with your choice of words .
i wonder who 'll recognize us first ? they 'll wet their pants .
i hope the men do . i would rather the women did n't .
this is a business . get the fuck outta here .
i need to find my daughter . i 'll pay you .
please , penny . you just got ta trust me now . okay ? and do n't panic . because it 's gon na be all right .

i do n't know who else to turn to , auggie .
you do n't want to go home , do you ?
why are you doing this to me , rod ?
if i did n't know better , i 'd say you were sulking .
keep me off the couch , doc . your fees are a little rich for me .
the first drop will be made tomorrow . at twelve o'clock . the amount will be fifty million .
fifty million ! are we talkin ' united states dollars ?
you 're fuckin ' with me . i know you are .
'course i am -- but does n't mean i wo n't leave you here . if you believe anything about me , better be that .
gabrielle . no , i 'm sorry if i startled you . i came to think . god , did i hang up on you ?
oui . perhaps i called at a bad time . i am sorry .
i want the money back i 've thrown into this rubbish heap .
you are asking to burn these people ... you are asking ? ...
you 're gon na get electrocuted electrified ! the power 's coming back !
shut up ! you 're scaring me . stop ! you 're scaring me .
fuck you . fuck you , you get out .
i 'm not lying to you , i 'm not --
if you had n't come along and protected me when you did , i 'd have killed them fellows .
go and get yourself washed up , mr. bernstein . there does n't seem to be an serious injury .
we 've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public , it 's been decided not to expand the search at this time .
do n't let them do it this way , george . it 's too important . we ca n't find this thing alone .
[ beat ] i know it does n't make sense . it does n't even make sense to me .
if you do n't get out of my house right now , i 'll call the police .
you getting scared because some people do n't like what you are doing ?
yo , dela , they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece .
well , where was he ? where did he go ?
do n't know . looked for him for a bit ... could n't find him .
not so bad . we 'll get you to medical quarters . you 're going to be fine .
i ... i do n't think i 'm going to make it sir ...
who am i ? you 're asking me ? you 're the big expert for chrissake ! i 'm what ? the `` scumbag , '' right ? the sleazebag something or other , the blackmailer , the ...
was it you ? in the plane ? who saved my life ?
excuse me , but i folded these things beautifully and i would appreciate a little respect . jesus christ !
do n't look at me , pal . i got ta live with her .
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .
what if it never happens ? what if they 're so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? -- this place is gon na be one giant cemetery .
yeah , you already told me that . you cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk .
no , we do n't talk . i do n't make bad bets . seventy-five , twenty-five . that 's it .
turn up the fucking music ! my heart feels like an alligator ! volume ! clarity ! bass ! we must have bass ! what 's wrong with us ? are you goddamn old ladies ?
you scurvy shyster bastard ! watch your language ! you 're talking to a doctor of journalism !
you lost a man we wanted for some time . it was very incompetent on your part , officer .
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms , carrying official documents .
oh , there 's a hard tale , jack . most of the decent pirates in town wo n't sail with you -- seem to think you 're a jinx .
now where , i wonder , would they have gotten that idea ?
would'ya look at this babies ? made 'em myself . holy water , silver shavings , white oak : the works .
behind this door . a dark entity -- evil , ancient and hungry .
the one you came up to ask ... are we on schedule ?
take note mr. mason ... this is why you hire a professional ... no whining . no excuses .
let me come with you , doctor , please ! i do n't want to stay up here alone .
all right then , quietly ! close your robe and stay right behind me . do n't make a sound !
howdy , squire ! howdy ! oh -- how do you do , squire .
how do you do , belle ? how are you , jabez ? well -- mighty elegant house you got here .

'be deliriously happy ' . i 'm going to do my upmost --
from today on , our lives are different ! we 'll be swimming laps in the same pool jean harlow did .
i do n't know . it 's so much money ...
you said it was a strange world . and you 're the strangest part of it . are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder . this gives me the creeps .
settle down . i have a plan which i think will work . there is very little for you to do , but i do need your help . .are n't you curious about my plan ?
and this is ... ... clark . my friend is around here somewhere , i 'll just look for ...
i 'm sorry , i 'm in a real hurry . see you around , pal .
right . and they know him . and that 's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
i 've had it with you . i 'm leaving .
in nomine patris et filius , et spiritus sancti .
forgive me , father . for i have sinned .
i 'll need an office on the grounds ; someplace to store my things .
if you do n't mind my asking ... why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my ... our ... affairs ?
well . i have no way of knowing . so it does n't matter .
i do n't lie , jack . i 'm about 5'8 , blonde 34,28,34. pretty thin , i work out . my pussy 's shaved . my friends say i 'm pretty cute , so ... .

there 's nobody holding you here , mr. doe . it 's only natural that people
well , if there 's nobody holding us here , let 's get going . incidentally , my name is n't doe . it 's willoughby .
to hell with procedure ! we paid a bloody fortune for this slut , and we can do whatever the hell we like with her , whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear ?
but if this trial seems fixed , i fear you 'll have the very opposite result to the one you want ...
no , no ... it was very ... er , nice .
now i want you to be absolutely , totally , genuinely honest with me . did you really , truly , honestly like it ?
anything happened ? i 've got to get dressed ! i ca n't meet her like this !
but she is n't due for an hour , sir .
would it help if i got out and pushed ?
do n't worry , your holiness , i 'll get her started .
wait . i 'll send a patrol with you .
fine . but they 'll have to take care of themselves .
if you have a concussion you should n't sleep .
it will be okay if i sleep . i need to lie down and sleep .
ssssh . brad 's probably asleep by now . do you want him to see you like this ?
like this - like how ? it 's your fault . you 're to blame . i was saving myself .

wally . this is danny witwer . he 's from justice and we 're to give him a full run of the farm .
i 'll let you know the next full moon .
you 're to be discharged tomorrow . will you be all right ?
christ almighty , george . feed her a cheeseburger or something . what does she weight , eighty pounds ?
i know . she needs to slow down . she 's going to blow an o-ring .
he 's out there somewhere , causing trouble just to upset me .
you 're imagining it . you 're letting things prey on your mind .
do n't they ? he 's down at the tombs right now .
say , if you 're stringin ' me , old-timer ...
i think so . something besides your husband 's death was bothering you . you were upset but not that upset .
mr. gittes ... do n't tell me how i feel .
that you were forced to retire because , uh -- a sex scandal .
a homosexual scandal , you mean ? for me to answer a question of that magnitude , you 'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks .
gentlemen , i will not hear this . i value bill as much as anyone here . we all need to make room for someone else 's ideas , lou , especially me . maybe oswald is what everyone says he is and i 'm just plain dumb wrong .
i 've seen him copying files , leaving here late at night .
we ca n't . those sons-a-bitches control the rights .
they do ? shoot . there < u > must < /u > be a way to get around that ...
she knows you love her mr. parker . she knows now .
no more words . until i touch the ocean with my hands ... it 's all just words .
hey taylor , you do n't know it but i saved your ass today . i killed a shit-eating dog .
that reminds me , i got ta take a shit .
do n't get sidetracked . stay with the nite owl .
she may still be alive , whoever she is .
look , i appreciate what you did for me . but this is my job . and i 'm keeping those pictures .
all right , i 'll develop the photos . anything i do n't want is yours .
girl one of these fools has an fbi badge on him ! is this the one that was doing the inspection ?
hold up , hold up , i 'm getting shots over the scanners , tons of traffic -- jus ' chill for a sec , lem me listen ...
no , i do n't mean like that -- i mean something nice , like , that 's all --
you daft cunt . if you 're going to waste it like that , you might as well leave it all to me . now get the drinks in .
you 're a good salesman -- but i 've got to think about it .
a good insurance salesman would n't give you time to think .
listen , first off , is anybody hurt in there ?
... but you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time ... you got it ? okay ?
okay , you 've seen me . now go away .
david , i 'm sorry i upset you yesterday , but you must understand what is going on .
it 's early . why do we have to go home ?
bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want ... well 'til eleven thirty maybe .
just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually , we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise .

first . it 's our first . i 'm just concerned . so ... why are you killing yourself ?
interesting choice of words . i do n't remember . i just know that i want to .
lainey , there 's no evidence that simone is n't real .
listen to what you 're saying , mom . is there any evidence she is ?
she is a beauty , my lord , as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg .
my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg . i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex . is she fertile ?
whatta ya know . bayside , born and raised .
i thought these things were for talkin ' around the world .

your kid brother got married last sunday , eh , marty ?
that 's right , missus fusari . it was a very nice affair .
he led what i suppose was an orderly life . he ... ate a balanced diet .

i think to myself what problems could she possibly have ?
do n't let me get started on my childhood . oh , you know what ? there is a bookstore .
`` are not capable of love '' is what you mean .
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream .
you 're dealing with a psychopath . he gets out of jail in ten years , or five ... or ninety days , and you 'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life ...
what am i supposed to do ? ! i saw one of my oldest friends get killed ! and i saw who did it ! i ca n't just -- `` let it go away '' ! !
you said it like it was a big joke , bob . like he 's wild .
no , i was saying crazy like a lunatic .

you called us , doctor , if you do n't want to look at them here , how about downtown . i 'll drive you down ...
shredded . sorry . decided to whip up one of my own : a group so hungry for money that they 'd be willing to do anything . i thought you 'd be more comfortable with your peers .
i guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you . well , congratu-fucking-lations , steven : round one , you win .
that guy 's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that .
no shit . i better send meg flowers just in case .
uh ... no , i poop too much . then i get tired .
well , if you find yourself getting tired , take a couple of these .
cops . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there 's always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?
he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .

if we act too anxious , he 'll make us wait . he 'll let the senator keep hoping , day after day , until catherine finally washes up . that 'd be the most fun of all .
i think he means it , this time . i think he 'll deal .
you know if i were accused of carving up two people , i 'd take the opportunity to skip school .
hey , go easy , tatum . he did n't do it .

i 'd love to hear them . maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening , after work --
well i 'm the doctor . i 'm the one who 's going to decide what is , or is not important here .

how long do you think commodus will let us live once he 's in power ? a month ? half a year ? paestum will be a prison where he 'll hold us until it 's time ...
so mr. kirby , tell me , when you climbed k2 , did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet ?
thirty-thousand , i think . closer to the top .
the commission do n't decide how i spend my honeymoon .

it 's going slow , sir . it 'll be well into tomorrow .
not good enough , scotty . you 've got to do better !
no . this works better . with you gone and i do n't have the money , he ca n't touch me . but i can sure touch him . after i find him i 'll come and join you .

i wan na live with a musician . she 'd write songs at home , ask me what she thought of them , maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes .
... maybe a picture of me in the liner notes ...

can you do that ? i mean , do you know anything about puppetry ?
so what do you think , doctor ? i 've shown a lot of improvement , have n't i ?
you see , sarah ... here 's the problem . i know how smart you are , and i think you 're just telling me what i want to hear . i do n't think you really believe who you 've been telling me today .
i had suggested that they tone down the program so that the `` guests '' might take longer to expire .
i want more action . i want to see more ingenuity than that . i want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
no , as a matter of fact you did n't . what about the girl , zuzu petals , how does she fit in ? i mean , she is what this case is about .
i wish i knew . you did good work ...
i guess . walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things .
you 're really good friends with the chancellor , are n't you ?
edie , your old man 's right , go back to that school out in daisyland . you 're driving yourself nuts you 're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself .
look out for number one . always number one . i should 've known you would n't tell me . pop said johnny friendly used to own you . i think he still owns you . no wonder everybody calls you a bum .
boy , you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer .
serial killer is not really accurate , ma'am . the killer has yet to strike twice .
well , at least you did n't lose your lunch over a bug . how embarassing .
who cares about bugs ? you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't know math .
it does n't matter how . i was driving a stolen car --
do you enjoy doing this to me or what --
i owe it to myself to go right to the edge , rob , and this group does exactly that . over the edge , in fact .
you 'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next friday night .
so , what 's up with you ? another busy night selling porno to wireheads ?
no , wrong ... i sell experiences . sex is only part of it .
of course . he 's going to steal the giant white diamond .
no , robin . he 's going to jail .
why the hell did he do that ? what the hell did i do ?
i guess he did n't appreciate your use of language . they do n't speak that way on television . it 's a rule . do you realize you 've cut off a valuable source of communication ?
it sounds gay , but guess since you 're a girl it 's okay , huh ?
yeah , it will be fine . i wan na check something out . will you come with me ?
well , i thought they were more like a cantaloupe .
ha ha ha , that 's some idea , a cantaloupe .
paul ! where is he ? can you see him ?
i 'm trying ! that thing took him down this way !
we 'll keep it quiet ; the people who know are trustworthy ... the committee need n't find out .
and what 's the price of their not finding out .
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin ' . how far did you want to go ?
i ai n't really thought about it too much i do n't reckon .
evan . he 's a mucky-muck union official from massachusetts . you 're lucky .
do n't know about lucky . the guy 's a full-blown asshole . pay 's good , though . $ a day . i got to guarantee a kill , of course . which i can do . there 's some monster bucks hiding out up there .
anna is an excellent swimmer . even with a cramp , she would have managed to reach shore somehow .
but you have to consider all possibilities , sandro .
i 'm sorry i messed up . you 've been very kind to me ... but all good things have to come to an end , right ?
no hard feelings , okay ? it 's a small place , and i ca n't get my work done with you around .
clemenza ? no , i do n't believe it .
you 're right , kid , clemenza is okay . it was paulie .
is it being deliberately cruel , you mean ? i do n't think so .
i 'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances .
no , no , no , you said `` the number four with a smile , '' and there 's no `` the '' at the front of the title of the album .
it 's a reference to a chinese meal in toronto and i think that there is a `` the . '' but i could be wrong .
mt . mckinley . it 's also the highest point in north america .
okay , maybe she is psychic . let 's go eat !
what ? i think i 'm saying it . something 's going on . he 's either converted to christianity -- or to something else .
i suggest you ask dickie that yourself . otello 's is on delle croce , just off the corso .
so you see , everything is in order , is it not ?
not . do n't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities . we 'll be back .
we 're inside a recognizer ... you are crazy -- stealing a recognizer --
are you kidding ? i think it 's stealing us -
you see the old woman ? that will never happen to you . you 'll never grow old . you will never die .
and it means something else too , does n't it ? i shall never , ever grow up .
i need my shoes in total focus right here and also joe back there -- !
i know what you want but it ca n't be done !
we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes .

okay , i wan na see the hands . i wan na see which of you birds has any guts .
everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand .
look at us . we are old men now . but once we were young . and when we saw injustice , we fought it .
we have grown wiser with age . now we know that some problems can not be settled with a sword .
i do n't know the kid , and what little i do scares me .
he 's good people , mr. reuben . i swear .
thanks , dad , this talk helped . will you sign it , please ?
would it help if i got you a tutor ?
hey mav , this is sally . she does n't believe a word i say . tell her i 'm married , will you ?
yeah , he 's married -- but then again , he , s not dead .
all the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering .
you never know what 's in the heart and just because you can cry does n't make you human .
i dunno about this ... what will my mother think ?
she 'll say , `` now my son is a man . ''
but to go to war over trade , over money ? surely there 's still time for a compromise .
of course , if it were that simple . these people ? they 're after something else ...
you should n't have talked to norbert that way .
you 're thinking with your brain instead of your body . that 's why you 're so tense ! forget norbert . relax . it 's body time .
if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
if i talk too loud it 's the fault of the nuns .
look , how many times can i say i 'm sorry ? i blew it ! i thought she was rich .
that 's a good reason to dump your girlfriend .
please go and tell your master that we have been charged by god with a sacred quest , and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the holy grail .
well , i 'll ask him , but i do n't think he 'll be very keen . he 's already got one , you see ?
i was on the team at school . i was never very good , though .
we 're not always as good at things as we 'd like .
sure ... sure , mr. eddy . you gon na pick it up later , or tomorrow ?
if you think you can finish it , i 'll be back later today .
almost got knocked out of the sky over big k .
i like it . it 's kinda ... you .
i 'm only a laundress ; not a detective .
now 's not the time to be cheeky , maddy .
she 'll be with her friends over at stu maker 's tonight .
watch her . do n't let on -- just keep your eyes out .
you cost me my livelihood . that on which i relied to support my children .
if your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to hard copy , i hardly see how i am to --
i did n't turn her into mother . you did .
this person and i are a thing of the total past . i promise you .
fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome . it 's something we all have to learn to deal with .
but i did not deal with it , sir . i let it prevent me from helping my friend . does that make me a coward ?
son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen . would n't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire . problem 's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue .
trychticholorate . then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder .
what he means is , it 's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes . it lives in the mind .
yeah , but you got ta know what it 's about , right ? i mean , if you did n't know what it was about , why were you writing it ?
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein . the love affair that shocked europe ! see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit ! see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican ! never has the screen dared ...
if you do n't stop , i 'm going to kill you .
is n't it enough you told me you 're a fairy ? do you have to rub my nose in it ?
i assure you , mr. boone , i meant no --
just being there where it really happened . it was different ... more visceral .
mmm ... i love it when you talk like that .
forget it , jani . it 'll never work .
the point is , they want a man inside .
i can not tell you . suffice to say is one of the words the knights of ni ! can not hear !
how can we not say the word , if you do n't tell us what it is ?
do you think they have somebody to back up cicci ?
no . but if they do have somebody , you 'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name .
peggy ! what 's the matter ? who is it ?
it 's grandma . i ca n't talk to her now . i 'm sorry , grandma .
it 's weird being the groom . all these things kimmy has to take care of ...
you need a baby-sitter . that 's what i 'm here for .
all right . when < u > is < /u > a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup ?
when it falls off the table and turns turtle -- cute ?
you 're driving around north beach for no particular reason and this car wo n't get out of the way --
i do n't think she meant to go off the hill , do you ?
if you want to see me you will not do this . you will make an appointment ...
explain to me how you can diagnose someone as `` obsessive compulsive disorder '' and then act like i have any choice in barging in .
i 'm dying to see what you 've got to teach me .

i do n't know if i can with my leg .
well , there 's only one way to find out . give it a little gas .
fine , you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear .
reiben , you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes .
so what are you gon na do tonight , marty ?
i do n't know , ma . i 'm all knocked out . i think i 'll just hang arounna house and watch ...
what about the owner of the house ... ... this john diebold , any idea where he might be ?
no , but i can tell you he 's not gon na be too happy about this .
why the fuck , outta all the god forsaken shit holes in mexico , did you have us rendezvous at that place ?
i do n't know , one place 's as good as another .
they ca n't pull this on me . it is n't fair -- i do n't believe this --
he paid the hospital bill when you were born . your mom always calls you `` our beautiful daughter '' in the letters she wrote to him .
no , not so fast . we have nothing concrete .
when did that ever stop you ? you ca n't sit on this . this is huge .
phyllis , i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to shout ...
no , dr. delbanco , it is i who am sorry . sorry to have wasted your time with such ...
case ? so far i have n't seen a damn thing .
bill , keep shootin ' your mouth off and i 'll knock you into the middle of next week .
yes , so you said . but what does that mean : to go beyond the institution .
if < u > he < /u > could overcome ... his need for ... for self- < u > ratification < /u > ...
it is only too possible . love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult , and it is even more difficult to make it last .
i agree ; but god put us on earth to take that risk .
yeah , i guess he still lives with her . seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so i went out on a limb and got him transferred down to providence .
and you think he could find out her number for me ?
yes , i heard about poor warren . tragic .
you were partners with him on some slag -- uh , newcomer real estate thing .
he 's obsessed with his own image . he wants his nobel peace prize a little too much . as the late `` doctor '' king proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press .
jesus , i 'd like to book him into a psychiatrist 's office . he comes in here ranting and raving , dumping his crap all over the place ... could you prove it , edgar ?
i do n't think so .. he said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
who ? probably angelo .. i 'll take care of it .. do n't worry , we- 're gon na find this guy , and everything 'll be o.k . .. o.k . ?
try an ' hold it , man . squeeze your ass cheeks together .
butterflies , my ass . i 'm about to go home .
it was my finger that pulled the trigger , but i 'm not morally responsible . my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of . how could i know . i 'm not a doctor .
you seem very savvy for a man who 's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial .
i tell you , this station will be operational as planned .
the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation .
tell me a joke funny man . hee hee .
i caught your show down at the velvet room at the holiday inn , loved it when you busted into viva las vegas .
i know who you are . that 's why you paint your face . to hide .
i 'm not hiding . i 'm right here .
said he 'd heard you were up in town . wondered if i knew where you was staying . wanted to look you up . old time 's sake .
that 's nice . what 'd you tell him ?
you were right jahn , it 's a great space ... .. hey , chris . do you want to come and look ?
no thanks , i think we ought to get going though .
you wan na have a drink before we start dancing ?
listen . you people go grab a table . i 'll be back inna minute . i 'll be right back .
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light . this bucket of blood .
you can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody . i know where i made my big mistake . i have a general rule , never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you .
not me , man . i 'm no drug dealer , what you think .
i think you did n't get that lot in the navy , doing your national service .
no , i meant you did n't have to tackle me and rip my dress . a polite push , perhaps ? a clear shout of `` watch out , anna '' would have done nicely ...
excuse me , milady . i would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud , but i left my cape at the cleaners .
rarest pistol in the world , larry , a luger . only six were ever manufactured .
congratulations but rarer still is your interest in anacott steel .
can i see the map ? my father spoke of references to a beast god ...
kong is a myth , nothing but a native superstition , miss darrow . all we 're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts . now , if you 'll excuse me , i 'm trying to reduce my handicap .
have you reported to your probation officer as directed ?
i never saw him . why did n't he show up ?
mrs. -- thorwald 's -- clothes . -- clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable .
did n't you take it to the crime lab ?
they do n't want the classic horror films anymore . today , it 's all giant bugs , giant spiders , giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense !
the old ones were much spookier . they had castles , full moons ...
her psychiatrist ... said ... she needs security now ... stability ...
i ca n't say he 's been all that effective with her .
can you get me on a flight thursday night ?
we 're looking into it bob , but they really want you to stay to do that talk show friday , apparently it 's a really big deal , he 's the johnny carson of japan .
must be nice . so , what 's he like , is he like john ?
no , not at all . actually , i do n't think john likes him much anymore . he said he thought graham had gotten strange .
that 's a fine goal , i 'm sure ... but it seems to me a ship like that -- -- makes this one here just a wee superflous .
oh , the dauntless is the power in these waters , true enough -- but there 's no ship that can match the interceptor for speed .
he 's gone . it 's over . please do n't die , nancy . please .
i 'm so proud of you all . tell neil i ...
one thing , mr. klaatu . suppose this group should reject your proposals . what is the alternative ?
i 'm afraid you have no alternative . in such , a case the planet earth would have to be -- -- eliminated .
i did n't ask him to come ! it 's like i said , thelma , he just loves the chase .
well boy , he 's got his work cut out for him now , do n't he ?
ruining everything , that 's what they 're doing . you could choke on the diesel smoke already !
ian , nothing we observe will be valid if we 're trailing along in the wake of an army .
to repress one 's feelings only makes them stronger .
you 're right , but i do n't know what to do . i want to be with you ... just like this . it gives me a sense of peace .
what do you think , george , shall i resign ? it 's what they want .
do n't do anything rash , please , benedict .
spiro t. agnew was vice president , i believe .
that 's probably not the problem , then . what about your lifestyle . any major changes recently ?
and i 'll want to leave an early wake-up call .
no problem . my husband gets up the crack of dawn . it 's his kidneys .
it does n't matter . all they get is veronica lake . you got the real lynn margaret bracken ... where 'd this come from ?
when i was ten , my old man threw a bottle at my mother . i guess i got in the way .
blow-dart hunting stick from papua new guinea . very < u > very < /u > rare , since the tribe 's extinct .
'cuz they could n't hunt shit with these things , be my guess .
i had a minute before the mapp hearing -- but i could n't get you on the phone , eddie ...
yeah , well i had reasonable cause to believe the judge might 've heard of the fourth amendment .
well , they were wrong then , were n't they ?
you were sent by herr falkstein , were n't you ?
now phyllis , if you do n't invite me , i 'm coming anyway .
do n't be silly , cyril . these are respectable people . they 'd probably bore you to death .
no -- we 're from strange facts and mysteries . it 's a syndicated show out of..
paul . i thought we agreed . no press .
hey , do n't squish it , and after it 's dead , flush it down the toilet , okay ? and flush it a couple o ' times .
darling , darling , i 've been killing spiders since i was thirty , okay ?
i have no proof that it was false data .
you have no proof that it was correct data .
what , are you trying to get rid of me ?
no ... no , it 's just that i should get going in a few minutes , and --
charlie , what do you think of richard norvik ?
is he gon na help you with that physics stuff ?
well , your uncle was chairman of the board of directors . they probably expect you to carry on .
i 'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on , that you 'll be right down .
and you can tell 'em as an afterthought that i want your resignation now !
sssh . wait , fred . what ? ... where ? ... where ? holy moses !
we 're in an island chain . it 's only a matter of time before we hit another one .
greer 's gone . he broke out of the tank .
everybody knows why she went over tod . you jibed the boat .
i was trying to get her up wind ! that 's what you do when you 're hit a-beam . or maybe you 're too stupid to know that !
but your friends are my friends . my friends are your friends . i do n't think it would work . you have a little something on your upper lip .
i know that your friends are my friends . i 've thought about that . you can have them .
oh , i do n't know . i think proms are pretty dumb .
'cause i thought maybe you and i could go if you were n't already taking someone .
i am , commander riker ... may i touch your hair ?
praetor , we 've come to romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance . if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation , i suggest you do so now .
you will run into the hotel and hide behind the u.n .
i swear , captain , one hundred thousand francs , enough for a house . i will get the money , you keep them outside .
well , austin , you 've stopped dr. evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe , and somehow you and agent kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair .
i 'd say that about sums it up , exposition .
i 'm here . the general is here . you are not alone .
i must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him i am not afraid --
tell me about him . you must have lernt something from him ! it had to happen for you as it did for me !
i learnt absolutely nothing . i was n't give a choice , remember ?
nothing really , but it 's interesting . they know each other . they seem to like each other .
maybe . but i think the yellow man is on drugs . i think frank supplies him .
yeah ; it was great money ... i could make a dollar a day , sometimes . but only in summer . when it got cold , i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing .
why ca n't i be like you jack ? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it . say we 'll go there , sometime ... to that pier ... even if we only ever just talk about it .
i used to think he was right about a lot of things but now i do n't know . i thought he was going somewhere but now i think i am wasting my time .
no , you guys are great together . he 'll come through , i 'm sure .
that would n't be a wise thing to do .
patience does n't run in our family . sam , i 'm going out there !
for somebody else , alright ? not for me . i do n't do that shit anymore .
then you should n't even be around it . you know , it 's ...
and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and ...
i ca n't go to work with my hair dyed pink . and i can afford to go shopping more now , and i 've met a couple people i like over the last year or so .
if i cut a deal , i 'm not staying in this country and i want holly to come with me . so , if she does n't come here today , you 're going to have to get her to me tomorrow ; after i call , promise ?
sure ... .anything else i can do for you ?
but there is a bright side though . if you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers , you 'll have so much experience to draw on -
and just think , when you get out in a few years , you 'll meet some girl , get married , and you 'll be so understanding to your wife 's needs , because you 'll know what it 's like to be a woman .
lady , i guess i had you pegged wrong .
do n't worry , you 're not the first . we better get out of here .
wait a minute , you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone ?
it was the vertebrae of a megatherium - found in asia .
i ai n't killed nobody . shall i rack 'em ? play a game , lupe ?
no time for eightball . i got your tip .
it 's ... the anniversary . that 's what 's going on ... take it easy on yourself .
i 'm trying . i really am ... sometimes i do n't even know why i came up here in the first place .
goddamn , merlin . there any part of the day you do n't smoke ?
there anytime you do n't got a mouthful of shit ?
i do n't have the figures in front of me , but yes , that sounds about right .
in fact , by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible .
i 've read scripts about detectives , but never met one . must be wild .
sometimes it 's frustrating . like this gregory jameson case . we do n't even know what killed him . i 'm putting together little details to see if we 're missing something .
yeah , you are . i can tell by the way you look at me .
i just do n't know what you 're thinking . i do n't understand your choices . you know , the police are looking for you .
dude , i 'm not supposed to make calls --
walter , you fucking asshole , we got ta go to pasadena ! come pick me up or i 'm off the fucking bowling team !
daddy ! i do n't think this is any of your business !
i would n't ask if i did n't have to .
the way i see it . well be arrested . go to prison . cash in on the home footage . secure a book deal . if all goes as planned , our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii .
a verdict and premiere all on the same day . i love it .
you 're the getaway girl . the money 's gon na get to you eventually . gon na be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it . but i ca n't do that without a gun . any luck talking to him ?
bullets or no bullets , he wo n't do it .
do you think he 'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars ? i think he would .
that scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler . he wo n't take a dime less than three hundred dollars .
because it 's sentimental tacky crap , that 's why not . do we look like the kind of store that sells `` i just called to say i loved you ? '' go to the mall and stop wasting our time .
what 's your problem ? what did i ... why are you --
no ? how many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money ?
there were two of us . i had the other guy killed . do n't need the competition ...
that 's a hell of a thing to say . why , rose ?
now look , boy , get a grip on yourself . rose had a good life . she found her . right , did n't she ? she triumphed over everything , what are you blubbering about ?
it 'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech .
it better be . last time you had me introduce a dead guy .
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers .
me too ! were you an army brat or something ?
mrs. torrance , i do n't think you have anything to worry about . i 'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny .
oh , yeah . oh , yeah , he seems absolutely fine now , but you should have seen him .
so what happened to the barbecues , and fishing ?
watch my lips , coz you 're not gon na believe this - < u > this < /u > is a rare occurrence . we have n't had a body in eighteen months .
be your sidekick , you know , and maybe eventually become a tv talk- show host .
tv talk-show host , ok. you were at sidekick eight seconds ago , then tv talk-show host . you 'll be a latin dictator in a bout a minute .
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat ?
when one approaches fifty , my dear , he is affected only by the cold .
she 's just nervous and worried . and you would be , too , if you had no job and no place to go .
something has got to be done or rose is going to be in this house forever .
i do n't know , dickie , i 'm just telling you what i --
go back ! go back to new york or call him if you can find a telephone that works , and tell him wild horses would n't drag me back to him or his shipyard .
so what am i supposed to do in the meantime ?
go in and talk to her . it ca n't hurt . go .
put that thing away or you 're going to get us all killed .
yes , your highness . i 'll let you open it then . it wo n't be too long before they figure out what happened to us . this has turned into a brilliant escape !
hey , did you hear what he said ? !
poor guy 's had one too many scouting missions .
i have n't had a key lime pie in ten years .
when ya had it , did ya like it ?
yes , i know what they make it out of , so what ? it 's food now . < u > you 're < /u > eating it .
i did n't say it was bad for you , it 's just kind of sickening , that 's all .
so ? that car wash pays good , and they 're always looking .
car wash ? ! that 's got no future . if we 're gon na take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that .
my father ? what the hell 's that got to do with my father ?
is that why you became a journalist ? then you get to ask all the questions ?
and what about this so-called `` barbara '' character ? it 's obviously me ! i 'm so embarrassed ! this is < u > our < /u > < u > life < /u > !
of course it is . and that 's why you should play the part .
wo n't do , love . it 's not spring . it 's nearly autumn..you 're in oz . everything 's upside down and backwards here .
maybe that 's it , then . everything 's upside down and backwards ...
i assure you , there 's nothing mysterious involved .
probably you 're right , but a little while ago , i was talking to a couple of lawyers who 'd been assigned to represent the burglars .
we all know what happened . in a fit of jealous rage you killed simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you .
no ! ! i can prove it to you . i 'll take you to her .
how do you think i got to be a colonel ?
work hard , be good at your job . sir . do whatever they tell you .
otis ! ! shostakovich identified with the jew . he felt persecuted , hunted , crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism .
not to mention andrew zhdanov ... otis , come ! !
you 'll have plenty of time for that , you know . figure it this way : twenty years in space and we 've only aged three , so there 'll be plenty of time to stare around ...
you know , doollttle , if we 're going into the veil nebula , we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing : the phoenix asteroids . they should be passing through there about now ...
tell me , mrs. kramer , are you employed at the present time ?
yes , i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer .
no . i only saw his back . he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall .
i did n't get a good look at him either , but he sure looked at me . i did n't have time to get a window , but i found this key . pretty nifty , huh ?
you shoved me away and ran out to the patio . i took you home .
but why ? i ca n't understand how i could just completely --
who the hell knows ? everyone 's giving orders . it 's all very democratic .
george , we 've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army .
up until now those smugglers were operating only around the palermo area . this will be a nice surprise for the lieutenant in milazzo ... call up headquarters . bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate .
so ... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers . could it be possible , then , that anna ... ?
i did n't dismiss you . i told you what i thought , but it did n't seem to matter , so you decide . besides , this is supposed to be my time with miles . i hope you 're not going to call every five minutes .
i 'm not going to call every five minutes , but this is important .
this is a daily paper , we 'll explain it tomorrow . you 're certain on mitchell ?
he approved the payments to liddy while he was still attorney general --
but i think i like you better this way ...
is this another one of those sun tzu art of war tricks ?
does he ever talk about medicine ? his patients , the hospital ?
all the time . it 's always `` loma vista '' this , `` loma vista '' that .
what 're you , a cop ? i 'm goin ' out -- business .
you fuckin ' worm , if you 're going out , i 'm going out .
i 'd never ask you for money , you know that . i do n't even like talking about it - money , favors - i find it very awkward , it makes me very uncomfortable -
no , look . it 's the others . they 're the ones causing these delays .
what a headstrong fellow ! well -- i guess you 're quite prepared to suffer the consequences .
i have still a year -- a year to make up for everything .
this is us . bank robbery . and you 're in the bank-robbery capital of the world --
last year in la county . up percent from the year before .
and he loves you back , does n't he ?
he 's a little spoiled , but i know he does .
fucking amazing , huh ? chevy nova , you bensonhurst shit ! still in la-la land . look at us , two rock 'n ' roll dicks . unfortunately , only one of us is a detective .
nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big , you redhook bastard .
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work .
i preached to mom and dad about it but they are stuck in their ways , it 's like talking to a brick . but if there is a way ...
we are not at war ! you and i and jaeger are awol . we have no authority --
he tried to kill us . if not just now , then in the helicopter . that 's all the authority i need .
wait ! did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant ... you had it , threw it out and you 're gon na go back and dance all night !
shut up , cleo . di , how much do you need for an abortion ?
and this class officer ... `` wickwire . '' you think he was just trying to get even ? striking back for ...

we 're very curious about that , too . would you care to talk about it ?
i 'd be glad to . not now , of course -- with you alone .
i do n't know how you put up with him .
he used to run the nasa . he knows where all the bones are buried . comes in handy .
we make our lives , one step at a time . we do the best we can . the truth about the future ? a promise . is only a hope .
how about the promises we make to our kids ? about < u > their < /u > future . do we shrug those off , just that easily ?
you like a little coffee with your cream and sugar ?
i 'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up .
well , if something was stolen , i should know about it .
no , no . nothing like that . i just need his name . terry i ca n't give you his name unless you have a complaint .
because he knew i could n't leave the case alone . and this way at least he 'd keep track of it . and me .
what about grunemann 's letters to the girl , everything like that ?
there was no wallet ... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings .
the guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but i do n't think that 's what they were there for . i think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands , george ...
father - may i ask you a question in private ?

i think you 're gon na find he 's taken the rest of his life off .
why she got ta be a ho , just cause she wants to get with me .
she 's a ho cause she 's sending her coochie through the mail .
that 's why the sealant on the doors ... so what have we got , a torch with a conscience ?
no , we have a stone killer trying to make a point .
you know , tom , i feel a little proud when people comment on your looks . maybe you should feel that way .
proud ? i 'm just embarrassed that i like when they say those things .
you talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid ...

let 's just say i 've done due diligence .
so , fine , it 's not that the jew , the jews own the media and the banks . it 's that they 're sexually corrupt .
this is your room , malcolm . i know you 'll keep it clean .
this is malcolm , our new guest . we 'll treat him like a brother .
what 's that little air bottle on the machine ?
that is n't for the divers actually . it 's for the balloon . it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator . without it , with the pressure at the bottom , the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed .
i commend you . if you 're going to pursue poofs , go after those who can do favors for you . you waste everybody 's time when you court dinosaurs .
do n't think that , mr. whale . i love your movies . that 's why i wanted you to come to this . so i could see you with your monsters .
thanks , kid . where are you goin ' now ?
i 'm goin ' straight . no more short cuts . theo gets into the car . buzz leans in the open window .
that 's bullshit . you 're a good teacher .
thank you , donnie . and you 're a good student . lazy ... but a good student . unlike most of the others , you question mom and dad 's rules .
that 's not what they 're tellin ' me .
that 's why they call it `` fuckin ' with ya . '' now you wan na hear how we retaliate ?

request permission to take the hood off , tommy .
he does n't deserve this ! you do n't know him . it is n't fair !
he thought he could take my place . it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i do n't think he 's man enough to do that .
yah , not too bad . so it 's nice up there ?
yah , it 's good . no pike yet , but it 's good .
so that was why she tried to run away .
did n't you know she had a father and mother out here ?
yes -- if i did n't believe that , i 'd die after last night .
i want to be good to you -- madly good .

not to me . sometimes , the world feels like a cage . then someone comes along and opens the door ... and it 's never monday night again ... i wish you and steve could like each other .
... you know that night we got hit ... i ...
fuck it , do n't mean nothing , no such thing here as a coward , done your best man , next time y'do better .
you 'd tell me if there was something wrong , would n't you , pumpkin ?

the star 's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector . however , none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon .
give me a list of those effects . i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed , no matter how insignificant .
come on -- everybody dumps on us workers . you soldiers get all the glory . plus you get to go out into the world , meet interesting insects , and kill them .
yeah , but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes .
then we 've got to get to the lifepods !
i 'd advise you to shut up and let me finish taylor . you need n't worry about the lifepods because they 're all gone , jettisoned . save for one .
i 'd like to see your friend 's face when we tell him . he does n't sound like much of a detective .
do n't be too hard on him . he 's a steady worker . i wish he 'd get there , though .
i do n't know . i do n't see what this has to do with me .
perhaps it 's because she has amnesia too - ca n't remember . . .
it 's not just for myself i 'm asking . her sister is here . the kid 's half crazy with anxiety .
as a man , you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician .
i swear to you i would n't have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case ...
what you thought ! ? what you thought ... i 'm a workingman , i 'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we 're paying you , i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ...

get him a room , but tell no one he is here . paul will look after you .
what do you want ? this is a private area ! get lost !
you ai n't got nothin ' i ai n't seen .
well , some of the children just do n't respond to step programs .

what do you read ? what 's the last book you read ?
lust for life . it 's the story of vincent van gough .
your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie .
oh , untrue , jeffster . i think , uh , two weeks ago we attended a concert where i had fucked two girls .
we can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few --
will -- it 'll go worse for us -- for elizabeth , especially -- if we fight .
so morde-chai , tell me , what brings your bad self down to the klf ?
i 'm back on the job for the jdl . you hear about that crazy white boy who took over as santa ?
warp drive as soon as possible , mr. scott .
captain , it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place . it will happen again if we do n't correct it .
ah , you fuck ! you 're such a fuckin ' asshole !
get the fuck out of here . get out ! get the fuck out !
i know honey . just remember what i said , we 'll bide our time . you just steer clear of him as much as you can . doyle 's had a real hard life . it 's just about run him crazy i think .

yah , no problem , i 'll just fax that over to ya , then .
when they emerge , a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable , if they are moth-balled in advance . i would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years .
but , look here , von klutz . wo n't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked , grief-stricken , and anguished that they will envy the dead , and indeed , not wish to go on living ?
no . look , we 're kind of ... .
that 's why i can talk to you , as an equal , sonny . you got to merge your whole soul with god . and then you are him and one with the holy ghost .
hey , what did you want ? a lot of fatherly bullshit ? a big pat on the back ?
from you , pard ? never . thanks for the graduation present .
it 's a package deal . you get the phone with the office .
detective mills here . honey ... i asked you not to call me here . i 'll call you back ... what ? why ?
i 'm saying , frank , in trying to figure out who you are --
-- there 's a lot more important things i 'd like to put myself < u > into < /u > --

i see you 've been out visiting the folks .
it 's hunt . what do you need for a pinpoint ? been watching a little t.v. , have you ?
now everything 's fine . she 's probably squawking her head off in some police station .
i do n't think she 's talking much ... you know what i mean ?
so since i 've never had sex with you , by your own advice i should n't accept your advice .
that 's correct . bit of a dilemma , is n't it ?
i 've been trailing the cashier like you told me . you 're right about that guy , chief . there 's something screwy somewhere .
never mind all that . what did you find out ?
sure i do . you were hot shit back in hickville , but here in the real world , you got squat . you do n't have a plan . you do n't have a job . you do n't have anything but the clothes on your back .
i 've got a whole backpack full of clothes !
well , i generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death 's back . so , tell me , fellow war-monger ... do you think princess bala likes men in uniform ?
well she better -- she 's engaged to one . < u > me < /u > !
if god intended our proximity to asia , do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ?
did he not choose a carpenter 's son to reveal himself to the world ?

characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort .
no secrets , goddammit ! you do n't hold back from me . whatever is going on , you 're gon na tell me now !

if there really is someone else in this house , i think the four of us can handle the situation .
i think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation !
come on , mark , every cunt knows you 've been saving up down in london .
sorry , boys , i do n't have two thousand pounds .

thank you , your honor , i 'll continue . dr. thompson . did you examine deborah ann kaye last night at the northern chronic care facility ?
... so when your dad said , `` i never want to see your `` f-'in ' faces again ! '' do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up ?
i do n't know ... and what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table .
really ? god ... i would n't know where to start ... and yet ...
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind .
the kuala lumpur ferry was miles off-course that night . captain blamed the auto-pilot ; i suspected he was drunk - until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem .
did you test the auto-pilots ? the satellite positioning receiver ?
when you kill cong , do n't you feel something .
sure . recoil ... i feel the recoil of my rifle .
i think i 've got it . once i get going , i 'll be okay . but ... how do i get started ? i mean , i hardly know her .
you wuss . it 's no problem . one person says something to the other and that 's how it starts ...
it 's not that simple . lyle , play the recording for dr. weir .
navigation control tried to hail the vessel . this was the only response .
i know that part . tell me something i can use , here .
i 've watched you once or twice . you surf like it 's some kind of street fight . you jerk along from moment to moment , fighting everything that comes at you . always trying to win .
my problem is i come here to drink in peace . so if you do n't mind ...
c'mon , valiant , does n't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you ? i mean , no offense , but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place ?
look around you partner ! you said yourself you never saw anything like it .
we do n't know whose money it is ! they might have robbed a bank , who knows ?

stars ... when a sun is far away , we call it a 'star . '
i 'm just trying to find ... who owns this store ?
i do n't know . look , man , if you 're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops .
what about the guy you lobotomized ... did he get a refund ?
you 're talking ancient history , doug . nowadays , traveling with rekall is safer than getting on a rocket . look at the statistics .
mr nedry , mr nedry . the embryos have to be back here in san jose by then .
that 's up to your guy on the boat . seven o'clock tomorrow night , at the east dock . make sure he got it right .

i could n't face her if i had slept with somebody else .
oh , yes . i know about mr. rawlston .
he knows the first mrs. kane socially - that 's the answer we got .
pretty much the same reasons i was crying . but things will be better when we move to a new place .
then i 'm gon na do what you do to make me feel better when i 'm sad .
so , hi there . i 'm ... sister mary clarence . and you 're ... young christians . i guess i should assign you this passage . what 's good ? what were you talking about ?
we were talking about the wild thing . teen promiscuity .
just one more explosion like that and you 're gon na see a dead body ...

i ca n't . the radio 's at the bottom of the shaft . but frank 'll be looking for me soon . when he gets here i 'll contact everybody from the chopper .
that 's no good . it 'll be dark soon , there 's no other shelter for ten miles . if they show , they 'll take you too . why 'd you have to come up here ? !

that was a good one , dad . that was really something . remember that ?
have a good time . do n't make it too late .
anything you say , ma'am . have a fun shower . use soap .
and you sure you can control this thing ? last time did n't work out so well .
with the right energy , we can stabilize the storm . maybe tie into the city grid ...
why do n't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary ?
i do n't know . maybe they do n't leave a canary . do n't be technical . what i 'm saying is if this newsstand guy 's italian and his fingers are gone , maybe he 's a thief .
there 's more ! there 's a couple stuck in there . i know there 's more .
god , i 'm telling you , they 're out !
just for laughs we raided wonder boy 's house . there was a gallon of one of the corpse 's blood in his carpet . i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year .
what 's all of this got to do with me ?
well , if she 's got any sense at all , she 'll listen to that .
sense does n't mean anything to rose . but i think we 're on safe ground now . daddy chained up the ladder , whoever it is ca n't get in the house .
it 's a tightrope , spud , a fucking tightrope .
my problem is that i tend to clam up . i go dumb and i ca n't answer any questions at all . nerves on the big occasion , like a footballer .
no , you do n't understand , i saved a mannequin .
-- that really was incredibly work you did . you and your brother , fighting fires together , helluva image , is n't it ? you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command .
joking ? no , ma'am . oh no ! i mean business !
i 'm sorry . i thought you were -- never mind -- i 've never actually been there , but let me see , you take the seventh avenue subway , i think , to the end of the line ...
they got to stop < u > sometime < /u > ... if they 're human at all , they got to stop !
naw ... a human man rides a horse till it dies ... then he goes on afoot ... a comanche comes along ... gets that horse up ... and rides it twenty more miles ... then he eats it .
no secrets , mister harding . let 's get it all out in the open ...
i mean , the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having . i know that to be the case , but the way in which you broached it , if that 's your idea of teaching me something ...
only two ? man , i already done eight . nothin ' to it . just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves .
i did three hitches in the navy . it ai n't bad . after a while , you get used to it and the time --
i went through this with an investigator this morning . if i could --
mr. zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme . we believe he passed you sensitive materials , possibly with your knowledge , and we need to --

i just do n't want to see you get your hopes up . you know how you get .
stephen , you got ta stop just showing up on the roof like this .
i just wanted to , i do n't know , not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since i do n't remember much of it --
well ... er ... i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby .
imagine the carpets of a self- respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik ! what does she look like ?
holy shit . you 're the first one that 's ever got that .
yeah , well ... i 'm an expert in name- ology .
i do n't know how to walk in heels .
hey . you just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight . let me worry about your date .
how 'd you get the tape ? why did n't the cops put it in evidence ?
with all the blood i guess they did n't see the rig . guy had it under a wig .
never been better . peter spent the night . i must really love him . he 's still alive .
oh thank god . maybe this whole thing is really over .
then we 've got ta start one . do you know how to start a war ?
sure , that 's easy . you got ta insult somebody .
that 's terrible . what a bitch . she was obviously just using you , terri . ready to dump you the second she had what she needed , interfering little whore .
no . it is n't ... she would n't ... it 's like i must have done something wrong , you know ? freaked her out . just fucked up something good again .
why do n't you catch a few murderers for a change ?
well , you could say that murder was part ...
they knew we were coming . golitsynís dead too . the disk is gone .

no way . everybody 's going sailing . if you do n't want to take me , just say so .
we saw at least thirty ... and there are twenty-two enterprise crewmembers reported missing ... including commander data .
we 'll have to assume they 've been assimilated into the collective .
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you ?
you do n't have to do a thing . chemically we are already quite sympathetic .
i asked you how you like your coffee ... ? we have black and bitter . as the soul of man . or light and sweet , as the world- view of the self-delusive .
we got a bunch of < u > materials < /u > , coming up at auction . materials which disappeared from dr. lechter 's cell , drawings he made , his < u > books < /u > .

he can handle the work , he can handle the pressure and he 's obviously handled you .
why is he hiding ? why is he a janitor ? why does n't he trust anybody ? because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most !
no , honey . i told him i was buyin ' a car . what is it for ?

how is our little student doing ? has he learned his lesson yet ?
i do n't know who you are or what you want . i just want to know what 's under that sheet ...
llewelyn would never ask for help . he never thinks he needs any .
carla jean , i will not harm your man . and he needs help , whether he knows it or not .
... nick , you 're the one that 's always saying you never go anywhere .
i was thinking the poconos , charlie . maybe vegas .
but now you 've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins . a subject on which you 're dangerously ignorant .
but i 'm a quick study . tell your deputy d.a . -- rabin ? -- that i 'll see him in court .
because i am the director . do n't you realize , if it was n't for my film , for my talent , my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now .
your idea ? i thought it was my idea .

well , god knows he tried , but i 've been rather firm with him , mummy . you did n't tell me he was so obsessed with sex . it 's bizarre .
you ca n't judge him by modern standards . he 's very much a product of his times . in my day he could have any woman he wanted .

now , you 've got more sense than to put nosey onto this guy -- !

he 's going back to the front this evening . i ca n't see him otherwise .
just go off . i 'll be quite all right .
no joke . fuckin ' army ! that goddamn war . i 'm still fightin ' it .
it 's not worth it . you 'll never win .
well , saavik . i guess this is goodbye .
yes , admiral . sir . i have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son . david died most bravely . he saved spock . he saved us all ... i thought you should know .
it will be human and it will look like this . but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know . that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have .
i told you it 's impossible for me to have a baby .
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance ... she ...
... that 's what the sister said . the chart said she ate nine hours prior to ...
i never said ... oh look . that 's just a figure of speech . she said something funny , and i said ...
and you accused her of tampering with your mail .
you ever take a bath with a man before ?
there 's a lot i have n't done with a man before .
sir , the charges are serious -- first , abuse of power ; second , obstruction of justice ; third , failure to cooperate with congress ; and last , bombing cambodia ...
they ca n't impeach me for bombing cambodia . the president can bomb anybody he wants .
... which i hope will make you very happy .
oh , i am happy , harold . ecstatically happy . i could n't imagine a lovelier farewell .
i have just come from the palace . the post has been filled .

you want the tapes for yourself . you 're going to sell them .
i 'm going to retire with a shit-load of money . find me a small country that does n't have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life .
you know , nick , you 've been something of a total asshole the past few days .
pardon me , i 've had a few things on my mind -- like putting this safari together .
damn , you 're a shrewd one . shrewd .
i just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it does n't have to be vietnam . you do n't get treated badly here do you ?
i brought it for him to autograph . he 's going to be amazed to see it - it 's one of two known copies ... i ca n't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner . what an insult !
this bar 's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from .
it 's all just business to you . him . me . your life . everything 's business .
it 's what i do for a living . it 's how i make money .
a hunch . things he said . like , knowing how to recognize a phony id --
-- recognizing phony id 's ? christ , powell , he could be a fucking bartender for all we know !
maybe if you did n't go rambo every time i did a lapdance , you 'd still be doing it yourself . meantime , i got ta feed my little girl .
maxie 's fucking with me . he put you with the spook to get under my skin .
i just wanted to ask him a few questions , that 's all . maybe i better go .
really , he 'll be home soon , would you like a cup of coffee ?
will he wish to know the details of this night ?
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it , and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him .
so , what brings you to a dive like this ?
it 's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little .
no , andy . do n't know the kid .
look again , billy-boy . this is jail bait . could get you in a lotta trouble .
oh god . don ! ! ! why ca n't i just die .
there you go again . stop saying that . you can make it .
yes , it is a mistake , because , you see , the bed , here , is my spot .
i need to repair my turbo boosters . do you people still use fossil fuels , or have you discovered crystalic fusion ?
maybe he likes you , ever think of that ? it 's good for you to go out -- get your mind off mark .
you 're so lucky you have george and do n't need to go on dates anymore .
but that does n't make you the boss of everything , son .
do n't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family ?
oh ... i do . yeah . it 's just that i told my `` dad '' i 'd clean out the rain gutters and mr. johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
i 'll be honest with you bud . i 'm getting sorta concerned about what i 'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
no ? i guess we 're not counting lying , stealing and murder .
you 've got the wrong idea about me . i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger . can you help me find him ? i 'll pay you anything .
quit stalling -- i want to see some identification -- now !
i would n't lie on a thing like that -- i could go to jail .
hey , why do n't you invite maya to the wedding ?
somehow i do n't think inviting maya to your wedding is the right move . in fact , after your bullshit , it 's going to be hard for me to even go to the hitching post again .
and a hundred thousand if i go to jail .
we 're partners , baby , sorta . i ai n't gon na screw you . you have n't told me where i put it for you .
i love it here . do n't you love it here , ryan ? i love it here . and i love tonight . and i love these people . and this feels utterly fantastic , ryan . utterly fantastic .
you know what sally therrian was saying about your spine and your brain ? she did n't pull that out of thin air . it causes brain damage . you 'd better drink a lot of water .
the rangers and dea are heading out to the desert this morning . you gon na join 'em ?
i do n't know . any new bodies accumulated out there ?
this is one of those interrogation tricks , is n't it ? you do n't give me a cigarette till i tell you more .
no , actually , i just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some .
suave . goddam are you suave , you fucker . you want some beer ?
certainly frank . darling , get some glasses . we 'll have some beer with frank . wo n't you sit down ?
that little winona ryder manner ... you 're more convincing as clint eastwood .
clint is putting a guard on you . but if you swear to leave the computer on , winona will assign him to the hall outside .
wing attack , plan-r. that 's exactly what it says .
check your code again . no one at base would pull a stunt like that , terry .
yes , that 's my name . who are you , young man ? are you supposed to be here ?
uh -- yeah . i 'm new here , and i 'm supposed to be in this class .
it 's the tide . it 's the dismal tide . it is not the one thing .
not the one thing . i used to think i could at least some way put things right . i do n't feel that way no more .
kapellmeister bonno , count orsini- rosenberg and court composer salieri .
naturally , the italians ! of course ! always the italians !
me and jill , we just had a little spat . she felt kind of left out , i guess , from not knowing some of the new kids --
where is she now ? is she in the truck with your friends ?
ah ! there you are , madam . were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday ?
was that the one with the st. christopher medal on the dashboard ?
that 's what i want -- a gaff rig .
gaff rigged ? why not a staysail schooner ? go anywhere . look at this -- the mayan , an alden schooner .
i do n't know if i should talk about this .
well , i 'd ask guy - we were friendly , you know - heart attack , was n't it ?
great . donovan actually said the words `` good work , ms. woods '' . he takes me seriously ! can you believe it ?
of course i can believe it . you 're going to make a great lawyer .
fascinating . what are your plans for this evening ?
thought i 'd stay in . there 's a good tittie movie on skinemax .
does she suffer ? does she know what she is ?
i do n't know . i once asked dr. maxwell the same question . he said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken .
you 're sayin ' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off ?
no , no . i - i 'd , i 'd - pay you back the principal , and interest heck , i 'd go - one over prime -
well , your worship , it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer .
i had nothing to do with it . general rieekan thinks it 's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from .
richardson wo n't do that . he 'll resign .
the hell he will ! fire him , too . if you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the justice department , fire the sonofabitch ! and ...
perfect , wonderful , good as i ever felt ! except for a big old scar on my stummick , i would n't even know i been in the hospital .
well , we know you were there . the bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous .
kid , you gave them what they wanted . this committee , it feeds on names . the more names , the better . but for some high-profile witnesses , like yourself , any name will do .
leo , i did n't give them the names . i would n't do that .
you always say that . then you go to work and forget you promised .
i never forget , honey . i try , real hard . it 's just , for some reason , i do n't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys , i end up falling short .
but you fuck with me . you fuck with me all the time . you make crummy tea . you rip us off on the hash .
i make special tea for you , hiyes , okay ? we 've to live like brothers . we have to be in here together .
she 's getting big . getting her own ideas .
i know . well , that 's all i really wanted to say . so , okay , then .
what happened ? ! jesus , connie , what did you do ?
nothin ' ! i told him he was great .
well , it wo n't work . love and understanding wo n't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet .
actually i want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet  one as a detective .
yeah . yeah . little winded . did you see that ? !
god yes , allie . i 've got ta say -- that was the ballsiest move i ever ...
yeah -- guess i got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster . you meet chad the nanny ?
yeah , i did -- am i dressed okay ? i guess i did n't realize we were ...
for that i 'd kill a nun on easter sunday .
just to get out of here ? that does n't seem much for a murder .
i do n't remember . i guess so . smells like it . tastes like it .
well , you 've been wet to the skin . you must 've fallen in .
and i thought it was something serious ! how could you frighten me so ?
it must be serious , swana . not long ago i 'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class . now i can say it without stammering , without a blush . i 'm in love , swana .
do n't know . looked for him for a bit ... could n't find him .
you 're saying he was n't put into the kennel until the night ?
do n't worry about it . your attitude sucks anyway .
hey , so for it . do n't let pity stop you . i 'm down . nail me .
spike . for god 's sake -- she 's in trouble -- get a grip .
right . right . you think it 's the wrong moment . fair enough . do you mind if i have a go ?
well , shall we start looking over the paperwork ? gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents .
can i use the facilities first ? being pregnant makes you pee like seabiscuit .
men looked up to him ... he died as he lived ...
his death was -- yes , he died as he lived .
after visiting congress i know what it 's like being violated by come disproportionate asses ! ah , if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table ...
we 're so damned important ! look at us -- nathanael , you were a horse- shoer , benedict , before this ?
they 've got to find shelter soon , and so do we . how are you holding up ?
you know me , i 'm a night person .
if you want her to stay out of it , then stop telling her everything . you should learn how to keep a secret .
she 's nosy . she hears me on the telephone .
you 're looking a wee bit green , thomas .
the sea and i do n't agree with each other . where we off to ?
well , i probably would n't say if i were , but no .
you ca n't be too careful . i 've been stalked . i 've been told i 'm highly stalkable . i do n't need that .
i do n't see why you ca n't just lock me in . it 's not like i can go anywhere .
either i 'm going to tie you or mars will tie you . which do you want ?
he 's got nothing to do with this . it 's me you want , right ?
let the hooker go . she 's not important .
me ? no , i think it 's kind of a stupid game . i mean , at least , i could never get into it . i tried it once .
huh . jack loves golf . crazy about it .
what 's it look like ? we 're going in .
going in ... are you out of your mind ? there 's hostages in there -- for all we know --
this is your desk set . i do n't get it .
they gave me the exact same thing as last year !
no can do . life goes on , pointfive ... you left me , remember ?
i left town . i did n't leave you .
finally , i get a waiter who does n't know `` macbeth '' .
but i know you , do n't i ? i seen you on a poster in the theater district . i 'll think of your name in just a --
because i go to trial in seven weeks . i 've got a lot of preparing to do .
no one 's asking you not to work . i just think you could make some time for your son .
trickery and divinity . yeah , he says that all the time .
that 's because he knew . he 'd seen these files and knew .
could n't you arrange to make a little less noise ?
i tell you , we 're going west , and shanghai is east of here !
did you not tell vada i 'm a womanizer huh ?
oh , i 'm running late . shelly 'll be here any minute .
he 's an idiot , and he 's not nearly as hard as he thinks .
how tough you have to be to make the army ? all you 've got to do is shoot a gun , and stop a bullet .
i do n't know . the cheeks maybe ... look a little --
cheeks ? cheeks ? right . too much , you think ?
probably slipped her moorings , got tangled up in a current .
out here ? what , so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now ?
well , it is n't much , but if you insist , here 's this week 's .
`` boy stuff . '' why , printer 's ink runs in your veins , jeff . you 're just like your father .
the right guy is out there . i 'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him .
yeah , but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion .
i 'm from arkansas . tell me a story with robert e. lee in it and maybe i 'll pay attention .
we 're warriors , not desk jockeys . we 've got to be bold . you always want all your ducks lined up . but nothing 's percent . it 's always 60-40 , maybe 51-49. hell , i 'd take 40-60. then roll the dice .
no , your mother did , then i did after she passed .
well , i 'm the first one to admit that i do n't know anything about bookkeeping , but there are some very interesting things in here .
it 's against your rules that i try to help a witness who 's scared shitless ? who 's ...
the woman 's unstable . you could wind up with a harassment charge . < u > anything < /u > . you 're like some horny little teenager .
hot damn , we got ta find those boys ! sign 'em to a big fat contract ! hell 's bells , mr. lunn , if we do n't the goddamn competition will !
oh mercy , yes . you got ta beat that competition .
your job ? you 've got five thousand bucks . what do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for ?
to look at the dirty magazines . i can see all the naked women i want , and it does n't cost me a cent .
in the end , the jury saw it my way .
well , then it all seems to be working out for you . listen , ms ... ?
war games ? thailand ? that 's not true ! how can you believe that ? ca n't you see what they 're doing ? it 's all a lie . we were in da nang , for god 's sake . you 've got to believe me .
i do n't have to do any such thing . i 'm eating my lunch , okay ?
he 's a friend . from the neighborhood . we were just talking .
from the neighborhood ? shut the fuck up . you like telephones ? huh ? you wanta go for a ride ?
he said - `` i can smell your cunt . ''
i see . i myself can not . you use evyan skin cream , and sometimes you wear l'air du temps , but not today . you brought your best bag , though , did n't you ?
i just wanted ... i do n't know ... after all that ... i just wanted one person , one person , to come up to me and say `` you did good , john . '' and mean it . that 's all . after all that .
you just picked that wrong war to be a hero in .
how much is your soul worth if you do n't ?
but it 's my own brother they 're askin ' me to finger and johnny friendly . his mother and my mother was first cousins . when i was this high he took me to the ball games ... .
you 're gon na be okay , toby ... you are ... we 'll getcha fixed up ...
no ... no ... no ... tell me what 's gon na happen ? kip ? tell me . what 's gon na happen ?
here 's my theory . twombley , unaware of illegal union loans or whatever , starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son-in-law is involved .
so mel gordon would n't want a professional hit . that 'd make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .
you take that plate inside the tent an ' you eat it .
would n't be no use . i 'd still see 'em inside the tent .
this one came back and was never seen again . i understand friedman looked after him .
huh , i doubt it ... friedman only deals directly with select customers . i handle the rabble ...
i see . i 'm sorry about this , george . i 'm not happy about this situation . it 's bad . you now know who your brutus is .
you know why i 'm here . you know what i have to do . i came here for permission . out of respect , pablo . this is bullshit , he 's making me look like a punk .
there was n't any draft . that window was closed .
we 're all tired . everybody makes mistakes . tomorrow in the daylight , everything 's gon na look different .
and all the time i 've known you , you 've been grumping and groaning . you should quit making waves . go with the flow .
weaver , i 'm an insect , not a liquid .
i saw these bastards in easy rider , but i did n't believe they were real . not like this . not hundreds of them !
they 're actually nice people when you get to know them .
livid is good . so what is it , maggie ? you here on business ? i saw your lamps . they 're terrific .
it 's something i 've always wanted to do .
ohio is cold ground . picked over , ten months ago . our people worked it , so did the locals .
but not from this angle . not thinking he knew her . you 've got to send me !
your mom is the tooth fairy ? that is so cool !
yeah , she must do all the flying around when i 'm asleep . harry dunne .
you 're right , john . you 're absolutely right . everything 's my problem .
i will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you , dennis . i really will not .
i dunno , man . after what happened to johnny gobs - -
look , johnny gobs got ripped and walked off a roof , all right ? no big loss .
but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled ?
yes , and it 's very bad . it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia .
kat , i 'm in paradise . i do n't ever want to leave .
so , we wo n't be going to london ?
the `` other place , '' what is that ... ?
i do n't know ! i do n't know . there 's a lot of things going on here that i do n't understand . truth takes time .
condolences . how you fixed for cabbage this mornin ' ?
oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff . we only work down here for a hobby , j.p .
mel 's doing some business with me . it 's nice to do favors for people you do business with . he was in a hurry . no big deal .
that was before twombley was shot . before he knew .
hey , do n't expect me to save you . because i do n't do that anymore .
do n't worry . i 'm long past saving .
what about in the mean time ? not the in between time ?
you 'll both get an advance and you can stay with me .
you have n't touched did n't touch anything . we 're stopping . we 've stopped .
i must 've touched something . this happens all the time . it must be my fault . machines hate me .
cush , matt -- we have a decision to make .
`` it 's okay to eat fish , 'cause they do n't have any feelings ...
until this week , that young man probably never saw a machine , let alone one that walks and talks ...
and i do not believe i made a very good first impression .
it better not start yet . i 'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch .
you think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true ?
i 've just come back from the hospital . your victim has died .
you try to frighten me , sir , admit so , sir . this is some new form of torture . say it , brother , sir .
jeez , louise , tapped the phone ? you think so ?
oh , come on ! murder one and armed robbery , thelma !
i 'm still a vd man under the skin , rog . you know me . i 'm a down-to-earth kinda guy , right ?
well , at least you still talk the same .
just , i need results . and -- i am short-handed . who else am i gon na give him ?
give him < u > that < /u > pompous son of a bitch .
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting ?
i 've been planning on kissin ' you for a very long time .
calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen . is your wife coming with you ?
no , she 's going home to her family . she 'll join me in a few weeks ...
i know what you 've done to him and he 's never going back to that .
he 's a freak ! that 's how they live . we 're partners , him and i , business partners . you 're willfully deprivin ' me of my livlihood !
i 'm not coming back ! that 's it ! i want to go home !
grace , listen to me . your body is just healing . you have to give the rest of you time as well ...
she 's obviously that . jesus ! which would you rather have , a million dollars or one of sissy 's thumbs full of pennies ?
oh , you ! i 'm not talking about her hands . they 're difficult to ignore , i confess , but i 'm speaking of her whole being . her whole being is extraordinary . the way she talks , for example . she 's so articulate .
oh , i see ... that must be a great burden .
one must take life as it comes -- do you live in lyon , sir ?
what 's the beef ? we 're sitting pretty . we get room and board - we get paid every week - there 's the palm trees and the flying fish -
what are you giving me with the flying fish ? i know why you want to stick around - you 're after sugar .
frank , you look a little peaked . wan na vomit ?
no , i want an answer , is the story done ?
mr. helpmann , what would you say to those critics who maintain that the ministry of information has become too large and unwieldy ... ?
david ... in a free society information is the name of the game . you ca n't win the game if you 're a man short .
do n't you sometimes wonder if it 's worth all this ? i mean what you 're fighting for ?
we might as well question why we breathe . if we stop breathing , we 'll die . if we stop fighting our enemies , the world will die .
i have to say you look terrible . what 's the trouble ?
you 've heard the rumours they 're going to resettle us in the east ?
no navicom . a lot of good you are now , epps .
lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand .
i did n't think he 'd make it past scraps .
let 's just see if he can make it into round two ... .
you 're not saying what i think you 're saying . i ca n't believe you 're even thinking it .
it 's right here . this region ; an-nagaf . i got recon photos . there 're no troops there , no fighting --
might as well take the rest of the day off . you look sort of fucked up . you 've been paid for the day , anyhow , right ?
not exactly . i mean , he never paid me .
and the shape of it all . it was sort of ... shapeless .
really ? i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good .
i 'm worried about andy . his stress level is affecting his work .
is n't tony clifton going on taxi soon ? maybe that 'll chill him out .
what 's the use of saving lives ... when you see what you do with them !
you 're right but there are lots of good things ... beautiful things ...
you know , animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters . given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population .
roach breeding ? sounds better and better . dana ? the boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime . egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge . should we forget about dinner and go with them instead ?
tell him i will see him day after tomorrow .
that 's good . that works . uh , you know , i want to ask you something ... i know it sounds odd ... but ...
lieutenant dunbar ? it would n't be james schuyler dunbar ? from boston ?
yes , it would . do we know each other ?
now , listen ! you never arrived here with this -- reprieve . get it ?
yes , i did , just now . do n't you remember ?
you 're not a stalker or anything , right ?
well , i probably would n't say if i were , but no .
i forgot how cute you look . when you get impossible .
it 's just ... up there ... right in front of walter 's ... y'know , computer . if memory serves .
you 'll want to count the money in privacy . you know , you do n't need ...
uh , i have a plane to catch to cleveland ... can i get my winnings ?
i 'm not shy . i 've been looked at before .
it 's not an ordinary look . it 's the kind of look a man gives when he 's afraid somebody might be watching him .
i tell you , my man . this is the american dream in action ! we 'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end .
indeed . we must do it . what kind of story is this ?
i do not know what you are referring to .
that 's because you have n't been properly ... stimulated yet .
you know something ? ive just seen so much ugliness i dont think id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time . id hoped to have a private word with adonis , but if thats the way you want it .
what are you doing ? you cant . i ...
i did n't do it -- i did n't do it .
of course you did ! twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar ! the s.s. is running around in circles . the gestapo is arresting the wrong people . and von scherbach has caught the fish . most amusing , is n't it ?
we can discuss all this some other time , susan . right now -
i 'll discuss what 's on my mind when i want to . you 're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it .
we 're not much good at goodbyes , helena .
tell me about beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are , how lucky he is to have you ?
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes .
thanks , binky . can you see bromdingna island yet ?
supposed you dropped dead . what about your inventory ?
i ai n't gon na die . not with a hit .
too bad ... you missed an inspiring day , anna .
i know ... my heart is sad ... but my feet are happy . when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata . not bad at all . are you expecting someone ?
you 're sorry ? you 're the reason we 're here !
wait a second ! i am not the reason you 're here ! i was minding my own business , living a perfectly boring life until you came along !
yes , it 's ... nothing wrong with it , i 'm just ...
sick of the sight of it ! well , suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile i 'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and ... want some coffee ? i was just about ...
did you really believe we would give up our advantage ?
`` super-sucker . `` for once , lex luthor was right .
i 'm sorry . i 've had you on your feet for hours .
you 've been on your feet for days . and did n't even finish your salad .
so what about your story . you thought of a title yet ?
how 'bout get shorty ? except that is n't a movie . that 's real life .
why do men and women usually see each other ?
anything else you want to add before i talk to her ?
say , take it easy ! take it easy ! listen , my boy . no use you hanging around here . just buy the tribune tonight and read all about it . you can rewrite it for your last edition .
could n't make the last edition . it 'd take me four hours to translate your story into english .
from what i 've seen , paden does n't care much about money .
he says he does n't care about anything , but he does . there 's just no telling what it 's going to be .
this'11 get you in anywhere . red elevator . thirty-fifth floor .
where did you get these ? who are you ?
i just do n't know what you 're thinking . i do n't understand your choices . you know , the police are looking for you .
i know . i 'm great at what i do , dad . i mean , i 'm really great .
you said he had two days ' start . that he would blend in . disappear !
are you kidding ? -- i made that up ! you know marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum !
you said < u > three < /u > ... ?
< u > did < /u > i ? i think you 're mistaken .
vada , something happened to thomas j last night , he stepped on a beehive .
i told him not to tease those bees . did he get stung ?
can you ... can you spare some cutter , me brothers ? alex rams his stick into the tramp 's stomach . the boys laugh .
oh-hhh ! ! ! go on , do me in you bastard cowards . i do n't want to live anyway , not in a stinking world like this .
ten reasons . maybe fifteen . and also there 's something in it for me .
oh yeah , i figured that . how much ?
my marriage is the worst . all crap . a big pile of shit .
maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while .
'nam oyo ranged kyo . ' you think it 's dumb of course .
not if it works . i 'll meet you at the train ?
after four years and now the question comes up .
could n't handle it then . now i can .
alaska ! what the heck 's wrong with it !
have n't you ever heard of smack ! horse ! junk ! heroin !
somebody said i 'm just another philistine . with reproductions .
that 's insane . you 're ahead of your time .
at present he serves no useful function . dr. soong created us to become active and useful members of society . i do not believe he would have wanted the b-9 to live out his life in his present state .
i ca n't believe the captain went along with a memory download .
neil , how are you gon na do this ?
sssh . that 's what i 'm taking care of . they need a letter of permission .
well baines the music lover , i never would have known . hidden talents george .
i 'll have to get lessons . it would n't be much use without them .
what do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate ?
out ? are you kidding ? i 've got all the fixings here .
i plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .
that 's too bad . i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge .
the fourth moon of yavin . i 've given the coordinates to chewbacca .
i 'd better go see how he 's doing .
karl , what are you doing here ? come in .
i ai n't a-stayin ' . i need to ast you fer a favor .
that is true , is n't it miles ? your pre-nup is the best there is ?
that is correct . not to blow my own horn , but they devote an entire semester to it at harvard law .
he 's harmless . back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley . i think he did too much lds .
lds ? ? are you dyslexic on top of everything else ? come on , lem me give you a lift . i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that 's why i work with whales .
i do n't know . i 'm completely in the dark here . that 's what i get for moving away .
this happened way before we both got married . i ... i ca n't believe it . you think she had sex with him ?
well , i dunno . i mean , when you looked at all the other options ... it just seemed sorta obvious .
obvious ? why do n't you and i have a little talk about the obvious ... outside .
i think i wan na have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking . can we find them ?
here 's the file . cates checks the file .
your roller coaster that is , quote : `` unlike any that has ever come before it . ''
absolutely . no cheap thrills . a genuine journey to the brink of madness .
no , she wants to be there . and there 's mrs. kalinsky .
there 's jenkins ' wife . you do n't see her on no picket line .
i can save you the trouble . you 're nutty as a fruitcake . i love you anyway .
good , then you wo n't mind cold-cocking this guy when i bring him out .
yeah , yeah right -- what the fuck are doing ? what the fuck are you doing in my house ?
do n't yell , honey . please do n't go crazy --
well . there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about .
i 'm doing a piece on skybolt . i hear macmillan 's meeting with him in nassau .
she had a ... a hole in the palm of her hand ! she could have bled to death .
but she did n't ... did she . if anyone had seen what i 'd seen she 'd be public property ... newspapermen , psychiatrists , ridicule . she does n't deserve that .
the day was n't so bad . we all got through it all right .
ai n't over yet . night is part of day ; separate , but equal . night is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark .
valets . what d'ya mean valets . what is he , then , the earl of fucking doncaster ?
< u > valets < /u > . they park cars . he 's having a party .
they 're trying to divide us on this , scully . we ca n't let them .
they have divided us , mulder . they 're splitting us up .
nobody lives forever , boy . who 'd want to ?
that 's a hell of a thing to say . why , rose ?
i had one < u > puff < /u > on a < u > pipe < /u > .
i do n't want excuses , i want that weird-looking stuff called `` cash . ''
lois , why do n't you at least get one of those automatic ones ?
have n't you heard ? there 's an energy crisis . no , this was good enough for my mother --
no way he 's going anywhere . he 's been well sedated .
he does n't have to be awake to be on his feet .
do n't you think you 're taking this a little too far , number one ?
when we went to ancient rome for deanna 's promotion , we threw her to the lions , remember ?
i 'll take three big macs , two chocolate shakes , two orders of fries , and an apple pie .
you want three big macs , two chocolate shakes , two orders of fries , and an apple pie .
no . i have the space . i figured it out . this is what i want to do .
alright . i 'll ask pablo , tell him it 's for you . i do n't think there will be a problem .
listen judge , oakland 's panther international headquarters . we shut the pig 's infiltration down here , they 're gon na think twice about running their games on other chapters .
huey , man who 's gon na straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass ?
... two things andy is not . uh , but i tell you what .
bein ' that it 's cash , i 'm gon na give you ten percent ...
tot ice skating ? tots ca n't ice skate . liberty bell 's still getting the hang of stairs .
no , but you know bren . she dreams big .
now hold on -- you 're not captain here ... on the battlefield perhaps , but not in the royal bedchamber !
why did you betray me ? paris was ours for the taking ! all i needed was another few hundred men ... why did you take back the army you gave me ?
how did i do this ? ! maybe you did n't notice but i 'm in jail !
all i got ta do is implicate . the feds can do a lot with a good implication . even if you do n't get sparky , i 'll bet you get ten to twenty more . plenty of time to find a nice fella .
as they say -- no good deed goes unpunished .
and all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
you made me have you erased ! i loved you . i love you ! how could you --
i did n't make you . you thought it best . but , look , i take full responsibility .
you were a big favorite in this fight . then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you 're a 12-5 underdog .
i do n't follow no gamblin ' commissioner . i 'm just a fighter .
it 's your job , lady , not mine . i 'm here so he can draw my picture .
i 'm keeping away . what you are doing is no business of mine .
the only other spook i knew was a liar . charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth . he 'd lie about his favorite color . but then i reckon it 's an occupational hazard . all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies .
not revealing information does n't necessarily make someone a liar .
that 's fine , bela . we 're still rolling . just say `` dear , you 're lovely . ''
`` dear , you 're lovely . '' `` strap her to the table . ''
i want lauren . i want my life back . i want ... to know why .
why ? why 's anything happen ? it 's all money , man . money . the girl just got in the way .
i 'll be perfectly honest with you , ma'am . it 's not that i do n't trust you , but ...
but what ? is there anything so terribly wrong about ... making a decision and wanting to hurry ? do you think i 've stolen ... my car ?
i want to see the original pictures of joan gale .
hey , mattie , dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on joan gale .
we 'll begin sedation tonight . starting with him .
you ca n't ! they 'll be defenseless against their dreams .
in the future , will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her ?
no . the pill will change all that . then he would n't have blamed me . we were just too young .
what i like about ian , he believes in a chain of command , but not a chain of respect , you understand what i 'm saying ?
right . chain of respect . that 's good , that .
what you need is an engineer . if you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights , some basic block and tackle mechanism , you could to this a lot more easily .
it 's not supposed to be easy , it 's supposed to be beautiful .
what kind of bar is it if ya ca n't get a martini ? !
it 's a juice and coffee bar , man , like i been tellin ' ya --
more about life on mars . from a rock they < u > found < /u > on the south pole . explain that one to me . but maybe we should go to mars and find out ? how much do you think that 's going to cost ?
what is it with you and the space program ?
you see , son ? i 'm old and i 've lived . when a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him .
ma -- and yet , a man could change that , could n't he ?
i had my license hearing coming up and i did n't wan na leave anything to chance .
that was nineteen years ago , and they were simple gambling pinches .
we 're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer .
not acknowledging harry 's comment you 'll be okay little fish .
yes sir . i need to talk to you .
give me two seconds with lacy here ? go on in , i wo n't be a moment .
but horror stories ! why all the time horror stories ?
shirley , i wrote for years without selling a single word .
you know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him .
there 's no way i was gon na die in that deli ... let 's just say i 've been on a lucky streak lately .
this is terrible , sir - i hope you 're not badly injured ...
no . i 'm not badly injured . but my leg is very sore .
`` you do n't care about anything except you . you just want to persuade people that you
love them so much that they ought to love you back . only you want love on your own terms. ``
you do n't know the power of the dark side . i must obey my master .
i will not turn ... and you 'll be forced to kill me .
that conviction does n't convince me of anything . until i know that i did it , i 'm not going to accept that i did .
you may never remember at all . [ beat ] your mind 's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged .
it 's pretty hard to stay away from that word is n't is ?
you could see all the things he did , could n't you ?
'course you 'll wan na fuck her in the ass . pussy just wo n't feed right anymore -
that is , of course , if you do n't catch aids from all your anal intrusions .
we do n't use the b-word . bad luck .
so you 're the `` device squad '' ... and you defuse `` devices '' ?
you do what you want with your own scalp . do not be tellin ' us what to do with ours .
you , sir ! you call yourself a loyal subject ?
here 's my passport ... . please give me a visa . i have to leave for russia immediately .
count leon d'algout ... a count ! ... a nobleman !
tonight ! right now ! we steal a man from a royal prison , we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide , and still you wish to tell me nothing ? !
you seek facts , when it would be better to seek truth .
whatever we do - we fuck her , right ?
oleg , get in bathroom , stay there and shut up !
you 're going to be late if you do n't hurry up and change soon .
change ? what 's wrong with what i got on ?
fuck the profile ! that 's the same guy ! !
she ca n't be here because of a ... a soap opera . not a soap opera . that 'd make her ...
ganz is in jail . he 's gon na be there two years after i 'm on the street .
did n't work out that way . he busted out with a big indian . they capped two guards on a road gang . nice meeting you reggie .
you 've said a lot of things about the president in the last few months .
they 're true ! everything i said ! witholding that veto was treason !
fine -- they 're fine . oh , miss paine , i -- i want to apologize -- what the papers said i said about you -- that was n't true . i -- i would never say a thing like that .
did you hear , father ? he did n't mean it when he said i was beautiful .
i do n't believe this . it 's a miracle , michael . a miracle .
better living through chemistry , that 's my motto .
you have n't mentioned dating anyone since mark and , well you 're not a lesbian are you ?
no , i 'm not a lesbian . geez mom .
it 's just for a little while , sam . the baby-sitter was n't there .
i ought to fuckin ' have you committed . you fuckin ' do that again , i 'll f- , i 'll f-

hey terry , what is that ? did peggy make it up ? i 've never seen that on bandstand .
what if we 're witnessing the end of touch dancing ?
you do n't know if he was really gon na --
yes i do ! it never woulda stopped , you know that . jesse 's always gon na be making mistakes and we 'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives .
what is it you want ? respect ? i have respect for you , just for making this call . one philosopher said `` sadness is a sin against the richness of the world . '' think about it . feel it .
you do n't even know me . i want real respect .
you 're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman 's body in the morgue ?
the bone was porous , as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it .
oh , i 'm afraid i could n't get away , sam .
still got the nose to the old grindstone , eh ? jane , i offered to let george in on the ground floor in plastics , and he turned me down cold .
you ? why ? since when have you become the protector of little children ?
i 'm not concerned about the child , toddy . it 's you i 'm thinking of , i 'd like to see you prove that a lot of things i know have n't hurt toddy macfarlane any .
ah , everybody screws up some , brian . you 're working for the toughest lt. on the job . saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building . it 's just bad luck you 're family .

sir , i just want you to know ... i 'm not here to make a statement . i do n't want to make men look foolish . all i care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else , i suspect .
if you were like everyone else , lieutenant , i suspect we would n't be making statements about not making statements , would we ? take your leave .
besides , why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder ?
excuse me , sheriff . as we explained to your associate here , there 's been a mistake . we did n't kill anybody . now , as for the bootlegging , we happen to work for a very important man in new york .
i think so , but i ca n't get close enough . there 's a lot of blood . i 'll try to find out more .
find out anything you can ... you got a grand coming .
-- and how you happen to be living here .
it 's a place to live , that 's all .
my brother and nephew perished two days ago , when their hay cart turned over .

the people came to see a motion < u > picture < /u > . ... hold on ...
good question . he may not have intended to . the girl in question is lady 3jane . she 's very important to us . the third clone of lady jane tessier .
the old man cheats on his wife with her own clone ?
well , say , how 'bout easin ' it down a bit so a man do n't have to shout !
mister mcmurphy , there are old men here who could n't hear the music at all if it were lower . that music is all they have , and i wish you would n't lean against the glass there , your hands are staining the window .

gwen ... gwen , c'mon , wait , no !
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit .
you think it 's me ? you think i 'm saying there was a conversation when there was n't ?
mitch , if they hear the car starting ... if they see movement ...
we 'll take it slow until we get to the main road . are you ready ?

too old , dull fighter . bobby judge is a good boy .
... i do n't feel heat from the name .
mafiosos getting caught with kilos and walkin ' on bail the same day .
little girls catchin ' stray bullets in their heads , playin ' hopscotch in their front yards . and everyone thinks the same thing ... someone should just go kill those motherfuckers .
unfortunately not , sir . a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows . not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers , the redoubtable mr. alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident .
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers .

isolated pockets of humanoids . it appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development .

well ... he did n't have to tell me that part .
i 'm sure you 've seen this . perhaps you knew this man under another name ?
no , i never saw him before in my life .
all we 've got to do is make it to the top .
and find the treasure , and get it , and get back to the humvee , and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off , but that 's about it .
come on , carter . you know it 's michael .
what do you want me to do , put out an a.p.b . on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone ?
guess you can tell from my reaction , i 'm not all that used to visitors out here . what can i do for you ?
i was just wondering if you happen to know anything about paul sheldon .
they 're going to kill me next . that 's what i hear . these new indians are destroying everything . our people are a quiet people .
they can lead us to jimmy . just let them go . we 're tightening the net on him . we know he 's on the reservation .
no , see , i do n't need a finder 's fee , i need - finder 's fee 's , what , ten percent , heck that 's not gon na do it for me . i need the principal .
jerry , we 're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars .

well , i do n't know what you gon na do about it , because i do n't hear no riot an ' i do n't see no riot , an ' what 's more i do n't believe they *is* no riot . look for yourself .
look , i dont know whats going on here but i am senior vice president of this company .
i dont care who you are . its christmas and like i told you the building is closed .
-- i have the feeling that , all in all , what i made this voyage for -- has served its purpose .
what are you saying , that it 's time to go ?
i do n't know who else to turn to , auggie .
you 've suckered me before , darling , remember ? why should i believe you now ?
a hundred and eighty fathoms ! we ca n't be sinking that fast ... .
it 's the screws , skipper . at our declination angle , running in reverse , they 're pulling the shark < u > and < /u > cyclops right to the bottom .
you know what gets me ? those guys who went to the moon ! to the moon , boy !
leave me alone ! after eight years of horrendously close association , the time has come to part ! i crave solitude and time for reflection -- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood . you and i may not meet again for months !
i did n't say what time the assault occurred .
you said last night . i went to bed pretty early .
i do n't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy ...
i 'm going to sleep it off . let me know if there 's some other way we can screw up tonight .
i do n't know . that 's why i came to see mrs. redi . i 'm trying to find her .
you mean miss jacqueline 's gone , and you do n't know where she is ?
come on , come on , you 're a toughie . you can take this . do n't cry .
i 'm not as tough as you think i am .
look , tran ... lenny just came by to give me some bad news . an old friend of mine has been murdered . you remember iris ?
a tragic story , no doubt . how 'd you get up here ?
you ai n't talking to no one , till you calm down .
i am calm .. < u > i am calm < /u > ..
but what happens if instead of this ... ultimate warrior ... it is evil who stands here ?
white turns to black . light to dark . life to death . for all eternity .
look , i do n't know where mr. strader might be . he comes and he goes .
the girl out front mentioned strader 's assistant , somebody named watson . maybe he knows .
lord chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my basutos .
i think chelmsford wants a good man on the border why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady commander in reserve .
look . it 's hobbes ! he 's all right .
come on . let 's get back to the others . we ca n't leave them alone .
we swam . the atlantic , it 's not that big really .
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport .
we 're sorry , ma'am . we got a little carried away .
well , i do n't know if sorry can make up for it . i found your remarks highly offensive .
i do n't have time to go upstairs . the police are looking for me . i need to know where it is and exactly what it is .
i get it ! this is your old plan , right ?
i just want to sit here longer , i mean the feeling is powerful -- why 's that ?
maybe the best part of your life is over and you do n't want to get up and start the bad part .
i do n't think so . i 'm busy thursday night .
you think i enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients ? i 'm making an exception because i respect you as an artist and as a dresser .
ripped off . by hand , my guess . perimortal : victim was alive at the time , there 's blood on his throat .
that 's the thing . do n't know if it connects , but harold here had a thing about eyes . two of the victims had their eyes gouged out , another punctured . took polaroids after .
yeah , i remember the girl who was in it with me . she was something .
i just remember you jogging . so when 's the wedding ?
sump'n got to happen soon . we got one day 's more grease , two day 's flour , an ' ten potatoes . after that ... an ' rosasharn , we got to remember she 's gon na be due soon .
it sure is hell jus ' tryin ' to get enough to eat .
we move to sunny l.a. all of show business is out there , max .
no , i can not . you keep bringing it up , but i do n't wan na live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light .
yeah , well times probably would make you seem crazy .
or just plain stupid . you 'd think by the twentieth time , i 'd have found an alternative method . maybe a more effective one , if you know what i mean .
the moment you returned from the battle your options were clear . if you are a friend to neither side , legate , you must be an enemy to both . we needed to know what you believed .
i hope you live to see what i believe ...
they dig for the gems to support our cause . they also search for the last two stones . soon we will have all five sankara stones and the thuggees will be all powerful !
nobody can say you do n't have a vivid imagination .
no , no ! i 'll stay and help you find your friend .
i 'm not looking for a friend . i 'm looking for a jedi master .
why do n't i make you some of this new mococoa drink ? all natural . cocoa beans from the upper slopes of mount nicaragua . no artificial sweeteners --
-- what the hell are you talking about ? !
do you care to tell me what mrs. white-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house ?
i 'm just taking the poor girl under my wing .
you wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together , would you ?
you will have to ask mr de moraes that , sir . would you like a drink while you wait ?
it 's war . people get lost all the time in war , cut off --
we disappear for awhile . we disappear , we came back ; nobody knows nothing .
and there will come < u > another < /u > moment . when the stakes are < u > really < /u > there . and she will look back on this . and remember how good it felt . how easy it was .
and she 'll fight back again . god help me , what have i done .
did something terrible happen to you when you were a child ? something so bad ... ?
ohhhh , that one ! can we hear that one ?
as i said , he is n't italian . besides , i thought they just killed them .
do n't be naive . they ca n't kill everybody . they have different punishments for different things . like , if they kill a stool pigeon , they leave a canary on the body . it 's symbolic .
they ca n't be serious . the ship 's in pieces and we 've less than a skeleton aboard .
starfleet , are you aware of our currant status ?
i 'm not asking you to swear to anything .
i do n't want you to wait for me .
we need to give you a physical , so we know what got zapped .
well why did n't you say so ? you want me to lift some weights or something ?
soon as i rest a bit . i meant as soon as we are back to normal again , anytime .
here i am thinking about myself when poor harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen .
this ring belonged to my sister . i 'd love for you to ...
it would be honor , brock . now let 's go get this guy ...
he was working on something called project manticore , which was using recombinant dna to produce a superior human ... a warrior ... an advanced infantry soldier .
not that i do n't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me ?
if you behave , maybe next time daddy 'll let you drive .
keep talking , there wo n't < u > be < /u > a next time .
he is not going to kill the old man ?
no , hanna . my heart is n't that black .
like gangbusters , doc . okay , i missed the last one .
you missed the last three , including her birthday . your wife 's gripe sheet .
it 's michael . how are you , mom ?
i 'm alright . will you stay home for awhile ?
oh , yeah , just sitting there eatin ' a salad , you know . that kind of thing happens all the time in l.a. it 's , you know ... i met johnny depp .
you did ? i love him . yeah , you know , i 'm thinking of moving to new york .
it 's a nightclub , not a drive-in , hal . i do n't follow the customers to the parking lot .
alright , lena . go on home . we might have to call you in for some more questioning .
congratulations . unfortunately , my train is about to leave , and i really must insist you disembark .
your train ? listen , friend , you 're obviously lost . ... i 've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime .
but what am i telling the press about kent state ?
tell 'em what you like ; they 'll never understand it anyway .
what 's the use , there ai n't none .
mmm . would you get me another half a-cup of coffee , dear ?
some guys from ninth avenue jumped fanucci today ; slit his throat from ear to ear .
no , i did n't know . is he dead ?
you fuckin ' guys . you ruined me . i 'm fuckin ' done . permanent package boy .
who says that ? you could take credit on it .
brewer ! you know what that thing 's packing ?
it 's a soviet mil mi-24 . probably has 12.7mm nose cannon , heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles , plus ...
< u > charlie < /u > < u > maccorry < /u > ! ... you were n't fixin ' to marry him ? ?
she sure is ! ... an ' do n't think your comin ' back is goin ' to change it !
would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with ?
i do n't know . maybe he does n't know , either .
no one-seventeen , they 'll fuck it up ! he told me not to tell anybody , to bring claire and come alone ! he wo n't wait , he knows i 'm two minutes away ! koontz , please !
i ca n't do it , you know that ... he 's not gon na allow it anyway , mike . no way is he gon na let anybody walk out of that house alive , who can finger him .
here we are . rembrandt 's drawings . edward hopper . van gogh 's letters .
pick two or three . now that the coffers are open , you might as well take advantage of me .
yes ... i know about them . the code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault .
you want ... money ? what kind of terrorists are you ?
and one bullet . that 's all it 's gon na take .
but vince has contacts all over the place ! this is san francisco ! they 'll be looking for me !
her name is pamela isley . i saw her talking to gordon . she must have stolen his keys , altered the signal-
and she did it all for me . for love .
it 's unbelievably trans-plendid ! i was at the stones concert in altamount when they killed that guy , remember ?
yeah , were yuh ? i was-i was at an alice cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes .
yesterday that might 've meant something . pull me off . you 'd be doing me a big favor .
yesterday yes , today no . what happened last night ?
wow . hey , you look good . like you , you know , head 's in a good place , you know ? you , are still doing your painting ?
sometimes , yeah . you know , i started to do performances .
ray -- ray -- how do you feel , man ?
groovy . i 've never felt better in my life .
but these are white people , anybody . the punch ...
i do n't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell . this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at .
i see . you 're afraid of going to jail , eh ?
well , no . you see , i got this plumbing business
the first couple , yes , but after that it became increasingly difficult .
mrs. kramer , did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband ?
yeah , well i figure these are unusual circumstances .
that 's what i was hoping you 'd say .
i know you did n't but you have been so thoughtful .
but when your sunflowers come up , i 'll pay you for them .
i hope you do n't think it 's me . i do n't even balance my checkbook on downtime . i 've got a honeywell at home for that .
no , no , i 'm sure , but -- you understand . it should only be a couple of days . what 's the thing you 're working on ?
we need to give you a physical , so we know what got zapped .
well why did n't you say so ? you want me to lift some weights or something ?
so she picks the women , we pick the programs . seals ?
i 'd go special reconnaissance . every bit as tough -- and we have a percent drop-out rate among the men .
i 'm afraid . i 'm afraid if paulie finds out .
do n't worry about paulie . is he helping you ? is he putting food on the table ? we 've got to help ourselves . we just have to be careful while we do it .
boy , for four or five days there i did n't think i 'd live . but i 'm my old self again !
umm . well . yes . but no more strange voices in the night , rose .
that 's why you 're here . to get in the middle of something ?
maybe . i 've always < u > read < /u > about what 's happened . i 've never ... i know it sounds silly but , it 's nice to be someplace < u > while < /u > something is actually ... y'know ... happening .
four . wow . what a big boy . i love you , sean .
i love you , too ! i love you daddy . love ya , dad .
iris , stop ! it 's not his fault . the communal wine just proves too temptin ' for some of them .
that 's why we lutherans use grape koolaid for the blood of christ .
the whole town 's in a state , kiki doors locked , people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
you mean you 're not coming back to work here ?
that 's the first time you 've been right today . that 's what i --
you do n't know how good it is to see you .
maybe you wo n't feel that way after i tell you what i stopped in for .
i did n't think i was being defensive . i was just ...
he should have been in restraints . it was bad judgment on your part , plain and simple . why not just cop to it ?
well , more power to you . me , i start to bug out after too much time out here .
i do n't have a problem with it . besides , you get to meet a lot of interesting people .
i think i 'm gon na be sitting up with her .
i 'd do the same . well , catch you thursday .
what about mitch ? did n't he have anything to say about this ?
i can understand his position . he went through a lot with lydia after his father died . he did n't want to risk going through it all over again .
and i 'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman , brian .
uh , i think there 's been a mistake . i did n't save that woman .
i know a lot of men who did n't do anything till they met walter burns . please , dear .
all right . one -- two -- three -- four -- five . five hundred . be careful , honey .
that 's just perfect is n't it ? did it work ? did you find out why i came back ?
i think it has something to do with your birthday . you were rambling . i did n't understand the rest .
what the hell you thinking , girl ? strolling in here this late ?
do n't talk to me , mr. sawyer . do n't say nothing to me this morning .
i do n't want them hurt . any of 'em ...
`` do n't want '' the dodgers to lose or the summer to end . but we do n't get to choose these things ...
look , i 'm sorry . i know you said not to talk , but when i saw the crowd i just got excited ...
we 're not upset with you , dave . we think you did a terrific job . do n't we ?
but they do n't know about the translation ! they could be in danger right now .
we ca n't spare the personnel . we 've got minimum takeoff capability right now . that 's why chaz left us on board .
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?
she hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste .
aphrodite baggot who does it behind the dog and trumpet ?
henslowe , you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate ?
no , do n't open the door . we do n't want it escaping .
well , what the hell good can we do in here ? we ca n't grab it -- it might jump on us --
i do n't see you coming up with any plans .
my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now . that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us , but we ca n't seem to do nothing for ourselves . do n't you feel a little disgusted right now ?
i do n't know ... this thing has got my goat . i 've got to find out .
nick - i wo n't have you going down there .
please , do n't you realize ? she is dying .
well , not < u > dying < /u > , actually . i 'm changing . you know , like from winter to spring . of course , it is a big step to take .
only about three months . eh we 're from vermont . my husband was teaching school there .
did the appearance of danny 's imaginary friend ... ?
is this , me and you , like a lawyer- client relationship ? the lawyer ca n't tell nothing he hears ?
you 're not my client until you get busted and i bond you out .
the dog 's an albino . he 'd love an animal like that .
gentlemen , i believe an albino dog is rare indeed .
we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers . it 's the only way to ensure that their smut ca n't reach american soil !
oh , uh ... i do n't know if air strikes are necessary .
hum , babe , hum , babe , fire it in here , hum babe --
that 's not necessary , jackson -- - okay , nuke , now lean in for the sign .
these guys that got me down here , you know , huh ... they think that i 'm part of this whole thing . they think i 'm part of the plot to rob the bank !
how did they think that ? what are they ... crazy ? what do you mean . that 's bullshit , leon . they 're giving you a fucken story .
now listen . now that you 're on your way , it would be stupid of you to stop . think of sebastian as a tutor . let him instruct you .
i do n't love him . i love ronald .
james , like it or not , they 're your parents .
parents ? they 're not my parents . they 're my grandparents . my parents are dead .
you give him credit for too much cleverness . my impression was that he 's just another blundering american .
but we must n't underestimate american blundering . i was with them when they `` blundered '' into berlin in .
definitely . colson had him trying to break into bremer 's apartment after bremer shot wallace , to plant mcgovern campaign literature .
i had nothing to do with that . was he ... in the ellsberg thing ?
i suppose castro staged the whole thing just to beat you .
buddy , before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again , you should remember : people vote not out of love , but fear . they do n't teach that at sunday school or at the whittier community playhouse !
i told you , i do n't know where sidney is . and even if there was a third killer , sidney does n't know about it .
that is for me to decide . i need to talk to her mr. riley , she is a key element in this case . i have a press conference in an hour , and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities .
oh , that 's right . that you really like those new york girls .
well , no ... not just , not only .
your friends would . your dad would kill me with a machete .
we 're japanese , not mexican , ishmael . he 'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword .
we 're not gon na do that now . we 're not gon na do that now and that 's over .
bullshit . bullshit , dad we need to get his money and go .
they should go one truck at a time . when the first truck gets through to the airport , then the others will follow .
we ca n't wait . we all go together or not at all .
right , the one simone gives me . simone and i 'll make the switch at robinson's/may . she knows what i look like ?
she saw you with sheronda . so simone goes to the dress department with her robinson's/may bag .
i knew you 'd come . and i knew i 'd have to come up here and talk to you . i could n't let you go back without any word . i came to tell you again -- jessica can not be cured .
but how did you get here ? what are you doing here ?
i would n't mind a little night life . how about you ?
hard to tell what 's shakin ' in a place like this , honey . you do n't want to be walkin ' in the wrong door .
yeah , i reckon they did . hit like to tore me up when i read about that pore little cripple boy .
yeah , me too . that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers .
edvard said the same thing about you before he died .
i 'm shocked , shocked to think that you 'd believe him .
you 're right , mr. mannheim , but you got ta get to the big time first , then you can be a pillar and do good things .
ca n't get a little bit pregnant , bud .
oh ... indeed . crealock , we should see that colonel dumford has an officer for his hard riders . perhaps a subaltern from the twenty fourth .
i thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks zulu .
did he just say what i think he said ?
i 've got a clue . look at my ring . before my old lady ran off to baja , she told me my dad had this same ring .
after you have frozen , your icy tomb will plummet back to gotham .
freeze , you 're mad . this capsule will slaughter thousands .
why , because i 'm a freak and you are beautiful , and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak , nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles ?
you 're fucked up , lila . why do n't you fucking try electrolysis or something ? figure it out for chrissake .
uh oh , it 's nancy . she wants another load of firewood .
forget it , man . it 's not worth it .
do n't know how long it 's take to get a charge ...
keep it tonight . we 'll catch fish . i 'll see ya back on the docks ...
no one wants another failure right now , god knows . but people like arnold and , god knows , i 'm having my fears about general washington .
finally ! ? it 's people like these who , as soon as they get a little power , want more and more . more ale , here !
yes ... you woke me up ... its the middle of the night here . have you found mr friedman ?
not yet . the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address . ill give it hours . he just might show up . if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont . paul lamont , all right ?
i spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago , but she has n't heard from him either . it 's beginning to get a little scary .
that could be a good sign , though . it could mean that he got away .
what 's this : `` i 'm declining this case ? '' it do n't work that way .
this ca n't be my last duty here . it will go on and on .
our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders . and therefore , to disregard anything that does n't come on the crm-114 .
but the crm-114 has been smashed for almost an hour .
would n't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives ?
you think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes , peanut . ai n't we been doin ' a pretty fair job this far ?
we got someone watching her hours a day . she --
that 's not what i mean . i want to see her .
yeah . i 'm going home today . what do you want , frankie ?
i do n't want anything . i just wanted to say ... that i may have ... overreacted a little the other day .
here 's the plan : we 'll get a ... a flatbed , i guess , with a big winch , figure a five ton anyway .
naw , do n't want to winch it . that 'd tear it all up . want to lift it . some kind of crane with lifting straps .
weird , comes into alleys and does n't bowl .
it 's not an `` alley '' . i hate when people call it a `` bowling alley '' , it 's so common ! i prefer `` bowling center '' .
you got that right . i thought you wanted to kill vampires .
i do n't want to kill anybody , and i do n't want to talk about it anymore .
-- forget it . and try not to bleed on my throw rugs . why do this ?
if you have to ask , you would n't understand .
of course not . how ... how could it be ? nothing happened .
if i was going to charge you , i would have told you beforehand . i thought i explained that .
you have n't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating ...
well , you 've done so much ... what 's new ?
time 's up ... we 'll have to take them out immediately .
it means killing benes ... and for all we know , they may have completed the operation ! damn it to hell !
yeah . and under other abnormal circumstances , i think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones .
better put it on hold 'til we find pritchett .
i made it outside . i 'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here . help is on the way . just sit tight .
it 's a little late , you son of a bitch . there 's a friggin ' monster loose in here ! get the fbi , the fire department . find metal cutters , cut through . and bring a cannon . the damn thing is huge .
what do you mean no ? they can fly us home .
they 'll ask questions ; want to know why we were out here .
you mean about the cubans getting trained north of the lake ?
oh , you got that ? banister 's pet project . getting paid by the government to work against the government . beautiful . what a mind he had , what a guy , guy . he had all those files .
because i 'm working the night shift - and i got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there 's a lull -
are n't you a little too young for that , sonny ?
bobby -- who 's the greatest man in america today ?
gee -- i do n't know ... the space man , i guess .
what d'you know about how joanna felt ? you went off to an office every morning and you 'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell .
did it ever occur to you guys that joanna kramer 's not the easiest person in the world to live with ? ! did it ? ! for one thing she 's always thirty minutes late . you can set your watch by it --
what game , cobb ? ... i 'm on my way to nirvana ...
you 're on your way somewhere all right ... the looney bin .
anyway , i 'm too tired to worry about the creep . could n't get back to sleep at all . so what you dream ?
forget it , the point is , everybody has nightmares once in a while . no biggy .
i 'll give you a hint . if you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a jaguar ...
honey , i 'm really sorry , i was gon na call you about tonight . larry 's got a lodge meeting . there 's no way i can get a sitter this fast .
look what they did to my hand , man !
all right , i 'm gon na give you a choice . you can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here . you ca n't have both . what do you want ?
perhaps it wasnt so brave of him . had i been here i just might have given him his money , mr lombard . one can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct , as someone in your line of work ought to know .
was it cash , mr de moraes ? the ł1,000 . you gave it to him in cash ?
roger , arctic warrior . i say again , our records indicate the passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea . over .
roger , north island . please advise pending further information . over .
lad , i 'm a busy man . july 's always a big month for murder . fella named barone turned up just this mornin ' , throat cut ear to ear . black hand .
when you 're investigatin ' , how long ya keep at it ?
they 're makin ' a movie , here , goddamn it .
all right , they 're makin ' a movie .
aww , naw , amy , that wo n't be necessary . i should n't send it ; she 's just doing her job , i guess .
well , i do n't know ; maybe she does deserve it . maybe she should 've come in to face you man to man .
i 'm a gambler -- i 'm running at large like a happy pig , devouring anything of life that pleases me , i really belong in jail
oh ! what a picture -- and what else ?
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we 're going .
oh , i thought you might have a date i do n't know why i 'm bothering to ask , but are you going to bogey lowenstein 's party saturday night ?
does this attack on our plane represent a definitive , intentional escalation on the part of the soviets ?
the soviets are in control of the sams . it 's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch .
because you 're going to help me plan a party .
you 're going to < u > do < /u > that ?
-- and now i got reporters from toadsquat , iowa , calling my office and askin ' what i know about this `` g.i . jane '' thing .
-- nothing i can do about it unless you 're suggesting i infringe on their civil liberties -- which i 'd happily do if you 'll just trim a little fat off the constitution .
of all the people who have been born ... and have died ... while the trees went on living .
their true name is sequoia sempervirens : always green , ever- living .
he is ... you sat in that coffee shop across from school --
watching my son ... ted , i 've been living in new york for the past two months .
that 's almost interesting , mark . who did you dance with ?
her name was cynthia vogel and she was a good dance partner . even let me put my hands on her butt .
i would n't point no pistol at nobody , sir .
a wise policy . but if you did , i can assure you , the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand ... in awe . whereas , a president ... i mean , why not shoot a president ?
i 'm sorry about your financial problems . i really am . but they are your problems .
you 're right , john . you 're absolutely right . everything 's my problem .
we 've done that . he 's a san francisco private eye . name martin j. goble , g-o-b-l-e. had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it . goble and greer is the firm name .
swimming with his hat on ? that 's original .
wait , crash -- do n't go -- all i want is a date . i 'm not gon na fall in love with you or nothin ' .
i 'm not interested in a woman who 's interested in that boy .
if the headline is big enough , it makes the new big enough . the murder of mrs. harry silverstone -
as a matter of fact , we sent a man to the silverstone home yesterday afternoon . our man even arrived before the `` chronicle '' reporter . and there 's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she 's dead .
no , it 's not . now i get to pitch .
michael , you should n't be happy when someone else is n't feeling well .
< u > then how 's it gon na get in the < /u > < u > picture < /u > ? !
i know a guy in universal 's stock house -- he 's giving me the footage for free . this movie 's gon na look like a million bucks .
rosemary , honey . good morning . i 'm fine . thanks for remembering .
it 's the least i could do . i heard shouting .

that word again ! i do n't even know what it means ...
uh , oh ... i see where this is going ...
... all of you owe time and i thought tonight would be a good time to -- -
frederick , just what is it that you are saying ?

i still do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .
no , i do n't < u > think < /u > so ...
it is < u > you < /u > who have betrayed ...
with two or three days ' practice , you 'll be able to use it as well as i can . then we 'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here .
two or three days ! while lyssa is in their hands ?
you think that could possibly be a full time job ? how many hair colors could there be ?
someone 's got that job . agent orange ! i came up with that one . anyway , there are endless color possibilities and i 'd be great at it .
the one on the other side is letting men in .
then that 's our play . but we 're still going to need some insurance . come on .

well , i do n't have hallucinations . honest .
this doctor , was he tall , with dark hair ?
is that because you were masquerading as luke trumbo while you were in lawson ?
mr. clyde you 're twisting things around . i was n't masquerading . luke trumbo ... luke was a good man who gave his life for his country . i just ... happen to look a little bit like him . that 's all .
yeah , well , it just pains me somethin ' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water ...
yes ... we were discussing mister harding 's problem with his wife . now , who will start ? billy .
ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?

you know about sanctuary ! i know you do ! you have to help us ! you do n't have a choice ! it is n't your decision ! ! tell us .

the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people 's lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again .

surprise -- is the most important element of attack . and beside , you 're not up on your private eye literature . when they 're in trouble , it 's always their girl friday who gets them out of it .
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls , and over-passionate daughters of the rich .
are you all right , marty ? you seem a little ... nervous .
oh , no , i 'm fine ... fine .
you must get away . before i cut . i 'm not cutting if you 're here . he 's struggling . he 's going to topple over if he cuts .

'cause i 'm up to my ass in shit is why . i 'm broke , plus i got legal problems ... nobody was asking for me , huh ?
truman , i 've watched you your whole life . i saw you take your first step , your first word , your first kiss . i know you better than you know yourself . you 're not going to walk out that door --
-- you never had a camera in my head .
and that is how you talk to a girl , rat . voila . you ca n't miss .
i think i 've got it . once i get going , i 'll be okay . but ... how do i get started ? i mean , i hardly know her .

what are you saying ? i 'm standing here as real as you .
you can not be real , conor . you had the last rites . no man has been cut half as bad and lived .

no one has seen a shark -- no fin , no bites , nothing . be realistic .
we can see each other , we can even have dinner ... but respectably , in my house with my mother 's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three !

and i was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption .
perhaps the machine 's on the blink ! it keeps picking up old films . that ca n't he right , can it ?

what the hell would i do with that grease pit ? besides , nadine 's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head . then all this abilene shit happened . you heard about that bank robbery in abilene , did n't ya ?
grab the coffee , will ya ? i told zed i 'd give him a buzz .
listen -- do me a favor -- do n't mention the thing --
she let it escape because she wants me to die .

well , i guess i woulda at least pulled my pistol an ...
shit , kid , you pulled your pistol ... right outta the lady an ' out the back window .
do you remember the night i fell into that cave and the bat chased me ?
your parents ' wake . rain fell like tears .
yeah , it 's just the same thing over and over again .
uh ... we ca n't leave washington 'till we find that chick .
medusa ... what 's this ? some kind of club ?
it 's nothing . a stupid party . not really a night club , it 's , uh ...
that was n't an offer . a million would 've been an offer . when they send the god damn mail clerk down to jerk me off , waste my time , it 's a fuck you .
i do n't get why they 'd do that .
it 's hopeless -- i do n't even know what we 're looking for .
it 's all right -- i do n't think tex does , either .
please revel with me , aramis , i need my spirits lifted . i 'm old , i 'm weak , my strength is gone --
be quiet , you fat fool . ca n't you see i 'm praying ?
well , what am i supposed to say ? `` i ca n't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere '' ? !
there 's something wrong with every single place we look at ! why do n't you just come right out and tell me you do n't want to move in with me ? !
hands ! come about ! jackets off the cannons ! we are to fire on our own ship ?
better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate .
one thousand ? ? that 's an awful lot of oranges . you know there are pill , lois . i 've seen them .
oh sure . the american answer to everything . pills . no , this is -- -- natural .
well , rose , going out to look for a job today ?
what 's the use , there ai n't none .
sir . yes . when a thing is wrong ... as in this case , i am available . i am seventy-four years old , i am not board-certified . i have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and i know when an injustice has been done .
do you , indeed . i 'll bet you do . fine . fine . we 'll save the court the time . we will admit the doctor as an `expert witness , ' fine .
in other words , our scope is too narrow .
at our press conference tomorrow , i think we should announce our plans to explore the world . not just a few leggy 36d 's , with blond hair upstairs and down .
and what about the ones you do n't save ?
you live with it ... and they haunt you . it does n't leave .
hey ! do n't let them shoot those girls . this is too much . they got guns pointed at 'em !
the women are armed , hal . this is standard . now you stay calm here . these boys know what they 're doin ' .
but you do n't keep a cat , do you ?
we do n't even like them , i 've often thought of giving it away , but oliver would n't stand for it . it was his first wife 's favorite picture . she was an artist .
next point . friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged . relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden .
we had the same rule at sun city , but it was impossible to check .
how many men are working with you on this ?
less than you would guess . most days two to three assistant d.a. 's . a handful of police investigators .
but then you do n't get to watch the ball games . you told me you were a mets fan .
i listen on the radio . i can see the games just fine that way . the world is in your head , remember ?
... i 'm thrilled . as you know , uh ... uh , on my agent 's advice i sold out , and i 'm gon na do an appearance on tv .
no , no , no that 's not it at all . alvy 's giving an award on television . gee , he talks like he 's violating a moral issue sitting here .
ok ... because of the time difference if you needed to call me early ?
it 's fine . i can just get you at your office .
i refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship .
but what about the drowning boy i 've been seeing ?
harry only has two moods : busy ... * and asleep .
then you better do something to * jumpstart that man 's motor . you know ... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion .
well , it 's one way to get her down stairs .
okay . and let 's have the car right outside .
i 'm required by state law to inform you that , while it 's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items , it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of ...
yeah , i know the spiel . if you could bag it , i 'll be on my way , thank you .
maybe i should talk about this with ruth , or paul .
we all agree with the doctor , dear . he thinks it 's safer for you to stay here for a while .
listen ... nicky ... we talked about this ... and , uh , i explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss .
yeah . i think i want my money back .
you know , buddy , about this friendship thing ...
yeah , it 's great , is n't it . i think it 's so cool ... have a girl as a friend .
if i go out the back , he 'll know you 've warned me .
that 's alright , i 'll figure something out .
this is sam wilder , marshal in devil 's cauldron . had some killings here . i got a suspect ; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands .
on a good day i could n't spare a crosswalk guard . but now , no way . folks 're batshit with the weather turning sour . bring him in yourself .
i can give you freedom of movement , freedom to work , freedom , helmuth . but i need something in return .
major , we 're discussing a man of genius , i do n't want ...
gosh , this is really a great conversation -- i ca n't believe i said that out loud .
you know , this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing ...
steve , my brother is n't as bad as he 's painted . he is n't perfect , but -
but he is n't going to like this , susie . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i would n't give him a second thought if not for you .
well , thanks for your help mr. rosenfeld and i 'm sorry my mother would n't go out with you , i 'm sure she would have had a really great time .
i would have tried to show her a good time . i promised her when she left that i would never forget her and i never did . stanley rosenfeld does not forget .
what are you guys , taking an all-night tour ?
we 're gay lovers , what 's it to you ?
why do you go on about that ? what does it matter ?
you 've been to bed with somebody else , have n't you ?
you see , we have those oil interests in venezuela - and i just got a cable from dad - the board of directors decided on a merger .
a merger ? how long will you be gone ?
no , wait ! i like your tits . i love your tits . i want to fuck you .
good . now we 're getting somewhere . not a chance .
yeah , i have , i have , yeah .
yeah , you know , when you called i thought , there 's a name from the past .

decay unfortunately does n't limit itself to the denture , mr. baker . it spreads into his chest . then the heart goes . we would n't want that , would we ?
jorgensen 's been runnin ' his cattle with my own ...
your cattle ? ... < u > debbie 's < /u > cattle !
neighborhood watch ? is that what you call listening in on stranger 's phone conversations ?
these ai n't strangers , they 're neighbors . this only picks up signals in a half-mile radius .
i was a treasury agent for eight years . why ?
treasury ... then this would be your first actual murder scene .
a decent meal every once in a while would n't hurt either , this road food is crap .
if i never eat at another waffle house again , i can die a happy girl .
just - say it . say it just once .
one thing at a time . i 'll see you in twenty minutes . go .
not really ... maybe a couple of peacemakers ... i imagine you could overlook those , eh , bill ? if you did n't see them ... or hear them ?
i guess not , bob . i do n't like guns around .
so , what , why ca n't you do that here ? what 's wrong with here ? why is somewhere else better ?
why should i stay here , jeff ? so we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change , while you bitch about burnfield ?
well , uh , who notices workers , sir ?
no one should have to . have him brought to me .
yeah , but here you are . how 'd i get so lucky ? i thought you were trying to forget i was alive .
that 's not true . you 're the one who 's trying to forget .
i understand if ya do n't like the buzz-sucker ! just lem me keep my job , i 'm prayin ' to ya !

jesus , rachel , what 's got into you ?
do you think i did n't hear her tonight , crying as if her heart would break ? here she is thinking church is going to die .
no , no ! maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies , or perhaps some slightly fried pansies , or better still , some stuffed shirts . and guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck .
say , who 's been tying your ties lately ? it looks rotten .
do n't get me wrong , jake . i like you boys . you guys are the steadiest business in town . but what can i say ? twenty percent 's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals .
all the shit we pulled with you and you 're trying to shake us down ? you guys got sack .
she likes old movies like i do , that 's all . besides , she does n't really know me . she thinks she does , but she does n't . maybe it 's because she 's mormon and i 'm catholic .
maybe it 's because she 's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up , it 's inevitable that it will in some way .
what i 'm trying to say is this is a board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the board .
i 'm sure you 'll see to it that it wo n't be a problem .
that 's right , buzz , and you know when i did it ? last match , last frame . all i needed was one spare for the crown - and i get stuck with the seven-ten , the fazeli split .
you never even took the shot . you could n't do it . theo moves towards buzz in a threatening manner .
i do n't want to leave the convent , mother .
i 'm afraid that his health is not good . he 's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows . you will certainly never see him again .
you 're nuts ! i 'm a comic strip artist ! what 's he gon na do - draw < u > really scary cartoons < /u > ? ?

no one hated them more than you , gal'na . we 've come a long way together . this is the moment we 've planned for so many years ...
your lawyers feel it 's the ... `` smoking gun . ''

attending to heroes ? no sir . my only regret is that i was never able to be out there with you .
no problem , consider it done . i had this idea of shooting on location . outdoors , you know ? maybe at some famous xenia landmarks . you think that would be a problem ?
we 'll send you the release forms , ted . our staffers will help in any way they can .
they saw you coming a mile away . if i had known we 'd be using --
it 's too late now . okay ? we 'll have to deal with these .
i pay thy poverty , and not thy will .

you 're very clever , are n't you ... ?
i am only what you are -- - what all of you have been . what do you think of yourself now , my love ... ?

here -- here it is . here 's your pocketbook , kringelein .
oh -- yes -- that 's it -- you found it -- you found it for me , baron .
suppose i wanted to search the cabins , all twelve ... would i need a warrant ?
look , if you wo n't believe me , go ahead . you can help me make beds if you like . come on .
shit ! bela , what 's with the gun ?
why are n't you on your honeymoon ? where 's myrna ?
yeah , but it 's got everybody sore . ads are being pulledthe governor 's starting a libel suitwhat 's more , they all know john doe 's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him .
well , what about it ? let them see him ! we 'll go them one better . they can also hear him . you own a radio station , mr. norton . why not put him on the air ?
it was not -- it was murdo 's . those mckendricks do n't know how to act like human beings .
his son is worse than he was . he 's smoother , so you do n't always hear him coming , but he 'll do anything to keep his range free .
if i told you  you would n't believe me -- but this much i can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you . take a friend 's advice -- an old man ' s advice -- leave her alone -
that 's ridiculous -- thea 's lovely , gentle -
we had given up digging in a certain barrow . i went back and i tried again . i just had a hunch .
a hunch -- that 's all i 've got about this leopard thing . it 's just a hunch , yet i feel it deep in the stomach . it was a man !
i 'll bet anything he wo n't go to town nor he wo n't ride out on the range . right off he 'll hole up at the ranch .
i ai n't waitin ' , bill . i 'll look in on your youngsters when i get back .
now what could he sell at three in the morning ?
flashlights . luminous dials for watches . house numbers that light up .
that 's what you 've been looking for -- a farter ?
i 've been looking for a guy -- not one of these south beach pussies .
we have already captured a dozen incendiaries , convicts , released just two days ago . they said they were acting under orders of the secret police .
but to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible ? it would take a carefully organized plan , tons of combustibles and hundreds of people .
come on ... tell me there was n't just a little ... something between us that first night at the bar . the night we danced .
what difference does it make ... we 're both going to starve to death , or get squished , or set on fire ...
oh , no -- no ! my dear *senator* -- it may be customary out on the prairie to take french leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours --
gee -- i 'm sorry about that , miss -- you *are* miss saunders , are n't you ?
if i could lay my hands on those letters , i could make a fortune .
so could i. and i 'm a poor businessman .
hey , listen ! do you know what i think ? i ...
... think he was a wacko . and i think that g.i . ninja 's a bigger wacko . and i think you 're the biggest wack- ...
you would n't mind living in the nicest house in town , buying your wife a lot of fine clothes , a couple of business trips to new york a year , maybe once in a while europe . you would n't mind that , would you , george ?
would i ? you 're not talking to somebody else around here , are you ? you know , this is me , you remember me ? george bailey .
i wanted to be loved completely . my body throbbed excitedly . oh brad , brad my darling , how could i have done this to you ?
and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again . so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one you 've found is back again .
when peter was little , he loved to hide . in closets , under the sink . he needed a secret place . but when i 'd look for him , he 'd laugh ... he wanted to be found .
i do n't think he wants me to find him .
listen to me , johnny . come in ! you 're out there all alone ... we 're getting close ... real close ... maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
i 've already got something worked out . be seeing you .
sounds like a bad idea to me , probally just get in the way .
yeah , well i guess it 's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid 's missing ... besides , ai n't no such thing as an ex-cop .
well , you ever need one , i know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal . lotsa shit around .
the cops and company raise hell they find out .
it 's cozy girl holding on ... cozy girl and backtrack ...
i 'm en route . e.t.a . in five .
there is always a way ! but you are such a ... a glotzkopp you can not see ! you 'd rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land !
land ! are you crazy ? i 'm no amishman and i 'm no farmer ! i 'm a cop . that 's what i know and that 's what i do !

then -- this is *not* you signature , senator ?
i 'm sergeant sykes , and this is detective jetson , los angeles police department .
sergeant ... detective . i was n't aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet .
eve was incredibly modest . she insisted that no credit was due her , that lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them .
the implication being that i have not been reading them as written .
do i have to dial '9 ' to get out ?
i do n't care who you dial , so long as it 's not me . next -
i spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist . i should have been here at the hospital with my brother , but i was with you .
if you did n't want to do it , you should have said so ! is this about gas money ?
what about me ? are n't i a loose end ?
when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want . i 'll be long gone . besides , who 's going to believe you ? you 're just a two-bit crook .
yes . i did n't plan it that way .
and did you fantasize that vaughan was photographing all these sex acts ? as though they were traffic accidents ?
at the first sight of the morning 's rays ' light ...
i know the laws of the night . i state there is still time for yet another .
sure , like this low-grade shit here , some girl in a fight with her boyfriend ... it 's a test-pattern . nothing happens . i 'm snorin ' .
hey , you 're always saying , 'bring me real life . bring me street life . and , like , one man 's mundane and desperate existence is another man 's technicolor . '

what 's a texas smokey doing in arkansas , man ?
if i knew , cledus ; i 'd be on college bowl .
who cares ? ! you hired an actor ? ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about . who told you that ?
they knew the risks when they signed on . i 've come too far to turn back now .
then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny .
art . that 's a good subject . you start it off .
you start it off . i do n't know anything about it .
we used to meet here on special occasions . who would like to convene the meeting ?
`` we went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life . '' anybody want to read ?

save it for your mother , funny guy . we heard it before .
i want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between reforma and the freeway junction . in minutes .
you 're lying . i do n't believe you .
we both have shiny happy fits of rage . you want more fans , i want more stage . i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
you are always trying to keep it real . i 'm in love with how you feel . i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
would it matter if they hit at a flat angle ? i mean , do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger ?

he 's dead , james . believe me , i know a dead dog when i see one .
she 's as much as said so . but she does n't want to share her toy with anyone else ... it 's just an ego thing with her .
fight fire with fire . threaten to go to her husband .
the cape . the turban . she would n't understand .

i 'm not fighting you , jim , i 'm just trying to reach you . you 've changed .
of course , i 've changed ! my eyes have opened , and once they 're open , believe me , what used to look normal seems insane ! and now king . do n't you think this has something to do with that ? ca n't you see ?
in that event , we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately . some means to get us back to civilization .
are you so certain you are away from it ?
you 're the one with balls , dick , say something like that to someone like glenn . or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute .

oh ! no ! no ... of course not ... it 's just i had n't expected it to be quite so big .
well , it 's not called the horn resounding for nothing . you do know how to play the horn , do n't you ?
guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers . as least that 's what the word is .
what 's to stop him from just ripping me off then ?
i saw his soul wesley . he was face to face with his god , and no one lies in that situation . but your geronimo act rattled me , and i abandoned my instincts . never abandon you instincts .

you do n't seem like the type who does business with mr. shreck .
no . and you do n't seem like the type who takes orders from him .
such a simple matter . this figure is the symbol of the palladists .
it 's all clear to me now -- so clear .
i sure am . the goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind kennedy . and he was supporting brown . people were scared , that 's why .
i suppose castro staged the whole thing just to beat you .
do you want to unclench your fists , please ? thank you . i can see in the dark , you know . i 've been here quite a while .
i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you , mr. robinson . i am trying to tell you i do not resent you .
i do n't . i just know they were there when i left . i 'm giving you helpful information is all . you know , instead of wasting time interrogating me , we should be out there trying to find out who did this .

yes , sir . what is it , sir ? anything happened3
anything happened ? i 've got to get dressed ! i ca n't meet her like this !
d.k . -- did n't know -- who i was when the options he bought took a bath . he reneged on me .
i told you not to go into that racket . you could 've been a doctor or a lawyer ,
with respect , sir , would we have the telegraph without fantasy ? would we have radium and x-rays without someone first dreaming we could ?
the advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation , a careful evolutionary process , not chalkboard parlor-tricks .
laura , you have to deal with all of this .
i 'm dealing with it , doc . big time . maybe i 'll make you a tape tomorrow . goodnight .
what can you tell us about the enemy we 're facing ?

that 's not the fucking point , whether you told the truth or not ! hello ... ?
i told the truth ... i told the truth .
hey ! do n't use all the hot water !
keep your shirt on ! i 'm almost done !
yeah , we hear you ! we 're coming back !
thank christ ! we lost you ! listen , there 's been a new development --
i 'm freakin out . oh god i 'm --
keep the phone open . i 'll call back . stay calm . he 's got some good doctors out there .

dignan . i ca n't do that . all right ? i just ca n't .
no , buddy , it was you who dropped it !
if you want , do it . i do n't care .
ca n't make a buck without my leopard . i tell you , mr. manning , you got ta find that cat for me -- or pay up .
look , charlie , just be patient . i 'll fix everything . you do n't want that cat , anyway . it killed two people .
how could you let me find out like this ?
stacy , i found out like this . this is the first i 'm < u > hearing < /u > of --
sure , but you was worried too , mother ; takin ' off with never a word of goodbye . i even got to figurin ' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em .
you and your gypsies ! they been gone a week !
thou hast a careful father , child : one who , to put thee from thy heaviness , hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor i looked not for .
madam , in happy time what day is that ?
mom ! for the last fucking time , i 'm telling you laura did n't want to get married ! she is not that kind of girl ! to use a phrase . that 's not what happens now .
well i do n't know what happens now , apart from you meet someone , you move in , she goes . you meet someone , you move in , she goes .
i am sorry . i only felt ... it seemed she was harming you . i meant ...
well ? you meant well ? people always mean well , they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that ...
we do n't know that 's true , he never said that .
i can feel it in the way he talks to me .
well , it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen japanese jobs .
the only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint -- -- which lasted . . . minutes ! well ! that 's some kind of record . talk about fast !
why not ? if you hit twenty homers this year you 'll be the all time minor league champ ! the record 's
home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor , if ya think about it .
not exactly , but with your great voice , it 'll be a huge hit . honest .
fat chance . you know , lee wilkins came to hear me last night . he told me to forget it . you told me to forget it . my parents tell me to forget it .
there are no other guests . we do n't want to share this night with other people . this is for you and me .
i understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the metropolitan and sat there listening to la traviata , all by himself . he was afraid of catching cold .
we 're not allowed to tell . may i have the stamps , please ?
here -- wait a minute -- how did carson dyle get an office in here , anyway ?
i 'm sorry , daniel , but you have to admit it 's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized . it 's got to mean something .
means ? oh no . we wo n't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it wo n't seem quite as funny to you , doctor frankenstein !
actually , mr. rieper . . . it 's a novel , and we 'll be sending it to new york . that 's where all the big publishing houses are based .
is that a fact ! you 'd better put me name down for an advance copy !
talk to him . you speak shellfish ! hey , look ... put it in the pot .
i ca n't ! i ca n't put him in the pot . i ca n't put a live thing in hot water .
i 'm seventeen . i know it like the back of my hand .
your fathered owned the entire `` heaven '' empire . you own it now . any questions ?
you ca n't take a cow by eminent domain .
we wo n't let him get hurt , ma'am .
i hereby declare this the charles dalton cave for passionate experimentation . in the future , anyone wishing entry must have permission from me .
wait a minute , charlie . this should belong to the club .
the coat ? a guy i did a favor once gave it to me . christ .
who 'd you ever do a favor for ? you just let some poor bastard freeze to death , would n't you ?
malcolm , you can be anything you want . you got class and you 're smart .
all them books you read and you still do n't know nuthin .
we had to see what your deal was . i 'm just a little superstitious .
here 's my deal -- do n't waste my time . what do you want me for anyway ? you do n't even know me .
where 's housekeeping ? they wo n't pick up .
sir , no one wants to work . they say the boss has left .
-- what , who ? oh she 's very nice , yes -- i mean normally -- -
-- cause she 's going to be very , very expensive .
i ca n't believe it ! but what about doug ?
there 's a world of guys out there . i just wish i did n't have to date any of them .
c.i.a. , mrs. lampert . we 're an extension of the wartime o.s.s . it was our money and we want it back .
i 'm sorry , mr. bartholomew , but nothing you 've told me has changed my mind . i still intend leaving paris -- tonight .
sporadic energy readings port side , aft . could be an impulse turn .
he wo n't break off now . if he followed me this far he 'll be back . but from where ... ?
he comes out of the cafeteria line , he 's nervous , he spills his corn , and he asks you to the dance !
marty , you have n't been listening . nobody 's asked me to the dance ... yet .
perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night , lieutenant . there were things i tried to tell you too - about having faith .
you 've betrayed the federation - all of you .
i cant tell you that yet . but hes being well looked after .
oh no . youll have to do better than that , mr lombard .
i 'm just not the type . besides , i want to get out of here .
but you have a vision . do n't you want to help your parents ?
yeah . we 're in the elevator . how 's it look back there ?
it looks pretty good . there 's nobody back here .
i dunno . i just said she 's nice lookin ' .
and i said so what . you think she 's any happier ?
so what are you up to today , miles ?
just kickin ' back , i guess . i do n't know . jack and i were supposed to go golfing .
he does n't want my help any more . he does n't need it .
we do n't know that 's true , he never said that .
jack - - please - - wipe that lunatic grin off your face .
ha ! that 's the best part . i ca n't ! !
he asked for a loan of it , did n't he ?
yes -- but i did n't give it to him --
indy ... indy , you must hurry ! ! come quickly !
it 's ... a leap of faith . oh , god .
i thought it was you - how are you ?
i 'm good - i was just making a delivery near here , so i thought i would see if you were about ...
as stories must when love 's denied -- with tears and a journey . those whom god has joined in marriage , not even i can put asunder .
lord wessex , as i foretold , has lost his wife in the play- house -- go make your farewell and send her out . it 's time to settle accounts . how much was the wager ?
his medical condition is reported as ... & quot ; terminal. & quot ;
he 's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years .
hey ! wait a minute ! there 's no birthday party for me here !
thank you , desmond . what 's the reason for your truancy ?
i have sectors 1-28. i think hector has the upper levels .
we 'd better get everybody online . and kyle , stop downloading porn . your frame rate is unacceptable .
seems like there 's more of it than ever before --
well , with the expanding global population -- let me ask you this -- your wife . has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the `` knock-out , sexy woman '' you described ?
why do n't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the kommandant on one end and you on the other .
it is not me . it is the orders . i am your friend . i am your best friend here .
please let me know when you hear from daddy , get a number or something .
i will . and good luck with your show . i hope it 's a huge success . you 've worked very hard . you deserve it .
i 've covered everything . and you 're the best , so --
you 're overestimating yourself again . what 's worse , this time you 're overestimating me .
why do n't you people let me alone ? i 'm minding my own business . you mind yours .
if you 'd just let me talk to you for a little while , miss alexander . all i want to ask you ...
this is dangerous shit , dean ; we do n't even know who lives in there .
listen , i do n't care who lives in there ; all as i know it 's got to be preferable to death by hatchet .
oh , well , then , have him killed and get it over with .
hey , do n't be such a fuckin ' smartass , will you ? i mean , i know the fuckin ' guy thirty-five years , i 'm gon na fuckin ' whack him for you ? fuck ... motherfucker ! i knew this , i knew it .
stable . we 're looking at low twenties . it 's a good number , considering the fallout from --
reed 's disaster . you know , i half- think he did this to me on purpose .
i guess i got a little overexcited . was n't it incredible ! i 'm telling you , this is a first . you know what this could mean to the university ?
oh , yeah . this could be bigger than the microchip . they 'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us . we 're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady .
sorry about the glass . and the house . and the breath .
mr. fairlane , i 'm very rich . the kind of rich that warps minds . nothing offends me . when i was eleven , i walked in on my father and the shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday . does that excite you ?
it 's not true , but it feels true .
there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
from me the doctor has no secrets . poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that ?
i did n't really do anything -- honest -- i mean , you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you 're serious -- marriage-wise .
yes ! i need to speak to sheriff von teer .
he 's in a meeting . could i have him --
it 's better to split up , to increase our chances . we must change hiding places , and change them continually ... in the meantime , we must make new contacts , replace our arrested brothers , reorganize our sections --
yes , but we must also show them that we still exist .
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries -- she 's either hungry or she 's tired -- rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that .
do n't worry , willow . she 's in good hands . you have n't made a mistake .
use the little brush there . why were you at santos ' ?
found one of the missing victims from that boat deal .
look at me . look at what they gave me to wear .
you never looked better in your life . as soon as our clothes are cleaned , they 're going to give them back to us , lovey .
what'dya tell that soldier , soldier ? you tell him we was rebels ?
he 's my contact for chrissake ! there 's two crates . can you get me into the hospital ?
naughty , naughty , naughty , you filthy old soomaka .
no ! no ! do n't touch it . that 's a very important work of art . what the bloody hell do you want ?
arnold babar . is n't there a children 's book about an elephant named babar ?
i do n't know . i do n't have any .
why ? just give me the address , you wo n't even have to be involved .
i do n't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and ...
i 'm gon na need that hand back , ed .
what ? ah yes . of course . i 'm sorry . it 's just that ... you 're my idol . and some people have been trying to keep us apart .
you - wait ! you did n't see that you were being set up on the second win ?
i really think you 're overreacting in this whole -
you 're just like you mother ! always jealous !
that 's why mom ran away , because you had to control everything !
oh , no , you wanted to get together with your close friend , pony , the rockstar . i understand . so you , do you , want us to , leave ?
no . we were just gon na go someplace or something to ...
no , i could n't get my hands on one .
have you reported to your probation officer as directed ?
thanks . sure is a hot day for driving . late afternoon is better . you guys have plenty of time . make pittsburgh in two , maybe three hours .
hey , he 's right ! whaddya say , charlie , huh ? play a little pool ? wait out the heat ?
oh my g-d , i read about this ! it 's called a `` pregnancy insanity . '' quick , she needs a sitz bath --
look , i might be moody . i might be gassy . but i am perfectly sane . think about it . in school , they tell us , `` dreams can come true . '' right ?
that night in the cave -- that was n't wine they gave me to drink ... it was blood ! david 's blood . i 'm one of them , star ! i 'm just like them !
not yet ... you 're like laddie and me ... half-vampires ... you 're not a full vampire until you 've made your first kill ... you were supposed to be mine ... but i could n't , michael .
crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea , huh ?
yeah , but not now ... these will all make it ... guaranteed .
there < u > should n't < /u > be any . only plant forms were built into the genesis matrix .
cross referenced and verified . an unidentifiable life form reading .
we both left the hustle and bustle of uptown , harlem ...
... the big apple , new york , new york .
no , i do n't ... no . i thought we were just friends .
what you think , you know , does n't have much to do with reality . i mean , i hope i 'm not the first to say that about you .
he 's got the most beautiful eyes ... the hell kind of question is that ? he 's a guy .
send him packing . i 'm not walking all the way over there .
this may be hard for you to understand ... but i 'm duty-bound not to interfere with you , or anyone else here ... any more than is absolutely necessary .
you 've been interfering with my life ever since i met you . do n't stop now .
what you have done is betray every man on this ship .
worse . i have betrayed you . i do not expect you to forgive me .
there 's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill .
that 's right . will you see that mr. sheldrake gets it ?
my name is jeffrey beaumont - i live near you . i believe you know my father , tom beaumont - beaumont 's hardware store ?
sure i do . i understand he 's in the hospital . how is he ?
yeah , i read your book . `` mike '' had the same problems as `` chad '' the stockbroker .
yes . the pressures you feel , and again , i am neither labeling nor judging them , are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you 're in a rut . so stop the tom foolery -- the shenanigan 's , will .
but we ca n't turn away ! is there no alternative ?
there is one , but i can not guarantee its success . we could attempt to find some humpback whales .
here 's to you , luther . to being off the disavowed list .
hey , i 'm the flavour of the month !
here it is ! according to the old will joanne braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
what good does that do -- it 's the old will ?
do n't worry , i 'll settle up with your boss . we have n't skipped town yet .
what i 'm saying is , is that the king ai n't gon na care . see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy , if you ask me i think he 's jealous .
he said i was right . i should n't wait for him . i was better to make a clean break .
i think it 's very sensible in the circumstances .
you do the praying . i 've work ahead .
there 's the spirit , lad . if ye run into trouble , give a yank here and we 'll haul ye up .
yeah ? and just how much of all this has been `` doing your job '' ?
let me ask you something , do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills ? who the hell are you kidding ? i was there , remember ? i saw you and your brother --
that would be the girl who opened the door . are the others inside ?
the mother is in florida visiting her sister . the father works at home , so he 's probably inside .
we 've got to turn the faucet off on this thing . it 's out of control ... you might burden just me with this in the future .
it 's helms -- it 's got to be .
you think anyone who 's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser .
no . i think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss ' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser .
it 's a single malt , glenmorangie . i thought you 'd like it . anything you need , gentlemen , let me know .
oh , paul , talk to the coat check , please .
so , did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life ?
i have the feeling , they got it down already . they 're a step ahead of us , artie .
yeah , i guess ... is this my fault ? is vanessa mad at you because of me ?
that 's not the point . we 're just not in love anymore .
put those things in the car and i 'll get your tie and studs together .
okay , mom . you coming later ? you coming later , george ?
this story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it 's finished .
actually , mr. rieper . . . it 's a novel , and we 'll be sending it to new york . that 's where all the big publishing houses are based .
then he 's coming home with his mother and me .
all right ... but you see our predicament ... legally we ca n't hold him , but he may be able to help us ... perhaps later . for now , he 's free to leave .
so , captain hawk , in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about thou . in the autre , you got lead that wo n't get you gelato .
surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference .
so . i receive per cent just for finance and legal protection . no worries about operations , is that what you tell me ?
if you think two million dollars in cash is just finance , i congratulate you don corleone .
feed , mostly . thought we 'd get something for the kids .
okay by me - i 'd sure like to see that opryland .
i know , we had a good time . but ever since you guys moved out here , it seems like we 've lost touch .
i know ; this a long way from watts . but what i like about living out here is that you do n't hear no helicopters , no sirens , no drive-by 's , no nothing . just peace and quiet . listen .
what about these low-level flights ? they 're starting in what ? an hour ? do you realize what you 're letting yourself in for ?
we need those flights . we have to know when those missiles become operational , because when they do , we need to destroy them .
better judgment ? ! to wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late ?
i 've done all i could with the laser .
a doll alone proves nothing . true . but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit .
your conclusion is premature . have you forgotten your scripture ? the thirteenth scroll ? 'and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden , and chained him to a tree , and the children made sport of him . '
what do you expect , mugging me from behind ?
i < u > tapped < /u > you .
i wo n't be seeing you again chris ; i have paid him every last penny .
i am sure you have , no one was accusing you of being dishonest , john .
i 've seen a lot of people die before .
i have n't . not like that . how do you get used to it ?
i 'm leaving , man . i 'm bailing town . this place has gotten way too hairy .
where am i gon na find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money ?
i do n't care whether it 's important or not . you said you were going out with me , and if you had n't promised so faithfully , i would n't have gone and planned the whole thing .
listen , it is n't so terribly important . we can go to the theatre any time .
now twenty seconds downrange ... perfect tommy , how on earth is buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground ?
she 's just a damn road hugger , allison . plus the man can drive .
the face decays , the mask does n't . art lasts , we do n't . that 's why art 's so valuable . it 's a little piece of immortality .
you got a real problem with priorities , you know that ?
maybe i do n't like the way you ask .
who gives a goddamn what you think ? you 're just a crook that 's got a weekendpass ... you 're not even a name anymore . just a spear- chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues ...
i do n't know . it was walled over . no one 's been down there in years .
you said you had plans of the museum . could we see them , please ?
no , do n't open it yet -- i 'll be embarrassed .
okay -- well , thank you . i do n't know what it 's for . but thank you anyway .
i knew it , i knew it . things are getting complicated .
no , john , things are getting real simple .
if she is well then nothing can be ill. her body rests in capel 's monument , and her immortal part with the angel 's lives . i saw her laid low . pardon me for bringing these ill news .
then i defy you , stars ! juliet ! juliet ! i will hence tonight .
i-i 'm sorry ... uh so ... uh ... how --
i dunno ... okay , i guess ... i fucked that guy josh finally ...
you looked oddly at me , back on the landing .
yes , it must be hard to be a policeman . is it hard ? must one , then , be constantly suspicious ?
i say we go over there and kick their asses . i can take the little one .
are you out your mind ? i 'm not messing with them s.a. 's boy . you must be crazy .
you would n't happen to remember if miz wilkes bought one , would you ?
are you kidding ? every time that fella writes a book , she makes me set aside the first copy .
they fear change . the new caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible . you could be the one , the emperor , the man who oversees the rebirth of the republic .
i 'll do anything in my power to help you restore the republic but i ca n't be that power .
george is great but i know what you mean .
face it , you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you 've got to find somebody . face it , time is n't on your side .
it 's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil , the less evil it becomes .
no , the less mystifying . good and evil are only illusions . there is no such thing as evil with a capital `` e. '' that suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings .
alvy , do n't ! you 're using sex to express hostility .
`` why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories ? he said as he removed her brassiere ... ''
frank , i have something for you . excuse us everyone .
excuse us por favor ! hey . let tits see her kid .
nope . if you 're a criminal you do n't carry id , and if you do you 're a damn fool .
i tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent .
johnny ! why did n't you tell me before ?
-- just before i ask you out ? i ca n't do that . let 's get out of here before good old les catches up with us again .
pardon me ? i 'm afraid i do n't ...
cancel lunch . make reservations at campton place for me and mr. butts .
she hears what she wants to hear , okay ?
maybe so . maybe she hears what you tell her .
oh , you mean of bonnie and clyde ? hm . you ever see pictures of him , the way he wore his hat ? you could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him .
i do n't recall his hat , but i 've seen pictures of him lying dead , shot by texas rangers . did you know he did n't have his shoes on ?
who ? some car hop , or a dress extra ?
why not ? what i 'm trying to say is that i 'm all wrong for you . you want a valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
paul , i need you to buy me a day or two . i do n't have the fuel for this convoy . i will have to scrounge it .
i ca n't . i have nothing left to bribe with . can your men at the gate hold out for another day ?
wow , dude . wendy could really give a rats ass about you .
i bet she would if my name was gregory ! !
sure . no place to bathe for days , sleeping in flea-infested beds ... they tell you all about that in those books ?
you know what i mean . i 'm getting married soon , but i have n't lived the life i want .
secret service agent carter . this is my calling , lee . give me six months and i 'll be in washington protecting a white guy .
we both know you would never take a bullet for someone else .
no doyle . vaughan do n't want to come to a party with you .
too late , honey . fooled you . done called him . he 'll be here . or i 'll go get him . come on karl , i need you to help me ice down a tub of beer , you and frank .
it could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it ...
you 've heard of her great interest in the theater-
i know . it 's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me .
it 's just a dumb game they play . you want to be at a bigger firm , get used to the politics .
you just stick by old barbatus . he 'll watch out for you . whatsamatter , kid ? leave a girl behind ?
yeah . well -- no . she 's kind of playing hard to get . as a matter of fact , she 's playing completely unattainable . so , what 's on the schedule ? a brisk walk ? a foraging expedition ?
looks like a design , some writing , maybe . maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message .
look closely . that is n't writing . those are grooves .
we see it . for the record , it reads `` lucille angstrom . '' what 's the point of this ?
well , that 's what i knew then . or who i knew , i should say . you see , i was trying to court miss angstrom . i went to the meeting to impress her .
i know . lloyd , let 's not start putting things on this level .
what ? this is a good level , is n't it ?
so you 're the one leading the americans , i shoulda figured . so what 's the scam ? you get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot ?
unfortunately no , these americans are smart , they pay me only half now , half when i get them back to cairo , so i must go all the way .
do n't be ridiculous , of course that wo n't happen .
have you been reading what minister jefferson has to say ? if he had his way , all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome . and that would destroy us as surely as a british victory .
you pitiful , miserable creatures ! you dare to challenge the power of darkness ? do n't you realize what you are dealing with ? he 's vigo ! you are like the buzzing of flies to him .
oh , johnny . did you back the wrong horse .
tem thousand dollars . everything i could spare . it 's for you .
but why ? you only owe me five . and that 's not till after we close the deal tonight .
what 's with you ? every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he 's family .
just thought maybe he 'd like a little coffee with his saliva .
a telegram -- a phone call might have helped .
seemed the most honest way to begin life together again -- natural , unrehearsed .
sit down and eat -- you 'll be late .
it 'd stick in my throat , mom . i 'm nervous or something --
you do ? still ? i ca n't tell you how happy i am to hear that .
you were the one who insisted on it . reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four .
lets us watch each other 's backs over a wide area . only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths . elt was in my duffel bag , not around my neck where it should 've been .
no way they 'll find you on a five-minute signal . and no way -more-
as a matter of fact , i 'm a pretty good cook -- but i 'm a lousy housekeeper .
yes , you are , when i was straightening up the couch , you know what i found ? six hairpins , a lipstick , a pair of false eyelashes , and a swizzle stick from the stork club .
are you , by any chance , going up to your base at clavius ?
yes , as a matter of fact , i am .
let me just keep going a while . she might remember something ?
< u > what < /u > ? she 's < u > blind < /u > , bro . you may as well ask one of these beethoven guys on the piano ?
come on , i 'll buy you a drink . there 's a big thing over at the italian embassy .
i 'm not sure i 'd be good company tonight .
well , thank the lord you can always depend on new england for weather . we 've got enough for the whole united states .
i feel -- fidgety , ma -- not right at all .

i ca n't believe tommy 's still pissed at me . he knows i 'm moving away , right ?
he 's been acting real strange lately . he wo n't even look me in the eyes anymore .
what is this `` i , i , i '' stuff ? you only talk about yourself ? are n't you glad to see me ? do n't i look nice ?
sorry . you look great . i 'm totally exhausted .
i saw it with my own eyes . we 've killed an extraterrestrial and ...

well , er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning .
that 's right . -- rubbers , too , i hope ? a man ought to be prepared for any emergency .
just as well . the new people just painted it some god-awful color --
we found a body out by the army base yesterday . been there for a long time .
we 're screwed now ! we do n't get shit and they 're gon na kill her ! we 're fucked , walter !
dude , nothing is fucked . come on . you 're being very undude . they 'll call back . look , she kidnapped her --
if i 'm so far from the truth , why is the fbi bugging our offices ? why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered ? why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before ?
maybe 'cause there 's some rogue element in the government !
he did more work on the car . he wants fifty bucks extra for it .
fifty dollars more . that 's a lot of money when you do n't have a dime . and where 'd you plan on getting the money from ? maybe you thought you 'd pay your friend jake mckenna a visit .
i told you this was fuckin ' dangerous . remember i said , 'ginger , this is a dangerous situation . be very careful . ' you fuckin ' yessed me to death .
if it 's so fuckin ' dangerous , then why do n't you kill him ?
i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper . hey , wait a minute !
i 'm late for a date with a dame .
well , i have n't played in a while because of these kidney pains .
right , and how long have you had these pains , mr. barber ?
i 'm making a film . jim sullivan 's going to be in it . he said you might know where tod is .
do i know you ? were n't you on the set the other night ? with ramada .
i think no such a thing . sal pays you , you should work .
slavery days are over . my name ai n't kunta kinte . sis , i do n't want to argue , stop pressing me .
which of you is willing to make that sacrifice ?
you would ! you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power .
if i wanted him dead , you moron , i would n't have dumped him on earth .
we ca n't let him run around . he knows too much .
it 's working ! oh , doctor -- you play beautifully .
do you know the theme from 'doctor zhivago ' ?
no ... yeah , fine , go ahead ... so what 's this about ? is this about me ?
i 'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next ... .i thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting .
oh , come on , tripp . cut the kid some slack .
it 's just ail that crap he spins out . just once i 'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth .
get me a couple of beers and a salami .
we could make a start on the floor afterwards .
... everything is not about me , do n't make me the villain here . that asshole was out of line , and you goddamn well know it ...
... i 'm sorry , i do n't see it that way ...
is that what that is ? i never seen any before . i always thought that stuff was expensive !
oh , yeah . it can get real expensive .
neither do i , actually . but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me .
mr. gittes , you 're not making a bit of sense .
-- what ? -- i 'll see you later ...
-- okay -- -- i 'll see you later . your house .
thanks for the loan , man . i 'll have it in a few days , i promise .
well i hope so . that pretty much cleaned me out .
children ? well , we really do n't encourage them . they 're so noisy and troublesome , do n't you agree ?
yes . and so terribly annoying when they cry . i just do n't know what to do when they cry , do you dear ?
you just ca n't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand . you could charge halfdan twenty and he 'd pay it .
oh , i could n't do that ! the blacksmith 's code says ...
i should have suspectcd , when i heard that 'doctor . ' i thought it was your father .
it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .
i guess what i 'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan ?
what do you mean what kind of person ? he 's a good person .
i will look at them , of course , the moment i can . it will be an honour . please give him my warmest .
would it be too much trouble , sir , to ask you to look at them now ? while i wait .
it 's good to see you again , uncle . i 've missed you .
as i 've missed you . sleep well , child .
santa carla has become a haven for the undead .
as a matter of fact , we 're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at city hall .
... no treasure ... i had two weeks left on my sentence ...
i could n't wait two weeks ! she 's gettin ' married tomorra !
so i 've been told . practically an obsession of your .
call it a passion . i 've got to get going .
only to get my foot in the door . showing initiative , right ?
you were referred here by the department of employment . there 's no need for you to get you `` foot in the door '' , as you put it .
because if they do n't , i 'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever !
well . i 'd love to see that , but after taking counsel with my captains , i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city , then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything .
picked it up in shanghai -- which has also seen better days .
it 's cracked -- and you never use it . and it 's too ornate . i 'm sending up a plain , flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved .
i fear our meeting is long overdue ... napoleon .
i 'm sorry that i am unable to offer you better hospitality , but this is the only place i have inhabited for the past month .
in sicily , when you attack a man , you had better finish him .
i wish they had . he takes fifty dollars a week from my father 's cash drawer . but you ca n't kill a man like fanucci .
what 're you talking about ? they love it .
i 'm gon na throw up , frank . i mean it . let 's drop it for the ten o'clock , okay ?
well , of course , it 's always dangerous ...
i know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ?
by red , what rank would you say this black , officer , soldier is , colonel ?
i , do n't know what color is what officer , my lord ...
there are a lot of lonely people in the world . somebody 's gon na figure this out someday .
it 's not going to be me . i 'm giving it up .
well , spats colombo - if i were saw one .
hello , copper . what brings you down to florida ?
let 's not get lewd . i 'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation .
come on . i think it would be a turn-on .
where 's ever'body else ? you seen 'em ? i thought i told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway .
how does a feller go about gettin ' ahold of the police ?
something must have gone wrong . i guess i 'll try number two .
when you get up to a hundred , wake me up .
why back me then ? why not back yourself ? go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich . you know all the angles .
i 'm already rich . but i like action . that 's one thing i think you 're good for is action . besides , like i say ... you got talent .
i 'm not scared . so many people have died around me . but i would be a shame for us . i do n't feel like being shy .
you must get away . before i cut . i 'm not cutting if you 're here . he 's struggling . he 's going to topple over if he cuts .
i wo n't allow it . those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . what do you think of that ? that 's from my quote book .
the office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased .
ann arbor is n't ... that far from cleveland , right ?
nah . once i get my own wheels , i could come up all the time .
how come you 're so brave with all this stuff ?
tradition . royal sense of adventure that 's been in my family for centuries . dates back to the crusades and king richard . what i was born to do .
i allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with .
like to oblige you , arletta , but right off i do n't know where to put my hands on 'em .
see you replaced a mooring line , lately . this one 's new .
naw , i had that around for a while .
i would n't have put it quite that way , but ...
wesley did n't even want to come up here . he warned me , but i insisted ... i have to ask you , betty ... are you crazy ?
it took you long enough to get my ass out .
with all those holes nels pumped in i knew you would n't suffocate .
do n't snap at me like that . you 're lucky i do n't punch you right in the face .
do n't snap at me like that . you 're lucky i do n't punch you right in the face .
they certainly do . they certainly do . come , let me take you to lunch .
that 's very kind of you , mr. bialystock , but i ...
let me be taken , let me be put to death . i have more care to stay then will to go . come death , welcome , juliet wills it so . how is't my soul ? let us talk it is not day .
it is , it is ! hie hence , be gone , away . o , now be gone . more light and light it grows .
the battle is over . the war is over . you 've won !
if you win , you know , you have to stay . it 's the losers who get to go home . besides , i 'm not so sure it is over . centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines .
i want to know where i come from . the remans gave me a future . you can tell me about my past .
there 's so much , and so much of it is dull ...
that 's not the reason i 'm here . i swear it .
there 's another reason ? it better be good .
it 's dark in there . penelope and that 's where he is !
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another .
choose your targets men . that 's right watch those markers .
keep steady . you 're the best shots of the twenty-fourth . you bunch of heathens , do it
now you listen to me hay-seed ! if you do n't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you 'll start giving me straight answers , you got that ! !
alright , alright ! we were just fucking with him..you know ?
okay , so i just got things started . but you could build on that . you could keep it going .
i am sorry , mary clarence . i seem to have misplaced my tambourine . good day , mary clarence .
i know that . i 'm warped ... i 'm warped !
god , algeria ! do you know there 's a bunch of ... they walk around there ... god ! people walk around with masks and things on their heads . they 're a bunch of crazy people there .
all right . tell you what i 'll do . first thing monday , i 'll look over the witwer evidence and i 'll have gideon run the containment files , see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was ?
anne lively ... but i never said she drowned .
oh , my , `` a summit conference . '' i wonder where i was , polishing silver behind the coal bin .
i do n't know where you were , penis envy .
i 'll see you burn . i 'll see you dead -- get away from me ! !
miss vale , was it something i said ? do you want to sniff my flower ?
mr. gordon , did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs. lippman ?
no . wait ... was she a great , fat person ? i may have seen her , i 'm not sure ...
mr. deeds , does the name of martin w. semple mean anything to you ?
not much . he 's an uncle of mine , i think . i never saw him , but my mother 's name was semple , you know .
you 're thinking with your gun , seamus , and not your head ...
shut up ! ! ! shut up and drive ! i 'm your superior officer and you will do as i goddamn well say , is that understood ? ! ?
for the last ten miles i 've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up . i 'm getting to the point where i do n't think there 's any place named sonora .
it 's a long ways yet . i figure we ought to camp . she 's tired .
give me a break . remember manzini ? when he stole montezuma 's scepter he left a pepto bismal bottle . the best ones always copy mac .
you 're saying the thief wants us to think it 's mac but it 's really not .
laurie , wait . i 've got a spare room . it 's empty . if you 'd like . . . laurie oh daniel , thanks , but i could n't . you 'd just be all nervous about --
no , screw that . what you were saying before , it 's absolutely right . -- i 'd love to have you stay .
nick . i 'm so scared . i 'm so fuckin ' scared to go home .
i know . it 's like coming from the moon . or mars .
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb .
why did n't you take all your clothes off ? you could have stopped forty cars .
it is n't in your hands , mama . it 's my life .
yes , but important people are concerned about this . judge hillier spoke to alma styles --
it was after you , baby . after you .
boy , that sauna is really ... ca n't you turn it down or something ?
i feel like we 've barely spent any time together since we got here .
that 's because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos .
a jedi 's power is measured by the amount of the force that is stored within him , and i have little of the force left in me .
how can you store an energy field within you ?
sorry , brother . i did n't mean any offence .
oh . oh , you 're sorry are you , well you must think i 'm awfully stupid . he slaps alex in the face .
you wan na raise the bet ? two on the five , five on the nine ?
you know what , kid ? i think maybe you 're a hustler .
one credit card receipt for swedish- made penis enlarger pump , signed austin powers .
i 'm telling you , baby , that 's not mine .
of course , elaine . but as long as there 's any question , better johnny should come back and clear his name .
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace !
i 'll ask randal to close up for me when he gets back .
where 'd he go ? i 'd have thought he 'd be at your side , like an obedient lapdog .
... got no day , got no date . probably ai n't worth a duck 's fart . this one here cost me $ and it 's got every doodad you can imagine . no sir i 'll stick with this .
you son of a bitch ! i 'll have my lawyers shut you down .
he 's taken over the case because ... they 're annoyed the previous chap let dickie ... disappear when he was the only , he was the only suspect in freddie 's murder .
quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor ripley ha visto il signor greenleaf ?
i know that now . he 's a fucking psycho .
well , do n't blame me . i told you .
god 's victim . that 's her innocence . she belongs to god .
and i intend to take her away from him . that 's what you 're afraid of is n't it ?
business is business . do n't have to love 'em to work with 'em . not if there 's money in it .
you are the one , wyatt . you sure are .
and , cut ! print it ! let 's move on !
do n't you want a second take , for protection ?
now , dr. towler 's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?
it 's my opinion it took him much longer . nine ... ten minutes . there 's too much brain damage .
now , you 've got more sense than to put nosey onto this guy -- !
wait -- wait . let 's see -- watchdog mcgann -- he 's bound to move right in -- get him out of the way first -- pardon me , friend -- i 've got some telephoning to do -- !
all this stuff -- it 's all about boats . i think i 'm in the shipping business .
see . it 's starting to come back , yeah ? you mind if i take a bath ?
this morning , a lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons . i explained we had only my late father 's sword , which , in fact , was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory .
a sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for .
geth thee to be and rest , for thou has need .
farewell . god knows when we shall meet again .
it 's not our affair . even if wudan accepts her , her husband might object .
i thought by giving away the sword , i could escape the giang hu world . but the cycle of bloodshed continues .
i do n't really need to practice . i just play a few notes , you know , so i thought maybe i 'd stay in .
well , i 'm sure your father and i would love to hear what you 're playing these days . maybe after dinner .
i 've read your interim memo on lecter . you sure you 've left nothing out ?
it 's all there , sir , practically verbatim .
you know , he 's got ta realize everything ca n't be a home run that he does .
yeah , well , that 's exactly what i keep tellin ' him , but that 's the kind of kid he is ever since he 's born .
this is malcolm , our new guest . we 'll treat him like a brother .
i was special . the only colored kid in class . i became a sort of mascot . like a pink poodle .
you do n't have to lose your temper ! that 's what you told me the last time too . every time i step in to protect you . at the elk 's dance [ ] when that big swede made a pass at you
he did n't make a pass at me ! i told you a million times !
that is n't it . it 's ... the loneliness , mr. scratch ... the loneliness !
the loneliness ? lonely with all your gold , mister stevens ? that hardly makes sense .
i did n't say i remembered killing him . i just repeated some words to get myself back in there .
i know . [ beat ] i knew that when you came out .
heaven on earth ? master , i do n't understand . a temple , where heaven is on earth ? a mountain , where earth reaches for the --
it 's a massage parlor downtown . `` heaven on earth . '' you will find your answers there .
and that 's the best part . `` teacher-student relations : how close is too close ? '' we 're gon na blow the lid off it !
there is no lid ! nothing 's going on between sam and me . coulson . mr. sam coulson and me .
that 's ... well , that 's very generous , but if you 've already got a store ... ?
the days of the storefront grocery are numbered . i plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket .
hay pasado un accidente muy grave -- [ there 's been a bad accident -- ]
in english , enrique . we 're in the united states --
well , uh , i - i got ta get the family farm back before i can start thinkin ' about that .
well that 's right ! if then ! believe me , delmar , woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man !
it 's already done . i 've already done it . you have to pay me now .
i do n't have to pay you nothin ' .
he came to see you yesterday . right before he got tagged . what did you talk about ?
the mets . john does n't think they 've got a deep enough pitching roster this year , and i 'm inclined to agree .
see you ? he can smell you from there .
oh god , he 's coming over here , act natural , totally natural .
they got a cuban band that 's the berries . why do n't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn ?
you know something , mr. fielding ? you 're dynamite !
that ca n't be right . that would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned . we 'd all be dead .
no . every product contains one component . the elements react in combination . hair spray wo n't do it . but hair spray and perfume and lipstick will . untraceable . it 's very elegant .
you 've reported that you felt strong thought emotions . a group of minds from a space vessel ? could you make out any plan , anything to do with earth ?
negative , captain . i could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic . i can explain nothing more ; i understand nothing more .
uh . . . no , man . i got some work to finish up here .
workin ' overtime ? what are you doin ' , buddy , looking for a raise ?
i just gave up smoking . a last drink ?
i 'm running a little late . you see , i 'm having a party at < u > the < /u > club to introduce the new lead singer for black vomit . everyone in the industry will be there , including our friend , don cleveland .

he 's in the bathroom ... he 's fine .
you know what i mean when i say `` it . ''
gotcha . no need to get anatomically correct with me , rex .
i will melt that gold and pour it down your throat , old man !
he sees betrayal everywhere . he will attack us so long as he is conscious .
we been through these off-seasons before -- we made it .
what we make it to ? the next season to work ourselves to death , share croppin ' for ol ' man howard , so he can get richer and we ca n't even eat when the croppin ' time is done ?
we 'll find out what they are when you throw us out .
that 's all the commitment you 're offering me ? or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation ?
i 'm tired . i 'm sorry , i should go . i 've been enough of a nuisance .
let me go get some clothes on . we 'll talk , okay ? be right back .
what 'd you rent ? best of both worlds ?
hermaphroditic porn . starlets with both organs . you should see the box : beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame .
you want to stick around here , sailor ? see if we can get some work ?
not in houston . we 'd be better off in some place more out of the way .
good god ... they 're meat eaters , roy , just drop the shit in there !
i ca n't ... they prefer a more formal presentation . i do n't usually go so close to the surface , but i was ...
you know goddamn well what i 've been doing -- i 've been sitting here suffering . i need my pills .
poor dear ... let 's get you back in bed and i 'll get them for you .
mostly . it must be my face . my mother always said i looked like a priest .
i better go check on my father . thanks for the pizza . i owe you one . maybe when he gets better , you know , when we 're done with all this .
`` ay pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . ''
`` oh then , dear saint , let lips do what hands to : they pray : grant thou , lest faith turn to despair . ''
well ... the thing is , nobody remembers their infancy . and anyone who says they do is lying . we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life .
did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness ? that darkness is part of their natural development .
i do n't know about that i do n't have any money i do n't have any attorneys gus is my only real friend .
i was n't talking about real friends . why does n't gus like me .
where are we going ? you know i hate surprises .
a little business move i made . on my own . i think you 're gon na approve .
you were right about coming here . i 'm sorry for not thinking ...
no , it 's okay . believe me , there were plenty of times i did n't know what the hell was right .
no . it does n't work that way . men ca n't get pms . unfortunately .
i 'm staying here with you tonight . there 's no getting rid of me .
i 'll do what i can . it 's getting messy in there .
ernie , dump him in a cab . around the corner . tiffany , you help him . i 'll destroy his file and refund his money . and if anybody comes asking ... we 've never heard of douglas quaid .
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair .
oh , shut up ! you have n't even got your spats on .
it 's not me , beth . i swear . it ca n't be .
`` it 's not me , beth . it 's not me . it ca n't be . i 'm not doing anything . '' just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle .
it 's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model .
oh yes , yes . it has a little knob that turns ... a little knob ... it must be somewhere around here ... yes ... here ... i see ...
you see , my dear , the word has gone around .
as leader of all illegal activities in casablanca , i am an influential and respected man . it would not be worth my life to do anything for monsieur laszlo . you , however , are a different matter .
why do you say that , brother ? i had a shower this morning .
oh , he had a shower this morning . you trying to call me a liar ?
really ? what is that , an order , < u > private < /u > ?
you have to go with us . you ca n't walk back ...
i would n't do that if i was you .
shut up . it 's too damn hot . what do you know , anyway ?
we walked right passed him . he 's following us .
killaine 's not that sort of guy . he said no -- he meant no .
i swear to you , argon , if you do n't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one i ever build .
susan , i sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in . i ask that you keep in mind that i am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what i want .
there 's rumor in the village . some call it magic .
that 's mad . surely you do n't take their word ?
no , son . daddy and mommy will never get remarried .
boy , i bet you if mommy ever saw this she 'd remarried you .
they told me they do n't help out stalkers . look , maybe they 're right , it 's been a long time .
i got it -- you hire a private eye , fly him out there , he follows her around a couple days , she 'll never know a thing .
did you hear that mr. de santis ? everyone 's really crazy about dead cat .
yes they are , are n't they ? look , why do n't you take the rest of the night off , you look tired .
boss-man , what were you going on about last night : `` i am the law and i am the danish ... ''
i do n't know what i was saying . i totally phoned it in last night . i have n't been getting a lot of sleep lately ...
another free program off line . what 's his user s'posed to do -- ?
the users ... you really think they 're still there ?
simple math , buzz . two plus two does not equal three .
miles , i 've always been on the square with you .
well , no , we sort of skipped that part .
then you 're not married -- if you did n't say it , you did n't do it -- would n't you agree , your highness ?
oh , oliver , you 're so tolerant . time for a coffee before you rush off ?
delighted , betty -- that is if you do n't mind being seen with an older man .
hey , ziat , hurry up with the tea will ay !
work , work , work , that 's all do
jorge . you frightened me . what 's happening to you ?
it 's about time we spoke to each other , is n't it ?
shook me up . i mean that you knew her and everything --
i did n't know her . the body i took knew her . the man she met in the coffee shop this morning . i - uh - took him .
oh , jesus . i ca n't explain . it 's ... it 's . i do n't know how to help ! i have to save him and i do n't know how to help !
kirsty , i 'm sorry ... do n't understand . i ...
after three years she remembers what the guy drove ?
she remembers because it was her `` dream truck . '' wanted one just like it .
i swear to god if you lay one hand on her !
no ! you listen to me , if you 're not where i want you in fifteen minutes i 'll hollow her out . do you understand ?
you 're looking more worried now than when you `` decided to stop worrying '' ?
alright , i 'm worried about christmas . i wish i had n't told him i 'd be back ..
there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser soze so sate had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death .
but how - wait . you 're saying soze sent t us to kill someone ?
that 's not good enough . i want to make plans to see you .
let me get a pen out of my car . do you have something to write on ?
i did n't tell you because i did n't think it was important .
no , it just makes you doubly responsible does n't it ?
that was my first game of strip croquet , you know . i thank you .
you 're welcome . it 's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor 's swing set .
she was very sick and then she went mindless , miss .
we 'll see if we ca n't make her well , alma , you and i .
your mother will want to kiss me ? give me back my letters . that 's the breaks i get . it 's the mothers that are always grateful to me . here .
you 're a peculiar person . why the other day i pleaded with you not to send in that story and 
so , you study world events , little one . that 's good for a girl your age .
yeah , i study world events . five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch 's cleansings ... along with american school kids . you know hqw i studied that . i went to their funerals with my dad . i met their parents .
dwight chapin , nixon 's appointments chief -- he knew segretti in school . maybe i 'm crazy , but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense . what were the three theories ?
the burglary was done by cubans or democrats or republicans .
oh yeah , right-between the power mower and the weed killer .
dad i 'm kidding , you can have the room .
i wanted to ask you something , on account you 've been around so long .
shoot . they do n't call me the wizard for nothing .
you planning on going somewhere , eduardo ? you do n't like it here ? this is the best situation you 're going to have for a long , long time .
i am a legitimate business . fishing boats . tuna . check it out . tax records , everything --
all right . do n't worry , i 'll be right beside you .
what help will that do if something in there is n't dead ?
look after that suit , eh . barbara chose it for me .
right . er , you 're not going to keep calling her barbara , are you ?
objection . the witness has already stated that miss lawson left without an explanation .
mr. cardenas , i suggest you move on to another line of questioning .
chet wo n't know anything . we 'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it 's over .
knox , if you promise that this will be the end of it-
y-u-h-e-e-y-a-h. yu-hee-yah ... ? no way , busters use it in a sentence .
okay . y'all make sure and come back now , reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah .
you 're wasting your time , already been tried .
yeah , but you did n't have the scudster working on it , did you ?
i 've heard the arguments . like napoleon 's quote , `` there 's one thing you ca n't do with a bayonet , and that 's - sit on it . ''
that 's right , sir . and do n't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb . what if they start something ?
darling , i do n't care - really i do n't . sidney 'd had a secret crush on me for years , but nothing we do is his business -
but he could be reporting back to your brother , could n't he ?
suppose you run your business and let me run mine .
suppose we ask sam . maybe he 'd like to make a change .
that 's terrific . do n't be afraid to be demonstrative . you 're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke .
i am . i 'm really feeling pretty good . i have a much stronger sense of how far i 've come .
he 's harmless . he just sits around and looks at these tapes . what 's the big deal ?
so he 's got this catalogue of women touching themselves ? that does n't make you feel weird ?
i do n't make no bones about where i 'm going to spend eternity . i have always been wild and you know that . if you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is ?
i 'm glad you brought that up as to who you are . i have to know who is in my house .
but ed , we 're not even married . and you do n't have a job .
but < u > you < /u > do ! and anyway , i 've got tons of new scripts . and now that i have a track record , studios are bound to hire me !
yeah ! you stay away from that andy kaufman , if you know what 's good for you !
who is this ? tony clifton you -- you know damn straight who it is . tony clifton ! a name to respect . a name to fear . beer . gear . deer . ear .
and you got skye davidson . pretty big leagues for a first timer . do you even like movies ?
not particularly . weird , is n't it ? god i 'm rally up . do you feel anything yet , mac ?
go on . take your bath . i 'll beat it .
you would n't have a smoke on you , would you ?
i have . spent six months in vienna with professor freud - flat on my back - - then there were the mayo brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if i were n't such a coward , i 'd kill myself .
do n't talk like that . i 'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
mary clarence . goose . we 're completely self-supporting . like all convents . like yours .
oh , right . at my old place , we used to ... wash cars . groom dogs . so ... nice loom .
i have no control over that . ronnie and billy were right there . they 'll tell you exactly what happened .
well , back home they do n't know about fuckin ' control . that looks bad .
ai n't you got a little something for the infirm ?
i 'm a little short . i 'll catch you next time .
naturally . you think my fiance is a bum ? now i guess i 'll have to give it back .
wait a minute - lets not be hasty . after all , we do n't want to hurt poor osgood 's feelings .
i do n't know what to say to ya ! i guess i just wanted to say i 'll see ya ... or whatever .
thank you much ... and huh , bon voyage .
but he ai n't quite sure which plane he 's on , y'know what i mean ...
you been around , you 're smart , you 're professional , you know what it takes -- we want you to mature the kid .
i 'll pack my things and meet you downstairs .
and to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight ...
see . money do n't buy happiness . i must say , she 's taking it well .
i 'd kill him . him and that redfield woman . together . first one then the other . and then i 'd laugh .
no , mr. lounds . you 'll be just fine .
my back hurts , my skin . did i get burned ? i hope to god i 'm not burned .
but that 's my calling , my purpose , my raison d'etre . toons are supposed to make people laugh ... and believe me , those people needed a laugh .
and when they 're done laughin ' , they 're gon na call the cops . that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel !
no , really . what did i do that was so wrong ?
what do n't you do ? randal , sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable .
two men making love ... ? now tell me again ... < u > why < /u > is that disgusting ?
lisa , c'mon . one guy sticking his dick in another guy 's mouth ? it 's disgusting .
i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase . it 's going to get you into trouble .
well , you do n't have to get nasty about it .
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff . i owe him .
you 're the tom hardy i 've been reading about in the papers , right ? new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres .
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu ?
so i shall avenge my master 's death after all .
so how many miles do you think it is ?
i have no idea but it looks like a long way .
you keep slipping away . how do you do that ?
i was one of those silent , listening children . glued to the shadows .
no , woody , for the first time i am thinking clearly . you were right all along . i 'm not a space ranger . i 'm just a toy . a stupid little insignificant toy .
whoa , hey -- wait a minute . being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger .
and i planned getting you off the hangman 's deck --
and that 's why you both lead the gang . two of you went into that bank together , right ?
is the rest of the house as bad as this ?
the rest of the house is probably worse . when can you and i get started ?
right now you 're just browsing through time . choose the things you 'll be proud of . the things that last .
my children make me happy . i miss them so much . beth . scott and beth . i 'm going to name my daughter after you .
i do n't mean believe , like believing in a religion . i mean , do you believe it has power ? do you think it could heal a sick person ?
frankly , my dear , i did n't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl . what are you driving at ?
judge man . watch yourself . sabu 's got juice now .
you do n't even know it man , but you 're a god damn hero .
does n't he look a whole of lot better ?
well , you look better than you did yesterday .
i have a passport . i 've got ... actually , it 's a little complicated .
< u > do you have your passport , sir < /u > ?
where are you ? patrick , what 's wrong ?
i do n't think i 'm gon na make it , jean .
no , you 'll be safe . we 're gon na pick him up again ...
and then what ? i 'll never be safe . i 'll have to leave the country ! you ca n't protect me , and you ca n't keep him in jail ! and you knew that all the goddamn time !
pretty good , mr. lundegaard . you 're damned hard to get on the phone .
yah , it 's pretty darned busy here , but that 's the way we like it .
he still has n't shown up . why are n't you in class ?
lit got canceled , so i stopped home and brought you some lunch .
you know how i feel . the world is random . the only certainty i believe in is death .
given all that 's happened , i understand . the world is random , but then there 's faith . where are you in death without it ?
you really are going to pakistan , then ? you are a stubborn man .
i 'm simply going to prove to muslims there , and hindus here , that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that 's where all our battles ought to be fought .
why , of course , hank -- i 've always got time for a neighbor . what 's on your mind ?
well -- here 's how it is ... tom sharp , eli higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it . what you think about it ?
with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal , whether it was nocturnal , what it ate , how it hunted , how big it was ... you are n't here for a lesson in dna .
no . i came to talk about dr. john whittlesley .
kee-rist , you sure are one twisty little bastard , ratso .
the name 's rico , at my own father 's grave , a man deserves some respect .
you did it , man ! you got us out ! next stop , new york city !
new york 's a long way 's off . let 's just keep moving , okay ?
whose funeral ? we 're doing all right . there has n't been a scab near the picket line for three days .
and you know why ? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two , three months . what 's it to them if the mine 's shut down a little longer ?
james , you said he was hiding in the barn ...
i think i saw a tv show like that when i was a kid . where a boy ...
but commander ... the negotiation ... you ... you ... you fired on him .
right . long live ... what 's your planet ?
oh , hey -- lem me give you a hand there .
thank you very much . are n't you a gentleman ? mr. ...
you see where tom miller 's playin ' the old farmer ?
he 's been playin ' old farmer nigh on sixty years .
what are you doing here in the trailer court , deputy ?
maybe i just live here , what do you think about that ?
i told you , the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult .
but why ? there must be some way to make her understand !
we 're not gon na be able to pump it !
alright . everybody grab your gear ! this ' is where we get off !
he only had a hundred an ' thirty . -- i think he 's good for the rest next week , mr. gazzo .
sure , rocky , bob 's good for it ...
i 'm a writer um ... teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet .
well this ought to be quite a change for you .
you 're not paying for this . it 's quite enough that you let me sit at your table .
i never pay for anything . they just keep me here to amuse the guests .
hey , you would n't believe this . two minutes ago , the knicks are ahead fourteen points , and now ... they 're ahead two points .
alvy , what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop ?
now i remember why i went into theoretical work . kent .
glad to have you , david . how 's the new office ?
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is . it 'll arrest the progress of his disease , and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies .
we 'll have to go into quarantine , maybe for quite a while .
what 's the matter ? we 're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we 're making dogshit .
a million dollars for our first run is not bad , george .
i ca n't believe we were fighting over a bad guy .
bad , yes . guy , no . this is one majorly beautiful evil person .
yes , but ... i thought , perhaps tonight , under the circumstances , i might ... stay here with you .
oh , darling ! do n't let 's spoil everything .
oh , my god ! i ca n't recognize the face , but the butt does look vaguely familiar .
do n't say that . you 'll embarrass frank .
how high up does this ... arms dealing go ?
bond . if someone wants you dead , it is renard . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .
that does n't mean shit . where do you come from , huh ? and i do n't mean indiana .
what do you want me to say ? my mother 's tummy ?
yeah , uh , i got some pretty good leads ...
liar ! you do n't care ! about anything .
well , you outranked < u > me < /u > , nikko .
yeah . and you used that . used < u > me < /u >
that 's the kind of emotion i was looking for in the first take .
well , are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion ? you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke .
they 're given to the living in memory of the dead . if this is a real one -- i ca n't be sure -- you can make a wish , and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye .
well , if it 's a real mourning ring , . i 'm going to think hard for something i want more than anything else in the world before i wish .
i still think we should send for a team of real scientists .
i am a scientist you asshole ! this could be the most important discovery in years . do you have any idea what a find like this could mean ?
but the good witch of the north told me not to .
very well ! throw that basket in the river and drown him !
sure , auggie , i got it . the store 's closed . and when do i tell them it 's open ?
when i tell you it 's open . it 's open when i tell you it 's open !
well , i , my most unabominable snowman , have been impressed by you . in fact i propose a pairing . so i 'm here to set you free .
an enticing offer . but what does the lady want in return ?
certainly , major mandrake . you 're a good officer , and you can ask me a question any time you want to .
well , general ripper , sir -- i was thinking -- we 're on a condition red , are n't we ?
what do you mean , it 's 'gone ' ? where has it gone , tommy ?
it 'll be here somewhere . i might have returned it by mistake .
chief , you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in ?
bork ! you are a federal agent . you represent the united states government ... never end a sentence with a preposition . try again .
you 're comin ' home , precious . santos ' gon na drive us to the san antonio airport .
mama , sailor 's in deep trouble here . i just ca n't leave him .
nobody knows you have anything to do with this case ; nothing has been on tv or the news ... why would he want to get in < u > your < /u > computer ?
because i 'm his damned pin-up girl ! his , all of them ! they know me . they 're in prisons with libraries , they collect clippings , i 'm their worthy opponent . you keep my name out of this .
theres nothing wrong with the line , sir . are you sure you have the right number ? is the number of a call box .
a call box ? thats odd . where exactly ?
whoa , you better cut a bigger hole than that .
hey , you promised ... ... do n't worry , i 'm wearing my girdle .
i had no idea it 's gotten that bad , sis .
oh , do n't feel sorry for me . please . no one 's forcing me to stay .
oh . it means that santa 's gon na fuck hanukkah 's shit up .
not if i can help it . you got any information for me ?
i 'm telling you , it was n't my fault !
you knocked the fucking casket over , for chrissakes !
okay , but what if it 's like foley said and she got knocked up , to trap you -- is it still your responsibility ?
no matter how it happened , if she goes ahead and has it '' zack , there 'll be a child in the world that 's mine -- and i could n't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived .
see , kids now are ten years ahead * of where we were at the same age . you probably think she 's still a virgin --
do n't be ridiculous . she 's only -- how old is she ?
ail right . by the way , his friend ... ?
the answer 's yes . i think . yes . i do n't know . where are they exactly ?
do n't worry about that . guys away from home , lonely , good-hearted women try to cheer them up .
it 's not that i did n't mean everything i wrote . it 's just that -- i thought you were dead . and now --
is it a gift for your wife ? are you getting a set together ?
no , i 'm not married . it 's for my daughter .
monday , with some of the boys from the office . mr. rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff . we run a picture magazine , you know -
i know . if you 're smart , you 'll talk to raymond . that 's the butler . you can learn a lot from him . he knows where the bodies are buried .
we do n't exactly know , sir . he wo n't give us him name . he appears to be the man who called in the report ... he 's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others .
he claims ? powell , has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists , pulling your chain ? or some kind of nut case who --
it 's beautiful , is n't it ? just like i knew it would be . he really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that !
well , come on , then . what are we waiting for ?
i do n't think you know dr. sheeler . she 's the other therapist here in town .
of course ... i 've heard great things about you .
so , what 's this sarah got that you do n't ? three tits ?
she 's from connecticut . she belongs to his stupid country club .
months of work , and the loom , absolutely ruined !
look , this is n't my kind of thing ! i was n't cut out to make little tapestries , or knit little sweaters ! i do n't do that ! i 'm a star !
the maid packed a suitcase . teresa ! teresa ?
i 'll get it . please , i do n't mind .
even he . hey , you could n't help me with an incredibly important decision , could you ?
this is important in comparison to , let 's say , whether they should cancel third world debt ?
arlyn and jane commited suicide . he said they commited suicide .
now there 's a picture i 'd like you to --
... small town . i suppose . you have to make your own fun .
everybody makes their own fun . f'you do n't make it yourself , it ai n't fun , it 's entertainment .
down there . did you ever loose track of him ?
well , let 's see -- there was that moment , when i had a train on top of my head --
what 's she doin ' runnin ' around the country at night .
i would n't know . did you ask her ?
for doting ; not for loving , pupil mine .
i pray thee , chde me not ; whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow ; the other did not so .
he broke because of me . i saw it . he lost all will to fight .
we must have alliance with england to prevail here . you achieved that ! you saved your family , increased your lands ! in time you will have all the power in scotland ! ... yet you grieve .
it was perfect . the harder i pushed , the more you pulled away .
you lied to me my whole life . everything you said , everything you did .
i hope you have patience with me . i do not know how to dance the quadrille but , if you desire it , i will learn .
i only desire what gives you pleasure , my dearest .
tell me . has black peter already crossed off a few bad children ?
the fat man on cherry street . the other fat man , mr. bulldozer . the trumpet player . that leaves two .

i do n't think so . it 's your script . it 's your show . good luck .
hey , love will make you do fucked-up things .
you said it , mister . i got ta go .
you 're delusional . maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood . and the severed arm ... well i do n't see it and ... maybe this is all in your head .
it took me an hour to clean it up . that was not in my head !
i ca n't believe it . no tracks , no sign , no spoor .
yeah , whatever they are , you 'd think after they ate all those sheep they 'd have to take a dump someplace ... what the hell 's going on in town ?
mr. appleton , you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the united states congress . believe you me , you do not want to incur our wrath .
i 'm sorry , sir , i have no intention of making light of this committee . and i have no intention of incurring your wrath , mr. chairman . i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath . they 've sent me letters from jail .
an erection , huh ? have n't had one of those in a while .
tell me about it . scared me at first . then , before i could figure out what to do with it , it was gone . imagine my disappointment .
do n't panic , now , there 's no rush ...
we ca n't leave it in there , it 's got all our accounts , everything that can nail us to a goddam cross ! ! !
do you and michael ever talk about his work ... ? about spending so much time working in the water ?
usually it 's all he talks about ... you must n't worry ... .
i would have figured you an r.n . by now , or , maybe med school .
i prefer to stay in the less frivolous professions .
our love will grow , dear , year by year ...
bye ! write me ! i 'm gon na kill you guys !
what did you want me to do with it ? they were all over the house .
are you fucking nuts ? that was forty , fifty thousand . i need it . i was depending on that money .
oh , okay . so ... how are you feeling ?
happy ? oh , you mean like , physically . i 'm good . look , i have a snooze button now !
you know how it is today ... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution .
thank you , anna . i 'll dry it up here when i wash it next . i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear .
never to pretend to know more than i did .
can you name all the members of the cabinet ?
it 's not much money , but it 's enough to live on . you 'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room .
maybe the romaris might have a room . they seem nice .
it 's possible . i do n't know about that .
i suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area ?
hey , willie -- i think you better get out now .
stark naked ? you wish ... if you 're trying to seduce me , dr. jones , this is a very primitive approach .
she 'll be with you soon . they 're pulling up . they 'll realize i kept my part of the bargain .
she 'll never be the same . none of us will .
guidance and assistance ! that 's insane ! doc , ya got ta help me .
i 'm sorry , but i ca n't keep you here .

his hands reach out and choke me all the time he mumbles slowly . truth ... truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold .
oh , have n't i ? the money -- mrs. lampert -- the money . the $ 250,000 charles voss received from the auction . those three men want it , too -- they want it very badly .
but it 's charles 's money , not theirs .
you may think you know what 's going on , but you do n't .
that 's what your father said . you 're telling me he 's in back of this whole thing ?
so mr. coffee , what went down outside the prison ?
oh , not much . mario brothers want me to do a job .
just tell me the truth . i 'm not the police . i do n't care what you 've done . i 'm not going to hurt you , but one way or another i 'm going to know .
you wo n't go to the police if i tell you ?
we 've got to have a talk , you and me .
all right , but later . i 've got a meeting now .
if he really loves you , you wo n't have to tell him anything . snap out of it ! would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here ?
i killed her . i 'm responsible . oh- h ... what can i do now ? how can i ever face him ? oh , i hope he never comes back !
you got yourself a < u > wife < /u > , sonny !

yeah , i guess you 're right . it 's just ... all so sudden ...
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years ?
the king 's stinking son fired me . and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject . while you 're at it , why do n't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it ? we 're closed !
can we talk about this ? can you just try to calm down ?
your goddamned friend , he thinks the only reason i 'm with you is for the money .
$ an acre , that 's what i paid ole , wo n't take a dime less . you got no choice on that .
did n't say i was buyin ' did i ? what you want down ? just bein ' curious , is all .
you know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them .
dr. jones , in our country a guest does not usually insult his host .
you 'll be fine . i 'm going to lose you .
ethan , you take care of yourself , i 'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove , i 'm gon na bail - and without giving two week notice .
oh , and but one word with one of us ? couple it with something . make it a word and a ... a blow .
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir . and you will give me occasion .
the tribe is concerned that many of your ... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues .

i never asked them about watergate . i only said what were hunt 's duties at the white house . they volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty .
i think we got a white house consultant linked to the bugging .
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas .
disrupt our brain waves , interfere with our ability to think .
are you < u > alright < /u > ... ?
i almost shot the < u > baby < /u > ...
the cryo unit leaked . the computers sealed the room . no airborne viruses no hazardous materials . i 've shut down the until . alright , stand back .
hold your breath . initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious .

georgie , what 's with the stag footage ? ? you said you were cutting in < u > establishing shots < /u > !
i did . i established some tits and ass .
what ? how long have you been standing there ?
did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade ?
oh , do give him here ! he needs to be comforted and held !
he needs to vent his outrage to the skies ! make yourself heard , willie ! learning to walk is not an easy thing ! why should it be so ?
sure it 's about you . but it 's about society , too .
oh man , i 'm gon na enjoy this one ... just remember , jack , you did this . you brought this on yourself ...
im afraid i have bad news , mr de moraes . i have reason to believe your brothers in trouble .
for your information , mr lombard , trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself . though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that .
paul , do n't you think it 's time for you to start writing again ? it 's been over a week .
i do n't know , it 's weird , but a couple of broken bones has n't done a lot for my creative juices . get the fuck out of here .

if you do n't believe me , let 's watch this movie . see if his name 's on it . how about it , harry ? can i watch my damn movie ?
i told you . i do n't turn on the tv except for the fights .
well , nobody can say we did n't try .
okay , here 's what i think . we find out what all the subway stops for that train are -- the subway system 's really not that big in rome , we could narrow it down and --
how come ben ca n't turn it on and off like us ?
that 's what we 're here to find out .
i know it 's busted . what did i just tell you ?
well , you know so much why do n't you just fix it yourself ?
where 's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing ?
i ca n't hear a word you 're saying !
can you describe her ? how old was she ?
i never met the woman . i 'm just taking care of the place until they sell it .
no one 's ever stood up to my brother the way you did .
but you did n't do much about it , susie . you walked out , and there i was ... solo ... and not too good at that .
good . real horrorshow . initiative comes to them as waits . i 've taught you much , my little droogies . now tell me what you have in mind , georgie boy .
oh , the old moloko-plus first , would you not say
hurray for us . did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated ? no , you would n't say that . they do n't count .
you 'd better try to get some sleep , bob .
i sabotaged it ? you 're the one who lost him , remember ?
well , i might 've found him again if i had n't left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you .
there 's the spirit , lad . if ye run into trouble , give a yank here and we 'll haul ye up .
what 's left of me ... how do i recognize the armor of achilles ?
i think i may just go on to the reservation .
tom , i 'm this close to coming with you ...
it wo n't even hold the one day , ronnie --
yes -- it will ... now : why is the president in china ?
do you have a history of emotional problems , mr. wigand ?
yes . yes , i do . yes , i get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox ... !
never mindi 'll get it myself . gigolo ? why , you took the word right out of my mouth . thanks .
he 's one of the best fliers in the country . right now he 's planning a trip to japan .
well , we did n't know that at the time .
we assaulted a federal agent . we killed him .
you been a bad girl , grace . you took my heart from your mama , did n't ya ? you betrayed her ! like you did me . there ai n't no forgivin ' ya , girl !
oh no ! oh please forgive me , papa !
when i grow up , i 'm going to go to mhravitch .
it 's rather a disappointment these days . it is n't there any more .
that 's okay , kelly . you 're doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?
no . i 've done it a couple of times , i mean with guys i dated . but this hurt ... like , he was built ... you know ...
it 's just ... catching up with me , you know ?
well why do n't you sit this one and get some rest ... you look like shit . cut to int tubbs ' apartment - night
what is this ? i got work to do .
sit down and shut up , will ya . try not to live up to all my expectations . we were told you know a hustle artist named johnny hooker .
... i do n't really know you yet , sandy ... what do you like ? i mean , what kind of clothes do you like ? do you like blue ... red ?
oh , i like satin , i like pink ...
how the hell 'd you get the beans all the way up top like that ?
i do n't know . it 's not like it was a well thought-out plan .
i remember that night , you had like four daiquiris .
try four and a half . at first i totally did n't like him .
i knew this man . green berets , out of fort bragg . what the hell were they doing in here ? you got any answers for this , dillon ?
jesus ... this is inhuman . uh ... i was n't told of any operations in this area . they should n't have been here .
oh . well , what are you going to do ? you have to go to school , honey . i mean , what --
i 'm not coming back ! that 's it ! i want to go home !
your grades for fall semester . they 're -- good .
you came here to give me my report card ?
do n't give me six years ! you never divorced patty , did you ? so what 'd you expect from m.j. ?
she knows i 'm catholic ! she never mentioned divorce ! not once !
can you walk ? are your legs working ... ?
< u > perhaps < /u > ... shall we < u > see < /u > ... ?
wait a minute , you thinkin ' of getting in bed with the cowboys ?
business is business . do n't have to love 'em to work with 'em . not if there 's money in it .
is chopping firewood in the back garden . honora approaches him .
i 've just had hilda hulme on the phone .
and it 's too late to shut it down ?
i 'm afraid so . the crash did too much damage . the overload is inevitable , at this point .
rhah ! what 's going on . rodriguez 's hole just got ...
okay , here it is - one , we got gooks in the fuckin ' perimeter .
are you telling me my husband is a bigamist ? ? ?
i 'm telling you he 's not your husband at all .
no , i do n't . i 'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all .
eduard did n't see it as something that needed bearing .
i spent all day crawling out of a grave . the costumer kept bitching 'cause i was ripping my nylons -
ripped nylons work . makes the shot more real .
jabez stone -- did you or did you not sign this document ?
yes , i did -- but you tricked me into signing it ! you told me my soul was nothing ... that i could forget all about a soul , in exchange for money . that was a lie , a lie , a lie .
in the brain , i tell you . i know .
you do n't know and you 'll never know or understand , toddy . not from me or from knox would you learn those things . look --
by gosh , them stiffs are get- tin ' heavier and more of 'em every day . they even got the coroner working overtime .
yeah , between the gangsters and the autos , we wo n't need another war to carry off the population .
yes , sir , as a final note , i 'd like to say , fuck our orders , fuck ramelle , fuck the cheese capital of france and while we 're at it , fuck private james ryan .
i 'll make a note of your suggestions but i 'll leave that last one to you , especially if he 's already dead .
i do n't think that 's a good idea , lenny .
i just got to talk to you for one second .
who 'd pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists .
they would n't deal with a guy like jack . who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ?
that does n't matter , sir . you 're the important one .
awfully nice of you to say . of course i intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree .
thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment , thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens . do you know what you are ?
do n't call me a bum ! i ai n't no bum !
he is only curious to know who you are .
if his love were like mine , he would not permit you to come here .
i 'd just like to pick up a few of my things
i do n't believe you have `` things . ''
oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance .
that would be devil 's needle . last landmark i know in these woods .
then why does he stay ? my scouts say he has not advanced .
he waits . for you . he says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him .
it 's the rules and i got ta follow 'em . no visitin ' 'cept holidays and sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime .
you mean to tell me i ca n't see my own husband ?
there are a few other points we should discuss . the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature , and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill in giving her signature .
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship 's freewill ? are you serious ?
forgive me . we all have patriotic feelings of some kind .
two thousand , two hundred florins is all i need a hundred ? fifty ?
say , look ! i did n't know it was anything like this , seeand
what 's the matter with you ! gettin ' yellow ?
all right youre the super sleuth , what do you want , a medal ?
no . but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me , and im a busy man .
what are we promising him ? what can we possibly give him ?
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes .
i did n't cook up a story . i had a source .
someone reliable , i 'm sure . a booze- hound in a bar ?
whatever . i still have n't received simone 's script notes .
there are n't any . if the filmmakers are happy , simone 's happy . she considers herself an ... `` instrument '' .
do n't you feel anything for me at all any more ?
it takes so many things to make love last . most of all it takes respect . and i ca n't live with a man i do n't respect !
oh . elena wanted to know when we could expect you on thanksgiving . it 's just going to be you this year .
ben , i 'm going to florida . i hate thanksgiving and i hate the cold . i have a new nurse . she 's a negro , she weighs three hundred pounds , and i 've decided to leave my entire estate to her .
i think he has a little thing for annie .
oh , no , no , that 's bullshit , max . he goes with that girl over there .
but if something should ... god forbid ... go wrong , at least we could give them some of their money back . it would look better in court .
stop talking like that , you white mouse ! nothing 's going to go wrong . as a matter of fact , today i have taken steps to insure total disaster . at two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than roger de bris .
do you realize what we 're involved in here now ?
i do n't care . i need my hat . i wo n't go without it .
well , i 've been thinking ... i did n't realize how much ... talent walter actually had . it would be wrong for us to show them one at a time . dead wrong .
you 're right . we should build a collection first .
i 'm not paying this back . i consider it `` asshole tax . ''
yes , fine . just , get on . stay away a couple of weeks , at least .
you oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president , after all .
he is a bolshevik . he will have us at war by the end of the year . i think i 'm going to run that wheelchair picture .
since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the japanese ?
since armitage sold them a program on it . put them years ahead of the competition .
you 're staying here . some of them might not come after me . if they do n't this place is gon na turn into a total stain .
you say that like it 's a bad thing .
so who 's the guv ? who we doing this for ?
you 're doing it for me is all you need to know . you only know that because you need to know .
i-i read a poem of you and thought of his last week . a poem of his and thought of you last -- you 'll be fine , though . lee walks over to elliot in the center aisle . she looks at the book .
uh , uh , this is great . i mean , i love e.e . cummings , but i ca n't let you get this .
it 'll pass . headaches are like resolutions ... you forget them soon as they stop hurting .
you got aspirins ? i have something ... not aspirins , but my mother 's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding . teddy was furious when he found out i 'd taken tranquilizers !
heather , this is sara risher over at new line . how are you ?
oh , hi . i 'm fine , sara . my god , a voice from the past !
that 's got nothing to do with it ... you 're so beyond my comprehension i ca n't even discuss it with you .
then do n't ... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you 're gon na do .
you do n't believe me ? look in the garage .
sure we believe you , only now we want you to believe us . that car better be back here by noon tomorrow , or there 's going to be fireworks .
there is no masbath here . my father 's loan papers are missing .
there are none for magistrate philipse either . `` paasch , james '' `` pieter , thomas '' `` pos , william . ''
oh sure yes , that 's fine , late dinners are good . should i get dressed up or -- ?
no , no , just casual maybe , maybe i thought -- there 's a spot i like to go , it 's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
we 're the guys who clean up after the parade .
i 'm gon na stick this right in your eye .
you might want to pass it along to mac .
listen to me , johnny . come in ! you 're out there all alone ... we 're getting close ... real close ... maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
paulie 's been a little sick all winter ... he was home .
how many times did he stay home the last couple of months ?
what you do is no business of mine . live and let live , i say .
i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today ?
could i ask you to move ? i 'm sorry - but when you turn , the sheets , i ca n't really bear the sheets moving over me . sorry .
yes , of course , i 'm so sorry . stupid of me . hana gets up , upset to have hurt him .
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure .
what a cold description ... for such a beautiful gift .
um , kimberly ? this is a neighborhood . you may wan na slow it down .
do n't worry . nothing can happen to us .
i just went upstairs to see this man lacerda . i told him i knew what he was up to ... he says he 's a photographer ! but when i mentioned savage henry he freaked ! he knows we 're onto him !
but what about our room ? and the golf shoes ?
fourteen . we finally got him a room upstairs . should be up there in a couple of hours .
what do you do , just have someone follow him around with a defribilator ?
if you 're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty , forget it .
sorry , bill , have a drink , eat your cake , blow out the candles and make a wish . talk to you monday . okay ?
you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose ?
you do n't move soon . i 'll begin to decompose .
what , and i care ? remember , you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son 's life .
and you do have a reputation , so i 'll choose my words carefully . but not to put too fine a point on it , fuck yourself , harry !
now i remember why i have n't gone anywhere in months . i 'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there . i might as well be from another planet .
we just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who is n't a total idiot , that 's all .
look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?
and is n't there a movie in the works about you ?
even when you say the things , there 's always more things .
right now , i 'm more worried about my mother than anything . they wo n't let her see my father .
i see you as a young meg ryan myself .
thanks , dewey . but with my luck they 'd cast tori spelling .
you really did n't have to come , you know . i 'd have brought them straight t ...
who in the world < u > is < /u > he ?
let me go ! i 'm the one he wants . this is all happening because of me . if i turn myself in ...
he 's just finding another reason for bumpin ' us off . do n't ya see . he needs us ta die . he needs our bodies .
that 's their job , is n't it ? to argue . so , i think my case will be long on talk and short on action .
i am prepared to write anything you tell me .
i 'm going to florida , that 's my only chance .
you know what 's wrong with you ? you got fevers . you kinky as a bedbug . how you gon na get to florida ?
if he 's dead , verbal - if what you say is true , then it wo n't matter . it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york , was n't it ? tell me the truth .
it was all keaton . we followed him from the beginning .
oh come on , kathryn , it was just a contest .
at first it was , but now it 's become something bigger .
... fine . ill go for the safe place .
have the money ready by 11am . well call you .
hey , i thought i was n't your type .
wichita -- you 're everybody 's type . but seriously , do n't worry about it . i get my occasional crushes .
you 're crazy . she 's ed 's girl friend .
does n't hurt to ask . sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest .
but going in that church , i 'd be stooling for you , charley . you make a pigeon out of me .
let me explain you something , kid . stooling is when you rat on your friends , on the guys you 're with . when johnny needs a favor , do n't try to figure it out , just do it . now go ahead , join the congregation .
real , my ass . it 's an overblown game . anybody ever catch that fucking psycho ?
before you , nobody else had gotten close enough to sid to take a shot at him . hell , nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first . new scar  you making it okay in there ?
i do n't know what the fuck you 're doin ' . you 're givin ' us a ride .
what do i look like , al cowlins ? you want to take my car , drop her off ?
you know , we 're okay . they 're not finding us . you 'll remember me in the morning . and you 'll come to me and tell me about us and we 'll start over .
i loved you so much this day . on my bed in your panties . i remember i thought , how impossibly lucky am i to have you on my bed in your panties .
hammer , the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands .
i know sir . i wo n't let you down .
please do n't . not tonight . i 'm not up for it . they always stay till mornin ' . i 'm just give out , doyle .
you do n't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low .
god , this is so corny . have we been reduced to this ? sheets ?
think of them as death shrouds . and the moaning is important . really < u > moan < /u > ! practice , practice , practice .
yeah . i was going to kill him from the inside .
and yourself too in the process . god , you 're so beautiful . why could n't i see that before ?
but no short-arm inspection . i 'm with you there .
screw it . we been earning our keep as respectable knife artists . why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle ?
organize a search party . i want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system .
you do n't have the authority to do that .
i ca n't believe the captain went along with a memory download .
captain picard agrees that the b-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself . if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix , he should have all my abilities .
yah , yah , course i remember . how are ya ? what time is it ?
oh , geez . it 's quarter to eleven . i hope i dint wake you .
i 'm just curious . i can never tell what women think is handsome . is he handsome ?
well . he 's probably rugged handsome i guess . yeah .
if prince albert were here today , he 'd tell him a thing or two .
sir henry is not alone . they all wish it . the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank --
and besides , when you say i make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal .
you could n't be a criminal if you committed a major crime .
i 'm going ... i am ... i 'm going to be sick .
no you 're not . how ... nice one . how dumb do you think i am ?
they want to be with you luke , they go to your house to be with their father .
jackie , they come to be part of my life . rachel < u > is < /u > part of that life .
soon as i 'm back , i 'm gon na trade that in for a bigger rock .
i do n't care about rocks , i care about < u > you < /u > . you bring him back in one piece , or you can forget being best man .
and you know why ? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two , three months . what 's it to them if the mine 's shut down a little longer ?
it 's a lot to them . they 'd do anything to open that mine .
could you take her up right now , king ? other- wise we 'll get kind of close to the fireball .
sure , i 'll take her up right now .
a monster ? but he built this for the woman he loved , like the taj mahal .
the taj mahal was n't a palace , it was a tomb . why did n't he tell us ?
well , we sure as hell are n't going home just because the enemy tells us to .
wait a minute , major . `` ope , '' that 's the recall code . where would they get that ?
the fact is , that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up .
cleaned up ? it ca n't be cleaned up ! without the nanobot the waste ca n't be stabilized ! that 's what we 've been trying to tell you ! the only thing we can do is run ! run ! run !
yes . yes , well do n't think about it too long , just say the first thing that pops into your mind .
right ... knickers ... cabbages ... it does n't have a beak . alex laughs . slide of woman speaking to boy .
now what can i do you for , mister french ?
how can i lay hold a the soggy bottom boys ?
tell me what you saw tonight . tell me .
. i saw you come in , talk on the phone . get undressed .
that 's the best i can do . ... but minute-by-minute , i find myself lingering .
... i just saw my doctor , he told me everything was fine .
i fought for my country . it was my choice .
and now , what do you choose to do ?
i would say it sounds like you 're trying to get me into bed .
if that 's a potential you see yourself fulfilling ... i mean ... my , i sound a bit --
this is hard for me . but i got to do it . two things i got to say to you . i 'm a take the easy one first .
if it 's hard for you , might kill me dead .
they 're gon na kill her , walter , and then they 're gon na kill me --
well that 's just , that 's the stress talking , dude . so far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes --
-- who ? -- who else is here ? --
-- no ! -- not me ! -- no other people ! --
so , mr. besserman , same slot tomorrow ... ?
eh , i dunno ... andy . i 'm ... thinkin ' of letting you go ...
you mean you 'd like me to do it , huh ?
well , i was thinking thatyeah , you know , sort of break the ice .
i just do n't want anyone to know it 's me .
that 's fine . can i have a telephone number , area code first on where we can call you back ?
are you crazy , you 'll get stung ! !
you 're right , let 's knock it down .
hi . you - you wan na get some breakfast ... ? maybe see a movie ... ?
i - i ... i ca n't , michael . there 's stuff -- - at the clinic -
you ca n't do this , he 's human , it 's murder .
it 's war , now get the fuck out of the way !
then , you tell me what you think we 're doing .
all we do is pick up the pieces . we take all the evidence , and all the pictures and samples . we write everything down and note what time things happened ...
years ? there are going to be lots of ... opportunities .
gale ... you 're a very nice person . i would n't want to hurt you ... in any way ...
helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families .
i just checked myself . they 're being issued identity cards . call comes , and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas . they go by helicopter to mount weather . we meet them there .
what ? let paris hold its plane ? let memphis take care of it ? let somebody down the line clean up your mess ?
every person counts , every package counts , that 's my point .
mom , not now ! i , i do n't know what to do..
yes , you do . you have to go rescue all those people ...
i know you are . very serious ... most of the time these days .
now what does that mean ? my daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed , and i 'm supposed to think it 's amusing ? that tie 's god-awful . why do you wear it ?
is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan ?
perhaps it wasnt so brave of him . had i been here i just might have given him his money , mr lombard . one can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct , as someone in your line of work ought to know .
but i 'm david ... i mean , i 'm not david , but she thinks i am ! you heard her ... stop staring at me ... i 'm not crazy , she is !
why are you screaming at me ? i mean , what am i ... why am i here ? i do n't ...
you have to excuse me , mr. boone . since my stroke , i am often overcome with nostalgia .
i do n't mind . i 'm not crazy about my old man either .
put in the coordinates and let 's get a visual . the visuals are n't coming up .
the satellite does n't work as fast as i do .
you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency . why ?
according to the newspaper , fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus . are you familiar with the hanta virus , agent mulder ?
actually it 's a nightmare . i 've been desperate for a shag , but watching him suffer was just too much fun . you should try it with tommy .
what , and deny myself the only pleasure i get from him ? did i tell you about my birthday ?
ten , sir , and make them short ones , do you hear , captain grogan ?
do n't bully , mr. best . here are the pistols . god bless you , my boy ; and when i count three , fire .
he was in a 4g negative dive and you were on his six ?
yes , ma'am , at first . then i was directly above him .
what do you want from me ? i was reassigned . i 'm out .
see , that 's a problem for me , nicky . whatever he 's doing , we need to end it . this is n't the kind of mess you walk away from .
jeff , if you 're squeamish , just do n't look .
now hold on . i 'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but i do n't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
what 's there to do at the point ? god , lisa , we 've been going together almost two years , and ...
brad . i do n't want to have to use sex as a tool .
i do n't see how that plan 's any better .
someone 's got to send the gold up . it ca n't get on the line by itself .
about as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave . good to see you , son . did you bring any of that yankee whisky with you ?
it is n't yankee whisky , daddy , it 's scotch .
well , now there 's something worth dying for . what do you think ?
hmmm ... she 's beneath me , i 'm afraid .
you 're looking very chipper this morning , rose . sow do you feel ?
perfect , wonderful , good as i ever felt ! except for a big old scar on my stummick , i would n't even know i been in the hospital .
not that kind ... you men and your egos .
never mind my ego . let 's talk about mary .
you 're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you 're hoping that 'll turn into something else .
i would n't mind doin ' something else , but i do really have to pee .
the shield is down ! commence attack on thedeath star 's main reactor .
we 're on our way . red group , gold group , all fighters follow me . told you they 'd do it !
i guess he 's pretty , uh , racially pretty cool --
they 're not his , heh-heh , they 're not literally his children ; they 're the little lebowski urban achievers , inner-city children of promise but without the --
i like to think that i 'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene .
no doubt , brother - i figured as much back there in the restaurant . that 's why i invited you out here for this advanced tutorial .
you have to help me . you will understand . and no , you 're not dreaming . do you know where we are ?
it 's ... i do n't know . first world war , right ?
did you hurt yourself ? whatd'ya do ? step on a thumbtack ?
clarence , i 've got something to tell you . i did n't just happen to be at the theater . i was paid to be there .
curtis is always more complicated than he seems . even now .
and so , on this , the most solemn day of the jewish year , a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
i know what it is . i just ca n't believe what i 'm hearing . what has she talked you into ?
nothing . they 're my patients . it 's my decision . i want the dreams stopped until we get some answers .
right up there over the vice- president 's chair -- the four in the front row represent the four big news services . you 've met the press bunch , have n't you ?
oh , yes -- they 're fine people -- regular people .
look , you took one road and i took another . that 's fine .
is it gerry ? 'cause i do n't think it 's fine with you . give him time to figure out what he wants .
oh , it 's you , gray . well , come in . sit down . have a glass with me .
you 're uncommon friendly tonight , toddy . more like the old days .
what is there to say ? they know what john bontecou is -- and if they did n't , they know now .
yes , you made your feeling abun- dantly clear . now they want to do the same with theirs .

i had n't forgotten . i ordered some cloth but it did n't come in and i felt so bad if i would have come to her birthday without that , i just stayed at home .
the club 's so < u > stuffy < /u > . i want to try someplace different .
there is n't anyplace else -- except the worker bar .
so all this ... really was because of that soap opera ? my son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor ? a fake doctor ?

okay , and listen , i would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life .
really , mr. clurman , you do n't have to sell me .
forgive my indulgence . seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy . the point is , mr. odets here has written a wonderful play . most of the roles are cast , but we have n't found our female lead ...
you have n't slept with her , have you ?
that is a cheap question and the answer is , of course , no comment .

it 's a lousy job , but - the only reason i stay is for the health benefits .
was he morose , or ... ? i mean ...

it 's hard to believe ... a great looking girl like you all alone like this . as she glances up at him , she is first flustered , then flattered , then ... finally ... just realistic :
listen , are you sure you should n't do something about the bridge ?
so , what do you think we should do ?
i thought i might , you know , nip it in the bud before it gets worse . because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant .
i 've been trapped by miles kastle my whole life . she walks over to her scooter , and mounts it .
now he 's the one who 's locked up and i 'm the one who 's free . if i got ta do this alone , i might as well start now . she revs up and peals out .

i just listened ... and believed everything they told me . 'she stole the money . ' 'we do n't want to get her in trouble . ' 'no do n't bring the police in ' ...
it was her boss ' idea not to report it to the police ?
that stinks . they left you with absolutely nothing . it makes you wonder about the entire legal system . like rodney king .
they bought her speech . if i was only in it for rex 's money , he should n't have to give me any .
i wanted to talk a little bit about school , if i could ...
school . school is no problem . all you have to do is go to get the grades . and if you know something , all you have to do is go about half the time .

i will admit ... there are times when i wish i had an emotion chip i could turn on and off .
what i know , you 'll have to find out on your own .
liddy -- you think there 's a chance he 'll talk ?

donnie , i 'm afraid i ca n't continue this conversation . i could lose my job .
eight words back in '72 -- `` i covered up . i was wrong . i 'm sorry '' -- and the american public would 've forgiven him . but we never opened our mouths , john . we failed him .
dick nixon saying `` i 'm sorry '' ? that 'll be the day . the whole suit of armor 'd fall off .
he pushed into me ... i could n't stop him ... it hurt .
i 'm sorry ... you said it hurt ? why ?
was it bosnia ? i forget ... it 's so sad , the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy . a soul/funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention . she goes over and turns it up .

small , blond , good-looking . she was with him when we met . she had a funny english accent .
oh . thatd be rhian , a welsh chick he used to lay at weekends . she got wise and dumped him months ago ...
not necessary , but preferable . i do n't think he 'll be a bother , he seems like a most refreshing sort of man .
yes , he is different ... not the kind of person one usually meets in washington .
do n't talk to them anymore . sal and me are getting a jet , we 're going to algeria - i 'll write you from there .
he was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... algeria ?
torrio ai n't like them guys . he thinks like an american . you 'd like him , charlie . he 'd like you .

lula , he mighta did , i do n't know . but it do n't matter now . lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ai n't their fault .
maybe these are not men - not like us .
everything human do n't have to look like you and me ... .
i do n't know what you 're talking about , man . even if i did , i 'm not so crazy i 'm gon na cross zimmermann .

missiles ! sixty miles off , heading in fast . steady track , they look like beam riders .
roger , keep calling them . knock off auto-pilot , ace .

i could n't stay in this place . i would n't . i 'd just pick up , do whatever i had to do , and get out .

i 'm lookin ' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap . thought he mighta come in here .

i do not recollect , your majesty . will that be all ?
yes , general formica . carry on , my good man ! i do n't know what we would do without you .
i 'm a good woman to you , doc . do n't i always take care of you ? nobody cares for you like me . i 'm a good woman .
yes , i know . you are a good woman .
oh , please do n't make fun of me , mr , valiant . you do n't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way i do .
yeah , well , you do n't know how hard it is bein ' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do .
it 's a convent . all you have to do is shut up , behave yourself , and get along .
with nuns ? with rulers ? no way . i 'm gon na go back , work things out with vince .
what ? now i 'm working the drop car ? who 's handling the scene here ?
cole and munoz . i 'm uh ... letting them run with the ball for a while .
it 's no accident we stumbled on this money . it 's an answer to a prayer ! every night and every day i 've prayed that god would just -- help me out a little , give me a little push . tonight my prayer came true .
oh so god 's like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks ?
i do n't know . i just did n't wan na win like this .
you stop right there . you are a good person . good things happen to good people .
& quot ; in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon ... & quot ;
& quot ; and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon ... & quot ;
if that 's not a drop or a pickup , i 'll open a charge for you at bloomingdale 's .
make it alexander 's , i like the toy department .
oh . hi . i work in your office . i was on the junket to the conference . i 'm --
i know who y6u are . you 're dorothy boyd . you 're in ... wait ... you 're in accounts . you have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of albert einstein morphed onto shaquille neal 's body .
okay , newsman . how much you make a week ? you 're not talkin ' . you payin ' me ? what have you got for me ? we 're givin ' you entertainment ... what are you givin ' us ?
what do you want us to give you ? you want to be paid for ...
that reminds me , if we could scrape up enough for a film chain , i 've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin ' new movies on the street before they 're even in the theater .
a 35mm film chain ... i 'll see what i can do ... .
your neighbor -- udall -- is taking care of him .
how could you do that ? he 'll hurt him .
all right . these are the choices : microwave ovens , pocket calculators , walkmans , digital watches and miniature tv 's .
oh . and huge portable radios . everything else gets small , but for some reason , portable radios get enormous .
i have walked my way since the beginning of time . sometimes i give , sometimes i take . it is mine to know which , and when .
dumb riddles , merlin . i am your king .
nothing . hard day . gon na have a drink .
i 'll make it . i 'm so happy , nathan ! everything 's going to be so great ! scotch on the rocks , right ? just kidding . i know what you drink , mister . i know what you drink . voila !
there is one other thing you should know about me .
nothing you could say would change the way i feel .
but maybe we 're the ones who should be down there . doing something . making it better .
ca n't be done . that place already died and gone to hell .
mr. august , i 'm not at all sure -
look . do n't say a word . i 've taken an interest in you and i 'm willin ' to put up my time to help you . besides , i think i know where to find your sister .
it is broad day ! the rooster tells us so !
it was the owl . believe me , love , it was the owl .
johnnie ... that 's the past ... we got ta get on to our future , sugar !
all i have to do is grab my suitcase , and i 'm ready . you 're lucky cause i happen to love night drivin ' .
it 's not your friend . it keeps you sucking . remem- ber the old bum 's lungs ?
i remember the old bastard 's liver ! i do n't believe you did that . i had a great sent- imental attachment to that .
no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ?
all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .
even if it 's all true - that does n't make you a witch ! it 's , rowan !
but it scares the hell out of you , does n't it . michael ... ?
but they 'd still get the idea , right ?
you 'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop . maybe some audio , too . to tie it all in to gary . how long would that take you ?
it has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ?
by then it 's too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !
i wo n't stay long . i had to talk to someone .
you do n't usually talk to anyone when you 're hurting .
cranes ? who needs to walk like a crane ?
that 's just my interpretation . actually it 's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners . you see ? walk in a gently 'z ' . there are four distinct movements ...
well ... i have to take this over to debi .
here . take my card . wait a minute ... here 's a special one . for top-shelf clients .
real good , chet ... it 's been awhile .
everythin 's relative . where 's that marietta pace fortune ? you two did n't split up , i hope .
and probably never again . it 's nothing personal . it 's just ... i know a lot of pilots . maybe i 'm immune ...
do n't worry , i 'm a new strain . and i do n't give up . everything i 've ever wanted i 've had to work like hell for . well , how about it ?
look . i wan na tell you . i forgive you for everything . i know what you 've been going through . you 're just scared . i was scared , too , but i 'm not anymore .
how could you possibly know what i 've been going through ?
i mean ... wow ... off the charts great .
its an unbelievable thing . wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person . im gon na buy it ...
what do you want me to say , frank ? i was killing men when i was fifteen . i like getting shot at . i like riding out of town with a posse at my back . this is a helluva better life than farming .
a better life than the one you could have had with zee ?
it 's so far way . i could n't bear it .
kids do n't care . you 're thinking of yourself .
i ca n't do it even if he 's gone .
what 's the matter ? does he have a courtesy card from the police department ?
i suppose you know what you 're doing , but i wonder if you realize what this means ?
i do . we 've got plenty of time to discuss that later .
okay , joel . i suppose you 're right .
i had a good time last night . i really did .
but i think she wanted to be happy , that 's why she wrote . i mean , she was still writing about love , right ?
true . i guess she had n't completely given up hope . are you sure you 're seventeen ?
thank you for being kind enough to lie . you see , i 've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech . you 're hired . any questions ?
just one . why is this floor so short ?
sounds good . how do you know where i live ?
oh , i even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- i know when you were born -- and where -- i know all sorts of things about you .
you sure you feel up to it , nathan ?
yeah . i feel real up to it right now . come on , david lee , you and me 'll do the loading .
seems like he 's doing me a favor , then .
you 're missing the point . their vampire victims do n't die . they turn . they become carriers . if the reapers continue unchecked , there could be thousands of them before the month is over . do the math .
well , here we are back at fucking school again .
huh . st. bernard 's . figures it 's named after a canine .
yeah , we can . least till after this weekend . he ai n't going nowhere . we 'll deal with it then .
whatever , let 's just get the hellout of here .
indeed we are . we 'll continue the interrogation there .
i ai n't tellin ' you nothin ' ! get me santino .
he did ? i do n't remember . did he say about me ? in the trunk ?
he said he wished the two of you could start over , live a normal life .
well , shit-fire , kansas , that 's the sweetest goddamn thing ever ...
i know , but we ca n't quite figure out how to , y'know , do it .
yeah . i guess i did . what 's going to happen to me ?
we 're going to leave that up to detective williams . i 'll tell you though . you 're okay . you shot a real son of a bitch .
two people ca n't just be alone together in the world . at least not us ...
i ca n't do this . i ca n't leave you ...
let 's get out of here . we got another long drive ahead of us . ... the fuck where i do not know , but i know it 's gon na be long .
betty would never dress like that . she 's not some trailer park slut !
there 's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead .
i 'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you .
take your money ? this guy will blow up your house and everyone in it !
there 's just no way the mets will lose this game . gooden is pitching and strawberry is ready to break out .
i was lured by all the money and i truly did convince myself that what i did was for justice . since then , mccay has wanted to put anyone he can down here .
but how do you know if the people are guilty ?
well , it 's a terrific yard , chief , but the man 's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss .
does that bother you , bill ? i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute , she has to have bad eyesight .
that will not be necessary . you can simply speak to me . i understand most languages fluently .
yeah but the ship 's mainframe does n't . i need you to tell it something .
tell me . i could use someone up my alley .
i do n't get that . is that sexual ?
john even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into mrs. hallstrom 's milk .
finally . i was getting tired of watching him try every night .
dance with me . i want to touch you . i want the things which are mine . which belong to me .
do you think you 're the only one who feels anything ? is that what you think ?
you 're right . you know i was thinking that we should have maxine over for dinner . since you two are partners and all . it might be a nice gesture .
i do n't know . there 's some tension between us . i 'd hate to expose you to that .
it 's not that kind of a test . but you seem well on the way to a complete recovery .
and when do i get out of here then ?
she 's in l.a. , he 's in the bay area --
a five hundred foot thick steel wall . but the connection between these two electrons is so --
someone should check him out . maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over . he has one , he might have two .
you see that desk ? _your_ desk ? you see the crap piled up on it ?
yes , one gross of bullets , two dozen hand-grenades , three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches .
fine . we 'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery . by the way , how 're you fixed for spys ?
clouds , kid . we was lookin ' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin ' up our ass .
oh , them . hell , i seen them .
this is a convent , not a clinic . we offer moral guidance , not hardware .
have you been out in those streets ? do you know what those kids are up against ? you should help them !
you 're welcome . i was the one who cried .
was uncle sean ever bad ? did you ever spank him ?
if you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they 're blowing us up in two days , what would you do ?
that 's the stupidest question i 've ever heard .
contracts ? -- yes , they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that 's all right . without me and my money , they would n't have anything .
they 'd have a good neighbor , jabez -- and that 's worth much more than anything else -- much , much more !
you talked to your supervisor lately ? he 's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight . that on top of the cops bugging him .
i 'll take care of that corey , but i need this now .
so you want a financial , is he a deadbeat , we can do a d & b --
no , no , no , it 's more like , who is he , does he have a sense of humor , is he nice -- no forget nice , i 've got nice --
mom - i got it all worked out ; it 's over . the best thing is you go home . watch it on tv .
i talked to the fbi , i told them about you , they said if you just come outta the bank it 's gon na be okay .
it 's all bullshit . i swear . it 's nothing . whatever you want , we 'll do .
the truth was , that no matter how bad i felt , i was still very attracted to him . why should i give him up to someone else ? why should she win ?
we 're going to leave that up to detective williams . i 'll tell you though . you 're okay . you shot a real son of a bitch .
yeah . i sure know that . yeah , but how many more are out there ?
yeah . he would n't even go out to dinner . just wanted to go home .
that 's my brother . nothing could get him away from that two mule town . he coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own family .
wo n't it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them ?
i will have to face the consequences , but so will you . do n't forget they will ask how you got them .
oh , i see . yes , that 's something to think about . that 's very good . that 's what you get the big bucks , right ? ha ha .
i just think it might be important to explore your feelings for lila .
no . no . i do n't have a ... no . it was from a client .
no kidding . i 'll bet you have some very grateful clients . what 'd rex buy you ?
sweet jack . i 'm so sorry you found me asleep . do n't know what came over me .
i ca n't have been under much more than a minute .
i know things have n't been right for a long time , but it 'll be different . if you 'll just be patient , i can work things out .
i have been patient and i 've tried to help , but you would n't even let me do that .
tell what you see . write it well , sir , and make sure you get it right
if i 've got it right , my lord , you lead an invasion into zululand , for i see it all around me , but `` why ? '' is the question my readers will ask . `` why ? ''
ca n't be thinkin ' bout him every second of my day . i 'll go outta my gourd .
why should you waste your life waitin ' and wonderin ' . not like you 're married .
what a sweet little picture . mommy and daddy are n't losing a daughter , they 're gaining a eunuch !
well , if that 's the way you f ...
well , we got that out of the way . tell me , celeste . what do you do for a living ?
i 'm a sales rep. i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because i 'm a girl .
oh , mine ! thank god . actually , that does n't make it any better , does it ? are you a friend of alan 's ?
we used to fly together . i 'm ... john .
you were out at sea ! hey , guess what ? i graduated . i got my degree .

i 've been waitin ' for you miss gibson . i want you to know i 've decided to take your case .
mr. august , i 'm not at all sure -

now , none of that . please dig in .
no you 're not . you 're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake !
mom , wake up ! dad barely knows we exist .
and the good news is you wo n't charge me .
no . the good news is i found the problem and it 's not our equipment . there 's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed .
yeah . yeah ! the way people used to do it . quick and dirty , like ripping off a band-aid .
well , then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved , then ?
what 's he got against me ... i mean , i 'm a teenager . you ca n't be a citizen when you 're only a teenager !
it 's not you , johnny . your parents are rich they do n't need to be citizens , and that stuff means a lot to my dad . he 's a veteran .
what do you want me to do about it ?
i want you to take care of sailor , so he wo n't ever be able to bother my baby again .
do you deny that there 's an attraction between us ?
i do n't ... i do n't want to answer that ... look we 're friends .
relax . i 'll do right by him . you know that .
you just do n't fucking get it , do you ?
tell me , billionaire , would you warm faster to my pleas if i looked more like ms. january here ?
although the wayne foundation is hosting the event , sadly i will be unable to attend . thank you all . good day , doctor .
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue . a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . the civilian does not .

boy , i bet i know who 's workin ' late tonight .
so -- are you making any new year 's resolutions ?
i want to stop getting involved with men who are n't good for me .

you should n't have bothered . i really do n't have that much of an appetite .
stop him ! stop him ! a leg is stuck out and alex goes down . the tramp swarm all over him .

you 'll get results one way or the other , that 's for sure ... okay .
i 'm gon na be here if you need anything .
i 'm not a murderer . i 've never even met the man i 'm supposed to kill .
and , yet , a chain of events has started . a chain that will lead inexorably to his death .
they got a lucky break . yesterday they were just two german clerks . today they 're the 'honored dead ' .
you are a very cynical person , rick , if you 'll forgive me for saying so .
sssh ! once and for all , we 're in moscow !
yes , there 's no doubt of that ... just look out of the window and there it is .
you cut to the heart of things , do n't you ? what about lynn bracken ? she going to be a hooker all her life ?
i came out here with a dream . that 's gone , but i settled for reality .

you goddamn dagos . i do you a favor and take freddie in when you 're having a bad time , and then you try to push me out .
you took freddie in because the corleone family bankrolled your casino . you and the corleone family are evened out . this is for business ; name your price .
oh , do n't you worry . i 'll be fine .
you 've been a hell of a figment , pal . i sure wish i could take you home with me .
is that why you came all the way back ? to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood ?
no , but i think something really bad might 've happened to us .
thank you . no , i know you 'd prefer `` i 'm glad you < u > find < /u > me so ... ''
i 'd prefer you to say what you feel .
wh -- she 's never said anything , and we 're very close . she 'd tell me such a thing .
wh -- , it-it-it-it , it 's so sad . she 's crazy about me , but somewhere on the , along the line , i 've fallen out of love with her .
you know , elden , some people actually read more than just the classifieds ...

okay , this guy is trying to scare us . he 's messed with our property , he 's coming around the house . it 's time for an ass whoopin ' !
this is not an intelligent way to approach this .
but this guy you called , he 's not even army --
he 's former army and the best i 've ever seen in a room . besides , he knows the territory , we did basic together here . you 've had three hours with dunbar and have n't gotten a peep , we need to take a different tack .
well , it 's been known to happen in the day too . maybe agnes went to him .
oh come on , you 've talked to her . she does n't even know how babies are born , let alone made .
is this something you 're interested in ? i 'm not really that person i was .
i realize . maybe you could ... tell me a little about yourself .

you do n't think he 'd want *me* within fifty miles , do you ? -- after the exhibition he saw me give ! did you see his *face* -- ?

alright , let 's assume this whole thing is true . why does freddy all of a sudden need you ?

apparently the white house shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation , and , according to our sources , neither the f.b.i . nor the c.i.a . has met with success .

i have to be simple again , swana , and you may find it shockingly banal . i 've thought it over and i 'm willing to take all the consequences , even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living .
what do you mean `` they 're gon na have him die ? ''

we could cut a section out of that metallite netting . it wo n't hold up to that acid , but aside from that it 's pretty strong .
we have to avoid injuring it . what we really need is some electric animal prods .

well daddy and i were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen .
i want you to search the house for bugs . i mean i want you to strip it .

marylin rexroth . she came into my office and signed a pre-nup with howard doyle .
doyle oil ? a massey pre-nup ? she loves him .

that 's all right -- our men can ride your horses .
i 'm sorry , mrs. lieberman -- and i 'll never invite those people again .
what you get from renting to bachelors . all night i did n't sleep ten minutes -- and i 'm sure you woke up dr. dreyfuss .
man , i know these people in my goddamn blood !
do n't mention that word around here . you 'll get them excited .
i thought , and correct me if i 'm wrong , but were n't you trying to play both sides ?
what are you looking for ? a blow job ?
foolin ' , hell ! i would have eaten that dirt for them . they coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom ... they just never did get a piece of my mind .
and all the time you was plannin ' on runnin ' again .
what are you fighting for in here ? the good of rome ? i can end this madness now ! take the job for the sake of the gods , live !
can you stop that slaughter ? ! can you free these men ?
cool . i do n't get guys who wear boxers . my ex wore boxers . i never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up .
me neither . that 's why i wear briefs ... so why did you and ... mark break up ?
have you canceled chicago and the rest of the weekend yet ?
you do n't show for chicago , everyone 'll know there 's something going on .
well , you have knocked me for a hell of a loop , old man . a hell of a loop .
i know . you loved her . so did i. it was an awful shock to me , too . an awful shock . rose was so alive it 's hard to believe .
i 'm going to bail on the other side and wait . this bridge is the only way he can follow .
what if it 's not who you think it is ?
but , sir . well , i do n't know why . i guess , maybe , because she 's frightened that if she does n't lose the weight she may even get fired .
that 's right . she will get fired . in fact , i want you to send her back to paris .
that 's why we got ta keep going . i 'm not gon na go in for murder .
we 're on foot . we ca n't get away .
not yet - though not soon enough for some people , i 've already found . a death in the doctor 's family makes the patients doubly uneasy .
i take it you 're not wearing white to reassure them .
hang on mrs. pierce . not that tie , on the other side . that 's not the only thing your eating rachel .
mom , i 'm on a diet . you want an oinker for a daughter ?
you win , colonel . here 's the fifty . go on out and get rid of it .
you bet i will ! as fast as i can ! gon na get some canned goodsa fishing rod , and the rest i 'm gon na give away .
we know now that we ca n't beat their machines -- but we can beat them ! they are mortal beings ... the only question is whether we have time enough to do anything !
if we get what transportation we can , and pick up instruments and books from pacific-tech ...
first off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts , amanda and i have admired your work for years .
it is truly , whats the word ? inspiring .
it 's not the place . i do n't buy that . trapped in the same town forever . the price she would pay for her teenage lust .
after you got knocked up , my mother did n't want me to talk to you . she thought it was contagious .
we 'll worry about that when we get there .
i 'm frightened , terribly frightened . i ... i do n't know what 's out there , mitch .
you are weak ! i have seen it . the force is strong with him . he must be destroyed .
but , if he could be turned , he would be a powerful ally .
i ca n't get jiggy with this shit . where is the damn manager ?
sir , the manager stepped out for a moment . i 'm currently running the store . can i see the cd ?
diane ! alright , let 's stop this right now . let 's not put our energy into something ridiculous . this is n't even smart thinking .
dad , why are you acting this way ? is this because of the other morning ?
holding my own . you know that guy who was calling me all the time ? he 's started again . he 's been putting stuff in my mail .
must 've read about the funeral . sick mother . that 's the last thing you need right now , i 'm sure .
no , please listen ! they 're coming ... coming for me and my baby .
come on , sweetheart -- what is this ? who 's coming ?
if we come outta this joint with ganz ' phone number , or a dead indian , or anything else useful , then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid ...
why ? anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably ca n't get it up anyway .
buddy , two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump .
well , i 'm sorry to disappoint you , but i 'm married and i have two children .
you do n't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem .
funny . i thought that 's exactly what you did . you just do n't have the courage to admit it to yourself .
the unit is still operational , dave . but it will fail within seventy-two hours .
i understand hal . we 'll take care of it . please , let me have the hard copy .
before i took the story and closed the case , i 'd want to know a lot more about these people . i 'd want to know just about everything about them .
exactly . now i 'm the killer . and there 's something i do n't want you to know . something that would destroy my comfortable life , rob me of my friends , my position .
this one 's almost thirty years old . it 's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love .
that 's exactly why i do n't watch 'em anymore -- it 's bullshit ! why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid ?
forget it , frances . you 're not driving .
have i told you how mean you 're turning , york ?
i 'm the one who should apologize . i should have talked to you before .
is this , by any chance , going to be a confession ?
but my dear m'sieu giron , i 'm having a tea party . must i be bothered with all these papers now ?
i 'm sorry , madame , but there are still certain matters which i think you should attend to yourself . and i , personally , would not care to refer them to -- to --
pakeesa ? it 's okay . come on . it 's okay . come on , they 're just joking around .
yeah , we 're just screwing around . like mohammed said . ca n't take a joke , man ? hey , i hope you got a permit for that , mama !
do n't . we know what happened . do n't go on .
any court in the land would understand . we 'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we 'll go to the police .
i live to hear the sound ... you all right ?
what about the monitor ... ? you getting anything on the shark ?
let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential , and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the tribunal . you may proceed , dr. honorius .
by your leave , mr. president -- the tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry .
deputy director koessler does n't want zero . all he cares about is low .
perhaps you can explain it to him . it 's agent mackelway .
no shit ! that why they call him ice ?
nope . it 's the way he flies - ice cold . no mistakes . wears you down . after enough time , you just get bored and frustrated , you do something stupid , and he 's got you .
but i have promises to keep . and miles to go before i sleep . and miles to go before i sleep . got to fix the sea anchor . use the sail .
use the sail for a sea anchor and you wo n't move .
scott , i want you to meet daddy 's nemesis , austin powers .
why are you feeding him ? why do n't you just kill him ?
one thing is certain ; we can not escape on auxiliary power .
visual ! mr. sulu , divert everything to the phasers --
take a bite , take a bite . i 'm not letting go .
it 's so strong ! look at its nose . need help ?
that could be the tip of a 't . here and here . and here .
at the end is the tail of what could be an 'r .
was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon ?
uh , yeah , because the bitch shot him .
i am . he has always been our greatest protector .
i do n't understand . how can you part with it ? it has always been with you .
or disinformation ... if you wanted to , say , beam down a signal to send a ship off course ? maybe one degree a minute ?
fantastic idea mr. bond ! perhaps i should buy it for a book ! it 's totally preposterous , but - you amuse me . ... and now perhaps i can amuse you .
do n't really have the market for something like this ... i can go two ... two-fifty .
make it three hundred . and throw that in , too .
spencer 's the key here . frida is in no way associated with him . and her blood has n't matched with any of the killings .
it 's a bit farfetched that mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy . this makes no sense .
i just ca n't absorb it all . this place , the equipment . what it must have cost . why all the secrecy ? why do you wear the mask ?
i do n't want to jeopardize anyone close to me .
i saved you from the lorry and you 're not very special .
... ... ... .. it 's a bomb is n't it ?
hello , claire . how extraordinary that you came .
it was something my father always liked me to do .
i ca n't enjoy anything unless i ... unless everybody is . i-you know , if one guy is starving someplace , that 's ... you know , i-i ... it puts a crimp in my evening . so wan na get married or what ?
no . we 're friends . i wan na remain friends .
what the hell good is fixing that gon na get us ?
an answer , i hope : exactly what -- or who -- melissa was taping .
in that case -- you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars .
oh , no -- i played with < u > your < /u > cards -- in < u > your < /u > cabin -- at < u > your < /u > suggestion -- if you 've got a kick coming , make it to the purser .
i do n't carry dapper dan . i carry fop .
no ! i do n't want fop ! goddamnit - i use dapper dan !
look , i 'm as worried as you are --
no , i do n't think so . leave me alone , give me money . that 's what i get from our daughter . she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar .
you 're sacred of 'em , are n't ya ?
right down to my socks , turkey . if i'da been half as scared a that lop-ear , i would n't a fallen asleep on 'em . lonnegan might kill me , but at least he wo n't bore me to death .
no , no way , i could n't take that ...
yes , you could . i think you need it more than i do . it 'll help . i promise .
i 'm sorry i could n't tell you the truth , but i had to find out your part in all this .
alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not ?
all they want to see is your work . what 's wrong with that ?
shut up ! just shut up ! i do n't need them .
and what exactly is it that you ca n't take anymore of ?
everything ! prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- i ca n't stand it anymore -- i 'd rather die !
damn you , de sade ! you know as well as i do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual , whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country .
it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man .
fuck , yeah ! i told you so . and you can tell'em all i told you so .
you realize the things you 're saying , willie , are going to be attacked by a lot of different people .
i 'm afraid i have to , sir . you see , my father is vicar at thrums -- it 's a small parish -- not much of a living --
you 're too good a man , fettes -- i 'll not let you quit . i 'll make an assistant of you -- that 'll pay your keep and your tuition , too --
well , i do n't know what you had in mind , but i hope you 're happy . i put myself on the line for you , my reputation , and you 're making me look like an idiot .
what do you mean ? what did i do to you ...
one job i 'd never take is working around electricity .
especially when it 's two hundred feet off the ground .
yeah , daddy , that 's a roger , but we do n't sell alcohol .
what kind of bar is it if ya ca n't get a martini ? !
you know -- i get the feeling you could use a nap . there 's a rest area up ahead . why do n't you pull over and sleep a few hours ?
a nap wo n't help . i 've been awake for too long -- three or four nights . i ca n't even remember . if i go to sleep now , i 'm dead for twenty hours .
sociologist . and because . pawn shops are just like prostitutes , farm auctions and coal miners . they 're all for sale , but none of 'em would be if they were n't desperate for the money .
we 're all desperate for the money , doll . that 's what made this country great . back me up on this candy , am i right ?
think i 'll look aroun ' an ' see if i ca n't meet me a girl .
thing 's been workin ' on me , what they was yellin ' about . got me all curious .
do n't be coy . i 've always known about your feelings for each other . all these years , it 's a shame ... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other . you 're both wasting precious time .
i beg your pardon . li mu bai and i are n't cowards .
i was driving by -- i saw all the cars . are you all right ?
yeah , i 'm okay -- it 's been a long night .
he had to leave early to be with his daughter . she 's getting a divorce .
i understand that . i 'm sorry to hear that . we 'd be well advised to deal with this situation now . the insurance company - -
you 're just saying nothing ! tonight is the night .
yeah , but if we do n't sit , they 'll take our badges .
yah , but think this thing through here , wade . ya give 'em what they want , why wont ' they let her go ? you got ta listen to me on this one , wade .
heck , you do n't know ! you 're just whistlin ' dixie here ! i 'm sayin ' , the cops , they can advise us on this ! i 'm sayin ' call a professional !
it 's going around ai n't it ? mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch . i think i accidentally shot and killed my boy today .
well , if it 's any comfort , i 's goin ' in to there to act a fool baby . straight rockin ' heat and slayin ' niggas --
everything . i have a good head for business , i should be franchising the bakery . and i want you to give me your word that whatever happens , you 'll go to college . and finish .
what ! what about the group and my singing career ? what about me ?
marvin acme had no will . i should know , the probate is in my court .
he had a will , all right . she took it off acme the night she and r.k. maroon knocked him off . then she set up her loving husband to take the fall .
... going places , good junk bond department , you got the financing on that syndicam deal .
... yeah , and we 're working on some other interesting stuff .
yeah . and you 're not getting anything out of it .
and it 's like . how much more can i bob here ? you know .
i really , really , really wan na go , but i ca n't . not unless my sister goes .
i 'm workin ' on it . but she does n't seem to be goin ' for him .
i have to be simple again , swana , and you may find it shockingly banal . i 've thought it over and i 'm willing to take all the consequences , even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living .
leon ! this has the ugly sound of regeneration .
where did you find an old recording like that ?
used record shop down on turk street . i was in there looking for some robert johnson . memories ... memory lane or something ...
dickie , are you with peter smith- kingsley ? i bet you are . my aunt thought she saw him .
peter smith-kingsley ? i have n't seen him in months . no , i 'm alone .
hear you had a little trouble , quintero . defective fuse ? well , you 're all in one piece . so what 's the beef ?
you know the beef . this new rule of yours , that we work alone . we 're taking it up with the super .
you came to the right place , sir . my wife 's second cousin is english . well , scotch-irish . can i interest you in a holster ?
just luck , this , really . never been to one of these before .
kate , we do n't have all day , so i 'm only gon na count to five . one ... two ... three ... four ...
okay , okay , i promise i 'll do it !
i 'm sorry , sir , but as far as i 'm concerned , there 's nothin ' needed for space travel that this old girl does n't already have .
come , come , scotty . young minds . fresh ideas . be tolerant .
i know it 's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- -but what are you going to do about it ?
karim will have to show me where it happened . and of course , i 'll need the donkey . with any luck , i 'll sort it out tonight .
i thought maybe you 'd like to be here when she wakes up .
that 's impossible . you 'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact , i 'm counting on you --
i think that 's what it says on my driver 's license .
and you have written pictures , have n't you ?
i feel so ineffectual . is there anything i can do for you ?
watch the store while i go home and change .
should never have come out . i should 've stayed there , fought with them .
wladek , stop that . it 's over now . just be proud it happened . my god , did they put up a fight .
maybe they 're angry because they 're grown in meccano-breeders .
instead of what ? nine months inside a woman : we 're all raised the same but most of us do n't become cubs in cathedral .
it 's dark . we 'd better be getting on . the family will be waiting .
such a brief visit , but dear child , it has made my christmas very merry .
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl . fire her . or something .
lisa 's an extremely valuable member of the skywire team . we 've got our eyes on her . you keep yours on milo .
harry , are we gon na build this thing or not ?
lloyd , what i 'm saying is we may already have what we want .
yeah , i had to go slummin ' . see , a friend of mine 's bein ' framed .
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
it 's just more than anybody else does around here .
well do n't get carried away -- i 'm not that good at it .
mr. gekko -- thank you for the chance . you wo n't regret this , you 're with a winner .
... put the rest of it in a money market account for now . i want to see what you know before i invest it ... and save the cheap salesman talk , it 's obvious .
still after that first million before you 're thirty .
no , i 'll settle for half that in cash .
yes , but how often ? tell me , are you happy ?
am i happy ? i do n't know . happy as the next man , i guess . i do n't laugh all day long like an idiot , if that 's what you mean .
i have two words for you ... seek help .
i have three words for you ... ex-ac- ta .
do yourself a favor , norman . are you listening ? do n't tell anyone what you just told me .
c'mon , beth -- that report 's like the blind leading the blind .
why do n't you leave that crate and come with us ?
i have a promise i have to keep first ... to an old friend .
i do ? oh , is n't that sweet , thank you . i have to confess something to you . i must have been pretty plowed at your wedding . i really do n't have the faintest idea who you are .
huh ? no , not my wedding . yours .
i do n't know , i 've seen the business world .
hotwiring cars , rudy , does not qualify as a small business . chop shop consultant ; does n't work on a resume .
i 'm fine peggy sue . and how are you ? are we talking on the phone ? are we pen pals ?
seriously . what 's it like to be eighteen ?
i 'm sorry . well , we need the money . now we have it .
oh shit , thelma ! ! shit ! shit ! shit !
you should see the one we wear when it rains .
sunday night at the devils game , i 'm driving the zamboni .
i do n't want to take up your time now , but i was hoping you could give me some information on somebody . it 's a security level three matter and information retrieval records says to refer to you .
ok. come back this afternoon , about four o'clock . if you give me the number of the case , i 'll have the dossier here waiting . my tailor , ... well worth the investment .
so juno , how did your maneuver go last night ?
which maneuver , sir ? the one in which i moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another , or the one in which i cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes ?
it 's the truth . why wo n't you believe it ?
cause i do n't take acme dumb pills . i do n't know what you 're up to , lady , but i 'm gon na nail you for the acme murder .
this is ridiculous . i 'm not gon na be in your way - we can talk the case over .
tell you what - i 'll flip you a coin . if you win you can come with me . if you do n't win , you do n't come .
no sir ! we have genesis -- whatever you want --
< u > full power damn you < /u > !
nice try . if we ca n't get to her through you , maybe your family will be more co-operative . i can guarantee you , taransky , one way or another , miss simone and i are going to get acquainted .
i 'd like to see that , sayer . invite me .
and why are you still calling me dad ? you 're forty years old already , and --
-- well what am i supposed to call you ?
wow , i actually feel like less of a fat dork now .
most fruitful yuki is bad ass , man . you should be proud to be the same condition .
oh , no ! she died right in the hospital ...
oh , that 's a sad story . and her husband is that little fellow , works in peter reeves .
we do n't get many visitors . let 's take a look at it .
send out a boarding party . full assault gear .
you mean because i object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while i 'm eating i 'm prejudiced ?
he ca n't help the way he was raised . i kinda feel sorry for him .
just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
they said that ? really ? oh , your parents . the nelson 's . right , right . how midwest . i like that .
rob . top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the '80 's and '90 's . subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins ? `` is it better to burn out than to fade away ? ''
you just drove a fucking customer away , barry .
a woman 's intuition . something in me says it 's time to give the old boy a serious try .
wow . hey , i was just about to order some dinner . you eat chinese , right ?
quiet . you 'll wake the men , and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives .
i know . i have heard noises and echoes through the stones ...
your old man thinks i did it , do n't he ?
he does n't know you . could n't you change ?
oh , he did . half an hour later a certain timothy j. nolan went into secret session with the commission and he did all the talking .
you mean kayo nolan , the old timer ? he does n't know much .
i do n't know ... i like the army .
c'mon , ray , everyone hates the army during basic . i 'll tell you straight , i hated it here .
it 's a fiction , not a moral treatise .
but is n't that the duty of art ? to elevate us above the beast ?
and you expect me to come over , just like that .
if i expected somethin ' , i would n't be still standin ' out here in the hall .
jeremy , just let me see what you 've got .
you 're so hard . all right then . i was chatting to some people from the diary page , and the name of barrington came up . i expressed an interest ...
what i been wondering is where 's he been .
yeah , where 've you been ? we have n't heard from you lately .
and abdul and carl and sacha , they stay with the place , or i do n't sell .
of course they stay . rick 's would n't be rick 's without them .
no ! i warned the english to go back home -- i begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat i would bring on them ... why did n't they listen to me ?
we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner ...
you hear that , beavis ! we 're gon na get alcohol , tobacco and guns !
yeah , maybe some chicks too . heh heh .
you 're perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i 'm with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound , i need your help .
i 'm not interested . i 've already got a job .
just get me a coke and do n't argue with me , ok ?
i 'm not arguing . i 'm just telling you what the deal is -- congresswoman .
if he 's not madison , then where 's madison ?
i 've got men searching the building and the grounds now .
an institution ? a madhouse ? people always call a madhouse `` someplace . '' put her in someplace !
i 'm sorry ... i did n't mean it to sound uncaring ...
i understand why it would seem confusing . certain human rituals ... like weddings , birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions . these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time .
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan ?
well , when i first came to washington , my eyes were big , blue question marks -- now they 're big , green dollar marks --
i see . all right . you finish this job properly -- and you get a handsome bonus besides --
the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man . even the limits we put on it are human limits . it can do this , it can do that ! it designs , it creates !
even a god that was n't active , that just created something and stood back and watched ?
how the hell should i know ? i 've never had a wife killed before . i guess i should have hired a professional .
you want to do this yourself ? i do n't have to do this , you know .
stay smart , bud . we build a case . we play by the rules .
there are no rules ! why the fuck are you doing this ? the nite owl made you . you want to tear all that down .
that 's because there 's nothing to figure out . now will you please pay attention . i 'm not through insulting your father .
lois , have you ever fallen for a guy and he 's not like other guys . . . he 's different . it 's like you come from two different worlds .
make sure the prince does n't leave this room until i come and get him .
not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him .
i did n't say he was an informant . but since you mentioned it , was n't esparza your primary informant ?
you 're trespassing into the area of witness protection , mr. dowd . such showboating puts lives at risk .
i 'd want her statements before we reach porch . jesus , women .
yeah , like you 'd be a rock after everything she went through ?
well it 's pretty obvious you do n't want me around any more .
well look -- i was kind of upset there . i 'm sorry i said those things .
i do n't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo , numa , it 's none of our business . let 's keep this side of it quiet , shall we ?
when you 're in a war , boss , you use every weapon you got .
it 's really nice of you to help us .
i wish i could do more but we 're moving out .
right . so . you must have an enormous record collection .
yeah . i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it .
`` 4/17 : subject , when unaware of observation , prefers to hold eating utensils ... with feet . successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils ... with feet . ''
they had a case like that at johns hopkins . wires got crossed between hands and feet .
wai ... it 's so serious you could n't call to tell me you 'd be ... what ... ? what did you say ... ?
it 's all over between us . i 've found someone else .
circus folk . nomads , you know . they smell like cabbage .
indeed ... if we could get back to the business at hand . it 's one thing to have a warhead , it 's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it .
what you thought ! ? what you thought ... i 'm a workingman , i 'm trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we 're paying you , i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred ...
i 'm going to win this case ... mist ... mr. doneghy ... i 'm going to the jury with a solid case , a famous doctor as an expert witness , and i 'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars .
yes -- which is why `` quiet , dependable people '' have to take charge of their own lives .
at the cost of others ? you accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony . did you go to the castle with eduard ? then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there .
barry , you 're over thirty years old . you owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called sonic death monkey .
i owe it to myself to go right to the edge , rob , and this group does exactly that . over the edge , in fact .
you 're right , this is bad . how did you get out ?
shot my way out . everybody was shooting , so i just blasted my way outta there .
alright . she 's staying with some friends of her parents . the o'sheas . she caught the train twenty minutes ago into grand central .
grand central . you better not be fucking with me cause it 's your ass on the line .
the prince does not like to be touched by other humans . a silly eastern superstition , i 'm afraid .
yeah , well , we all got our little problems today do n't we ?
it 's horrible . terrence was one of the most brilliant men i 've known .
yeah , well , why did he hang out here ? the cops said it 's dangerous -
looks and talent do n't always go together , katherina .
looks do n't concern me , maestro . only talent interests a woman of taste .
i do n't believe that . i think you are insulted by me , somehow . you 're a foreigner too , are n't you , here , in this market ?
i should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this . i apologize if i appear abrupt . i am rusty at social graces . how do you find cairo ? did you visit the pyramids ?
