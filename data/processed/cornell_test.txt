fuck it ! i 'm doing it . i deserve it . i 've been working for those fat bastards since i was in high school and look at this place .
great . so what are you guys working on ?
oh , just checking something for an old friend .
uh ... it 's ... uh ... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to ... ah ... take certain license in depicting the cover scene ... for ... ah ... purposes involving the ... ah , market place .
well , mister beauchamp ... from what i read of this here book , i 'd have to say the writin ' ai n't a whole lot different from the pitcher .
i 'm not gon na let that bastard take my money
take your money ? this guy will blow up your house and everyone in it !
i 'd like to pay you for that laptop .
it 's no problem . but i must excuse myself , inspector .
that grass out in the yard 's all growed up . i figured i might cut it fer ye .
i told you , i ai n't got no boy , now get on out from here and let me be .
no shit . it 's the goddamn water . kill an ox . i buy bottled for my danny . you ca n't trust the taps .
yeah . jesus , you look like fucking royalty , tommy .
what about the oasis in the desert ? are you telling me that was a lie ?
no , that was n't a lie . that was ... a mirage .
mum ... oh mum , god will surely strike us -
wind - i love you with that which is endless within me . bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice ...
you do n't like public enemy ? it 's the dope shit .
i like 'em , but you do n't play anything else .
every variable but < u > yourself < /u > . you do n't eat , sleep . you ca n't live in your head like --
< u > i 'm < /u > not the only one in there . i got you , vic , ben , johnny , all rattling around in there .
but the boys told us they did n't get any .
oh yes , well , come to think of it , they 're right . we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them . but you could n't approach them . they were a wise bunch of birds .
you see , five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me ... but i prefer this !
i hate you because you depart without kissing me . that 's all .
look , you wan na be elite ? you got ta do a righteous hack . none of this accidental shit .
oh yeah , you want a seriously righteous hack , you score one of those gibsons man . you know , supercomputers they use to like , do physics , and look for oil and stuff ?
i 'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches . if you 've got something to say , lecktor , say it .
i want to help you , will . you 'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself . we do n't invent our natures , they 're issued to us . along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else . why fight it ?
so how goes your `scholarly ' pursuit of batman ?
oh god , bruce . you 're still jealous .
i wo n't be more than ten minutes , i promise you .
even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you .
he did n't eat the kid cause he 'd just swallowed a bear .
sobek . half man , half croc , oldest god --
everybody needs money . except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his . people like that .
jack would n't kill for it . besides , who would pay him ?
i would like to marry you . but i have already promised myself ... to god .
but ... you 've done so much for god as it is ... ca n't you do something for yourself for once -- for jeanne ?
there are two more prisoners , admiral . do you want them killed too ? surrender your vessel !
all right , damn you ! all right ! give me a minute to inform my crew .
your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific .
yes . this testing done by my country left a terrible mess . we are here to clean it up .
that is a contradiction . the borg act as a collective consciousness . there are no individuals .
i am the beginning ... the end . i am the one who is many . i am the borg .
ah , sir , you know , it 's not for me to say .
what do you mean ? who can buy this kind of equipment .
since we learned about mental illness , paranoia , schizophrenia . all the things they taught me in harvard . mrs. macneil since the day i joined the jesuits , i 've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism , not one .
yeah well , it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed , and needs an exorcist .
i 've had it with you . i 'm leaving .
bruce wayne is out of his mind . next time you call him up and he ca n't go out friday night - - think it over .
< i > he killed two children. < /i >
fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial .
oh , fuck , seth , that 's my only pair !
do n't worry about it , we 'll get you some glasses .
what the fuck did i do wrong ? ! tell me !
you blabbed , quaid ! you blabbed about mars !
he 's right , captain , it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys .
tell that to private james ryan . we 've got our orders . let 's go .
not bad for government work . having a good time .
have n't had so much fun since live tv .
we let lecktor 's message run as is and decode it after . or we pull it , work our the code and put ours in next week .
can we still get lecktor 's message out of the paper ?
but it 's stupid , right ? you admit it 's stupid .
no , i do n't admit it 's stupid .
hey , skins -- get away with that sheet metal all right ?
easy , that new checker faked the receipt . here it is , boss .
no , man . it wrinkles my shit . let 's grab a fuckin beer --
c'mon , man , not in front of the baby . put on your seat belt before i get another ticket .
right here . in the 7th street subway station .
what was he doing down here ? a billionaire waiting for the subway ? why not drown him in a bus ? why drown him at all ? why not shoot him ? is the hitman from the lost world of atlantis ? i mean , come on .
oh , fine . she 's gone away for a little while and when she comes back i 've sort of resolved to really tell her how much i care for her .
that 's terrific . do n't be afraid to be demonstrative . you 're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke .
look , you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go , and he goes , right ?
well , yeah , but the tether off it ai n't gon na be fancy . when he gets down there he 'll just sit , like a dumb-shit . unless something wanders through view of the camera , you 'll get nada .
he works for colson . he used him on the pentagon papers . we 're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a white house consultant . after the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his white house safe .
howard hunt is working for the white house ? no shit ! this is goddamn disneyland ! since when ?
ronald , you do n't know what you 're talking about .
do n't know what i 'm talking about ? i know that you fucked cecile .
the fucking rapists , man . the punks who raped that nun . the $ 50,000 reward from the church ! remember ?
yeah . sure . yeah . we 're on it bigtime . lots of leads . you bet .
why does n't he let you do what you want ?
yeah ! tell him off ! it could n't get any worse .
you mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug ?
i 'm el gato . i always land on my feet .
did you get smashed or what ? you have to eat if you 're drinking . and not just those little salads .
i ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with gregory .
faith , sir , if i want to learn good principles , it 's surely better i should apply for them to your lady , and your chaplin than to you ?
he wants to step into my shoes ! he wants to step into my shoes !
but i think we should talk about it . or are you fully convinced that we too wo n't understand each other ?
there will be plenty of time to talk about it later . we 'll get married soon . that way we 'll have more time ...
how many minutes between the first and second whistle ?
that 's funny . it 's interesting . i never gave it a thought before .
who 's being selfish now ? i 'm the one getting married . i thought this week was supposed to be about me .
we got ta slow down . i 'm so tired . let 's just get out of here .
see , if you packed your piece you could 've made the guy see sense .
uh unh , carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket .
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month . the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs , and how i faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance would n't sky rocket .
heh , well , that 's tv journalism for ya . stage the news to boost ratings .
i do n't think so . you do n't want to end up on page of the daily news .
my parents do n't read the daily news . all right , if you think i should n't . i ca n't believe the things the papers are printing . i 'm sure most of it 's not true .
great . hey . i 've got a bit of a problem . i know some things . that could help your father but you might get into trouble .
jeffrey . are they important things ? well forget me - you have to tell him . jeffrey . i mean it .
i tried to tell them , but they would n't listen to me .
i 'm talking about invention , no investment . i know what people think of me . mr. spasmatician . dick the square root . i 'll show them . you said i was going to be a millionaire . and you 're gon na help !
life will take care of everybody . diego , me , you . it is the teacher .
i get it . i 'm really pissed , pablo . you know the dea knows about norman 's cay . for chrissakes , diego worships adolf hitler and john lennon , that 's fucked up !
nothing . why do n't we walk to my dorm ?
i 'm not up for running into anybody . let 's just kick it here , alright ?
but you 're still tormented , you must be , you 've killed somebody ...
do n't you put the past in a room , in the cellar , and lock the door and just never go in there ? because that 's what i do .
no , i will . i do n't want to leave something out because i know i can say anything to you . you 're a liar , and a thief .
take it easy how mad you make me , i 'm the only dad you 've got .
well , i 'm writing another article on the cacophony .
ah , ca n't stay away from her , can you ? like a moth to a flame .
fuck ! nothing 's ever goddamn good enough ! it 's always been that way .
it 's cause they do n't like their lives , so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you ... i had a father like that .
- i told you ! he was there ! -
- but as i 've explained to sidney , without proof , there 's just no story . do n't you agree mr. bond ?
`` get her ? '' that was your whole plan ? you call that science ?
i guess i got a little overexcited . was n't it incredible ! i 'm telling you , this is a first . you know what this could mean to the university ?
my only concern is the human tribunal . is n't it yours ?
yes -- which is why `` quiet , dependable people '' have to take charge of their own lives .
reads the infrared . then kills it . little something the r & d department came up with ...
how long were you gon na let me try and stop it ... ?
colonel , let us help his soul find it 's place with the almighty and ...
he looks as if he 's sleeping , does n't he ?
that bastard ! i 'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order , son of malkovich .
i 'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel .
home is here in grandma and grandpa 's new house . at least while i 'm in college . remember our deal .
the kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here .
what lecture could be more important than the will of baron beaufort frankenstein ?
'functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull . '
let 's not forget , folks , this is a study on sleep disorders .
ah , yes , which reminds me , who here thinks they 'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs ?
it should . you nominated him for spec-recon just three days after you nominated me .
jordan . might we do this over lunch tomorrow ? i do very much want to talk , but now is scarcely --
i ai n't a priest , lieutenant . i ca n't hear your confession .
do you make the three negroes for the nite owl killings ?
you always were a son-of-a-bitch , were n't you ? a little weasel with a quick , dirty mouth .
at least i 've stayed true to myself . which is more than i can say about some people .
how do you figure ... hey ! you ca n't roll a joint in here !
relax brother . what i mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around . a dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what 's that shit ?
clay bertrand . he 's in the warren report . he tried to get oswald a lawyer . was kennedy ever discussed , jack ?
sure . 'course they hated the sonofabitch , but ...
well do n't drag your ass . there wo n't be much of a window for us to link up . we 'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours .
yeah , i know bill , i came up with the plan remember ? just have those hangar doors open and ready , i can take it from there .
well ... they told me that i was an accomplice ...
oh ... they 're fucken crazy . that 's a snow job . do n't listen to that shit !
that 's illegal . you want us pulled over ? i 'll turn around at the corner if you 'll shut the fuck up .
< u > you 're < /u > doing all the talk .
i 'd love the company . and i 've hunted all my life .
well , why not ? you seem so calm and experienced . why not , indeed !
dr. grant , we 're not leaving without our son .
you can stick with us , or you can go and look for him . either way you 're probably not getting out of here alive .
do n't pick up and leave without saying goodbye .
course not , compadre . you 'll see me again .
okay , lieutenant dish . i guess she 's already ... involved with somebody here .
they 've all tried . nobody 's got to first base .
no , you 're not . so stop comparing yourself to him . you have no reason to ... you have everything you ever wanted . you 've earned it . why ca n't you just enjoy it ?
i do . i do . in my own way .
it would take a minute or so . you wo n't last that long out there .
peter , you could n't even fix our tv !
it 's a commercial area . no one lives there .
but he had to dump the body there to make the move .
i do n't think i should have opened my big mouth . sorry , ho-jon .
that 's okay . live a little , learn a little .
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world 's most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted .
dad , i really think we should call the cops .
no ! we ca n't let anyone know about this thing ! we got ta play ball with these guys - you ask stan grossman , he 'll tell ya the same thing !
he 's a newspaper publisher i know -- and --
what makes you think he 's got *anything* to do with it ?
-- what are you talking about , come on --
-- all i want is the number of where she 's staying and that should be god damn good enough , now stop treating me this way , please -- just give me the number elizabeth please now i think i will kill you if you do n't .
'the space shuttle 's seismic secret ' . 'the oliver stone-george bush connection ' . oliver stone ?
stone is their spokesman . you think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they 'd let him do it ? stone 's a disinformation flunky . the face that he 's alive says it all .
oh , do n't worry . i 've already overlooked the fact your name 's not actually on our guest list .
well , i owe you one , do n't i ?
but ... if we were able to separate china from russia once and for all , we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century .
by offering cuba to the russians as a consolation prize ?
why do n't we just rent a lear jet and haul it back ourselves ?
because i wan na see this hot shot bandit do something that ca n't be done . besides , there 's nothing i like better than breaking legends .
have n't you already done a bit of that ?
no , no , i have n't . not really . i 've growled a little , but i have n't bit .
if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle sin is this : my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , which mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ' kiss .
that 's a ford , not a ferrari . you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford ?
that 's not just a ford , that 's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang .
all set . foley 's rooms in the senate office building -- nice , big clean desk -- lot of senator stationery to write his little boys on -- and foley 's secretary , saunders , to make it look like the real thing --
good . are the newspaper men at the hotel ?
umm . and would admiral kirk have access to such information ?
i would think so , sir . he 's on the fleet general staff .
you 're not going to die ! not today ! i want you to do exactly as i say and i 'm gon na get you out of there , alright ?
but i ca n't ... i got ta get out of here ... skipper , please ...
i 'm fine , honey . let 's just try and forget about tonight .
we do n't need to think bad thoughts , do we mama ?
come on , ellie . stop being silly . you know i 'm going to have my way .
i wo n't stand for it ! i wo n't stand for your running my life ! why do you insist on it !
i will make that recommendation to the president . i must tell you in all honesty that i 'm extremely dubious about the results .
apparently i 'm not as cynical about earth 's people as you are .
a puff-up , i call it . but miss jessica always says `` brioche . ''
looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- i do n't know whether i 'll be able to get away with it .
luke , use the force only for knowledge and for defense , not as a weapon . do n't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... luke nods and climbs back into his ship .
strong is vader . clouded is your fate . mind what you have learned ... notice everything , everything ! it can save you .
look , we got ta think about everyone now -- the kid especially . how scared is she gon na be out there ?
oh , do n't use her like that , for a smoke screen .
fleet 's pulling the battle group back to safe distance ... they 'd like us to knock out those batteries , sir .
they 'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships . who 's got the nuke ?
your words are kind and they flatter me -- but i think of her as a sister . besides , you hardly know me .
i know that for six months you 've worked hard and asked for little . that you 're a good and honest man . what more need i know ?
according to the deposition , you said you were `` thrilled , impressed , overwhelmed '' by the quality of andrew beckett 's work . do you remember saying that ?
i may have said something like that . but that 's not how i feel at this moment .
right . a clean deduction from observed facts . they 've got to be simple once in a while , inspector .
i 've always looked forward to it . all right , let 's get him out of here and tidy up .
yeah , and um , he used to hit me too .
uh hey , does anyone wan na see my unit ?
in the past two days i 've been to so many motels , my eyes are bleary with neon . this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large .
i do n't really forget the sign , it just does n't seem ... any use . this used to be the main highway . want to register , please ?
good evening . i want to stay at this hotel .
fill this out please . and i 'll need a card .
the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves . well , let me ask you this : what kind of settlement do you seek ? what are , for you , the parameters of the possible ?
that 's the problem . i ca n't afford to give her anything .
will you please excuse me ? i 'll be right back .
we 'll save you a place at our table .
wait a minute . we 'd know about it .
the only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back . then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked .
i know . i 've been here since eleven .
man ! i hate it when i ca n't rent videos !
i am not an american , mr. russ . my daughter is not an american .
i understand , sir . but you are an honored guest of the united states ...
hey , hey , let 's just keep it simple , what i need is not the ... what do you need ... ?
what is the five grand ? what is the , you said that we were going to split five ...
that was a long one . my father used to say that whenever you saw one , it was a soul going to heaven .
i like that . are n't we supposed to wish on it ?
... so what would we claim ? he stabbed duane lindeman in self-defense ?
with two knives taped to his hands ? forget it , rog .
they 're cancelling all leaves , all passes . no more drills . we stand at full ready starting --
what 's your point , wes ? you have a point ?
whatever you wish ... this has all been a terrible mistake , gregor . i wanted to play straight with you , but edvard insisted we try and kill you .
edvard said the same thing about you before he died .
i am just thinkin ' -- now they might n't like the idea down in washington .
why not ! there 's a bill up in congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy . daniel webster is fighting for it right now --
no , i mean a crash with a history . camus ' facel vega , or nathaniel nest 's station wagon , grace kelly 's rover fix it just enough to get it rolling . do n't clean it , do n't touch anything else .
is that why you drive this car ? i take it that you see kennedy 's assassination as a special kind of car-crash ?
he 's missing . he 's gone . he left .
he 's here somewhere . find him . the sub 's on it 's way . go ! c'mon !
good . glad to see they 're together at last . they do n't get along . promotion . top job . most unfair . quite a fuss at the ministry .
you do n't say . like looking for a needle in a ...
oh no ! tell her she 's got to go back ...
and have her whole family after our scalps for floutin ' one o ' their women ? ... no sir ! come on , mrs. pauley ...
terrific ! a born stooge ! horace 'll perform like a trained seal .
jim -- if i fling a party man like horace in the face of those angry committees --
in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break .
all men lose heart . all betray . it is exactly why we must make the choices we make .
at one time i could have chosen not to be .
then , maybe i do see what you 're after -- perhaps ... you get to chose again ...
i do n't want to go to mexico , john . i want to be with you . do n't you think i care about you ?
i think you 're a lying , back stabbing bitch . but it 's nice to know you care .
the wizard of oz ? is he good or is he wicked ?
oh , very good , but very mysterious . he lives in the emerald city , and that 's a long journey from here . did you bring your broomstick with you ?
you startin ' a fan club or some- thin ' ?
says here one of our boys brought him down . you ever heard of a badge named wade ?
have you broken it yet ? we 've got six more heads and that means six more hours .
i 'm in to the directory but they 've codified the stockpile -- numerically .
we ai n't bad men no more , bill . hell , we 're farmers .
should be easy killin ' em ... supposin ' they do n't run off to texas first .
i do n't think the color of the interior is ... .
rose this not the place to be having this ...
all right ... we 're still flying . i 'm taking her down to the deck .
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level .
these bushes follow the wall into the neighbor 's yard . all we need is some kind of diversion and we 're home free .
that 's crazy , dennis . the cops will see us .
you never know how you 're going to catch a suspect .
peter 's right , captain . he 's got to be forced into making a mistake .
a sin against < i > what ? < /i >
slip up and change into a skirt , else he 'll create something terrible . do n't you want to make a good impression on your first day ?
so the idea is if a guy punches me , he really hurts his hand ?
you said it popped out too easily . nothing 's ever good enough for you , is it ?
well , it does smudge after all -- is n't that fascinating ?
i thought you 'd be interested . i 'd like you to be in on everything , annie . not just the finished book , but how it 's written .
reggie -- you have n't spoken a word in twenty minutes .
i keep thinking about charles and scobie -- and the one who 's going to be next -- me ?
who cares about bugs ? you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't know math .
do n't be so sure . i like you even if you are dumb with numbers .
but i 'm not positive it 's gon na happen tonight --
helloo ... he just had lunch with his grandmother . you know he got `` the rock '' .
what ? ! hush up , you mouthy little shit !
hey , do n't `` mouthy shit '' me - i 'm outta here .
judy , it ca n't make much difference to you . i just want to see how you 'd look and i know it wo n't be the same , but --
no , i do n't want any clothes ! i do n't want anything ! i want to get out of here !
you see it 's not easy to take a seat at this table ; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters .
the man who decides if you can play is this man harry , or hatchet harry as some including himself like to call him .
well , alexander , as a fellow scientist i know you have a thousand questions --
you came underground when the world was ending above . and you evolved . some into the morlocks and others --
that 's it , ray . i 've had it . no more parties . i 'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds .
come on , winston . we ca n't quit now . the holidays are coming up . it 's our best season .
listen , we just met for crissake ! i 'm not that kind of girl !
do n't get your hopes up -- where 's the antidote ?
sue , i need some of that anger , rage , frustration --
i 'm sure i can come up with something .
oh yes , of course . there was someone with me . a lady .
looks like you 're going to have no trouble at all . what was the lady 's name , mr. cluett ?
i must be losing my mind . at the museum today i could have sworn that terrible painting of vigo looked right at me .
who could blame him ? were you wearing this nightgown ?
ah , i see ... yes . paul 's disappearance ... yes .
so it 's nothing that official . i just have some basic questions . about paul owen . about yourself-
yes , sir . beluga . but it is eighty dollars the portion .
i 'd better only get two . how about the lobster thermidor ?
i see , off to strike it rich , huh . all right , fine , wish you luck . tell you this though , never was a rich man yet did n't wind up with a guilty conscience .
already got a guilty conscience , might as well have the money too .
aye . we be on a quest to set the world aright --
but seem to have gotten lost on the way .
and ... she 's not an illegal immigrant ? is she ? can i see her `` chart ? '' because ...
gon na be fine . gon na be fine , people ? are we getting there ... ?
now you know will , and i know , what you need to be doing . you have a gift .
i could work the pit maybe , but i could never drive like dale ernhart --
oh , they just do it to sell the newspapers , you know .
yeah , i guess so . what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other . why do n't they try liking each other once in a while ?
i brung this for when we had to kill them fellows . i guess we could use some now .
not for me . i do n't touch it no more .
karl if you put this in regan 's room i want you to tell me , now did you ?
no . it was n't me . i did n't .
if you told michael what i 've told you today , i 'm a dead man .
when is it finally over ? i want it to be over before my baby is born .
no , i 'm through with that shit . ashley 's right . got ta start doing something i got a stake in . get a business going .
i do n't know , i 've seen the business world .
but we could go to london and live in england .
no kat , i lied to you , i hate england and i do n't ever want to live there again .
say , professor tripp , is all that stuff true about errol flynn ? how he used to put coke on his dick . to make himself , you know , like , last longer ?
christ , traxler . how the hell should i know ?
i can see that . i know things look pretty bleak right now , but you ca n't get down on yourself .
i stopped taking your advice a long time ago , or did you forget ?
well , i 'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with .
i 'm sorry .. i do n't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. i feel like everyone 's looking at me ..
what are you going to use for money ? !
i do n't know . i thought , maybe i 'd move in with my parents for a while .
i always suspected the effects might come back . that 's why i had to follow you . i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records .
if you knew , why did n't you say anything ?
yeah yeah yeah ... just tell me your five main interests , in order of importance .
well , let 's see ... i guess i 'd have to put traditional jazz , blues , and ragtime music at the top of the list , then probably ...
come in , mr. juarez . i 'd stand , but , well , you know .
actually , my name is craig schwartz , dr. lester .

we could take the six o'clock train , hildy . if it would save a man 's life .
who 's going to question us ? dwayne ? jesse ?
it 's going to go bigger than that . could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it ?
the building superintendent , and two tenants . flat statements -- no hesitation . and they all jibed to the letter . the thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station .
now how could anybody guess that ? they had , perhaps , signs on their luggage , `` grand central or bust ! `` ?

well , it 's hard to call an important person by his first name . but if it really matters to you , i'11 call you ... toto ! ...
i always thought jails make people hard . not you . you 're just not tough enough to forget about beynon . i chose you , not him .

if he tells , it wo n't come true !
oh , that 's just a bunch of baloney ! we never believed that in my family !

i can always get a fresh one . karen - you 're a gibson girl ...
now that window can never be locked . it 's impossible .
see , your mind is very good with the more mechanical details . whereas my strength would be --
we got ta let the slack out , cledus ; this is costing us time .

he was n't touching me he was just ... gesturing ...
that 's your business ... i do n't care how .
like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt ?
he asked to see a policeman , we 're getting him a policeman .
but this guy you called , he 's not even army --
john believes in the basic goodness of man , and that 's fine , but gaze into the pit like i have and that view seems a little soporific . and not unlike television , it hardly represents the real world ...
there 's some good things on it , though .
hey , it 's legit . strictly dinner and dance .
okay . i think that 's all we need to know .
yeah , you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you , you 'd probably kill it .

but now ... they are all one with the borg .
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before . as an android , i am in complete control of my neural net . the information contained there can not be forcibly removed .
god , look at this poster ! i ca n't believe this room ! you 're the luckiest guy in the world ! i 'd kill to have stuff like this !
please ... go ahead and kill me ! this stuff does n't make you happy , believe me .
c-colonel , we been p-practicing takeoff 's , but i ai n't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks .
we wo n't have the fuel to get back to the carriers ; they 'll turn and run back to hawaii the minute we 're airborne .
i do n't know what happened to you , jack ... but i ca n't believe you were always this much of a bastard .
when this boat finally reaches jakata , i 'll be first off . you 'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day can not come soon enough . i 've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage .
you gaff with the < u > hook < /u > end . blood 's on the butt . where your hand goes .
sure . blood gets all < u > over < /u > your hand , sheriff , ask any fisherman .
so , you go on upstairs to the party , your lady sees you , you run into each other 's arms . music comes up , you live happily ever after , that it ?
it 's corny , but i could live with it .
there 's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well , but of course that 's not the basic intention .
i do n't care about the intention . i just know your cross action is a plus on our side . i 've seen it come through four times .
i 've never gotten a message that was n't bad news .
how someone strong like you scared from a message ? is good news i sure !
sick vandalism ! brody , that 's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message ! i want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby buster browns !
that 's it ! i 'm standing here arguing with a guy who ca n't wait to be a hot lunch . goodbye .
do n't give me that . you 're gon na get plenty rich off of this , mr. percent . we got those pg & e fuckers by the balls here .
we 've got the pg & e fuckers in hinkley by the balls . but nobody 's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate pg & e fuckers in san francisco .
we ca n't leave now . we have to do something .
why ? you 're the one who believes in nothing . screw the world , or whatever you said .
i know we banned this play , but frankly i ca n't remember why . can you refresh my memory , herr director ?
for the same reason , herr chamberlain , that it was banned in france .
look at this ! snow . ice . your idea of a good time .
a good time ! is that all you care about ? !
uh ... actually , picking apples is as much excitement as i want for a while . i 'm grateful for the job .
you 're the one who 's helping *me* , homer . you 're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while i 'm gone . candy , too .
... oh , bullshit ! he was intruding on my space , he was demeaning me personally , he was patronizing ...
... what do you want me to do , punch him out ? i have to work with him ...
who the fuck knows ? musta slipped or something . i just heard the gun go off .
i never seen a man shot before . not even in the service . must be something .
well ... if you do n't remember anything , i mean what goes through your mind then if you do n't remember anything ?
nothing . i do remember the car crash ... i told you ... i remember the glass ... i think about that sometimes ... i remember walking here , sort of . now i remember this place and you . that 's about it .
and what do you possibly think you 're going to fucking see there ?
no idea . but if that 's all we 've got left --
listen , john , you better double my attorney 's fee . she 's very inexperienced , but she done a great job for me . and give her your autograph . she thinks you 're some kinda holy man .
on the deposition for the judge , bernie ... i mean there 's no way i can promise anything . i ca n't tell him what we 're up to ...
you really mean that ? what 'd he promise you ? to take you public ? i guess without gordon 's money and seal of approval , i 'm not such a hot investment anymore . you 're just the best money can buy , darien ...
you 're not exactly pure bud , you went after gekko with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before ...
bluestar was at and an eighth when i left the office . it might spin up to by the bell ...
teldar 's shooting up . buy any for yourself ? bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office .
you need me . nobody knows the systems on this rig better than i do . what is something was to go wrong after the explorer clears off ? what would have you done ?
wow , you 're right ! us poor dumb ol ' boys might 've had to think for ourselves . coulda been a disaster .
you like to play games , do n't you , peter ?
he says on the photo he 'll call tomorrow at eleven . why not come back then and listen for yourself .
i had a trust fund my great- grandfather , or maybe it was an inheritance , 'cause he 's dead , and i spent it on shoes .
you must come with me . it 's much too late already . you must come with me to the graveyard .
wait a minute . this is the left one . he walks bad enough already .
oh , poor dorothy . we may never see her again .
i 'm serious . this is how you do it . i 'm telling you .
i know . daddy 's gon na get the rainman suite . vegas , baby . we 're going to vegas !
the hospital ? oh , that 's right -- you 're a doctor . ha-ha .
jon -- i do n't have time to play games . there 're leftovers in the fridge .
i been watching you . you done good . invested wisely . respectable businessman now . just like you always wanted .
and you ? still a pig . just a much fatter one .
my god ! it ... it < u > is < /u > him !
wh-why 's he ... why 's he up there , mom ?
yeah , colleen mentioned it . what do they make ?
c.d.s . the music kind . from the grendel label .
should we take a walk ? or maybe some food sent up , or something ...
i just want to be alone . is that okay ?
somethin ' was upsettin ' you bad last night , and you wanted to tell me and i figured you wanted to tell me so 's i could help ...
i did , honey , but that was last night ... let 's just find those two kids before it 's too late .
i ai n't about to argue with you . what 's gon na happen to them three ? ross the boss and those ladies ?
that 's up to the judge , gus . it 's not your problem anymore .
wonderful . what 's she like , brother ? what is your impression of her ?
she talks a great deal and smiles a lot . she 's very pretty , she has a real good figure . she 's very girlish or womanish , if you know what i mean . she would n't hurt anybody , this girl . she could n't .
a dime . one thin dime for a cup of coffee .
coffee , that 's a laugh . his belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey .
maybe they 'll be < u > other < /u > movies .
they 'll ... they 'll < u > blackball < /u > me ...
i do n't know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings .
oh , i 've got to earn them , and you 'll help me , wo n't you ?
my crew is going to work alongside with your men , do n't worry -- we 're a team !
why should i worry ? is there a problem ?
nice day out - er , nice night - was n't it ? - is n't it ?
yes , lovely . we 've had a lot of nice weather lately .
admiral , i do n't understand . the enterprise --
jim , the enterprise is twenty years old . we think her day is over ...
i 'm sick , tom . i need a cure . vitamin b cocktail , followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline . not as good as beer , but all i got .
come on , frank . there 's blood spilling in the streets .
lothar , can you arm the bombs for impact ?
but i told you , i do n't think we can get the bomb bay doors open .
if he passed me materials , i 'd have them . i do n't .
we 'd like to recover any materials mr. zavitz may have given you --
oh no . she 's here . i brought him along . and my daughter , too . we 're staying at peterson 's ...
you mean you hauled him all the way out here ? just like that ?
yes . look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here .
this is a done deal . all but the paperwork .
i fucked her countless times ! in every orifice ! and all the while , she plead for more --
we inspected the body , marquis . she died a virgin .
i 'll tell you all about it ... ... but not here .
it 's been a while . i thought maybe you 'd be in touch .
it 's over now , dennis ! do n't hurt anyone .
we 'll burn this fuckin ' place down ! i got gasoline all over in here !
could n't sleep . kinda wanted to talk to you . do you mind ?
no - not at all . i could n't sleep either .
you could help me find her . you know the people . i 'll pay you a hundred dollars .
i can make that in a lunch break ! look , hiram , you 're sure it is n't just me ? -- you decided you liked it , after all , the other night ; you 'll hang around for seconds ?
if i 'm not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can i do this ?
you 're strong enough . but you 're going to need courage , willow .
miss teschmacher , superman is a fairly bright individual . my understanding of the way he works is that he wo n't be fooled by a simple trick .
good . fine . now where 's my parachute ?
he wo n't have anything to do with him . now you say it 's all right for him to stay out here in the back ?
fine with me . if he steals anything , i 'll take it out of your pocket anyway .
mr. clyde you 're twisting things around . i was n't masquerading . luke trumbo ... luke was a good man who gave his life for his country . i just ... happen to look a little bit like him . that 's all .
yes , i see that private trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead . i also see that you were posted stateside during the war . fort dix ?
and if he can raise public opinion against us -- if any *part* of this sticks --
he wo n't get started ! i 'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours . i 've done it all my life ! i 'll blacken this punk until -- joe -- your job is back in the senate -- keep those men fighting him *there* .
i have a gun . it 's under my bed .
you do n't know what you 're fucking with here .
look , you 've been jerking my chain all day . if there 's some reason you ca n't talk to me -- like the fact that you 've already leaked everything to the new york times -- just say so .
listen , i 've got a dinner -- ca n't we do this tomorrow ?
well we 'd love to , but we 're going to another party .
well ... that 's wonderful -- i 'll stop by there for a drink .
i do n't believe it ! i do n't believe a word of it !
all right . i 'll prove it to you ! you believe everything they 've told you - without proof ! i 'll prove my story !
god , they wo n't expell him . they 'll just suspend him for a week or something .
he used a real gun . they should throw his ass in jail .
i 'd better be getting back . bye , love .
pulls his coat on . honora gives him a peck cheek .
do n't make me sit through one of your plays .
hey , pop . i know you do n't like the commotion of opening night . but i especially want you to see this play . it 's new territory for me . and for you too . i have to know what you think .
no , not that . i 'm talking about the associated press . they got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to mike and i. did you tell them that we were lying ?
no . i should have . i told them i disagreed with you , mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original . i 'm not lying for you . i 'm not gon na shut up for you . not on any of it .
because i will not allow you to turn this courtroom into a circus !
well i do n't think it 's a circus . and i do n't think they do either .
you made it possible for us to get away at a few hours ' notice -- you never asked why , but i guess you know .
news travels fast on broadway -- you had to get away from a rat --
... is it me ? is there something i 've done ?
oh , no , sweetheart - it 's not you ...
you 've been doing some research in the archives .
i want to know what my child is going to face .
god damn it ! i still needed to case that fucking store . it 's too risky to show my face now .
i got a couple thousand bucks . you could leave town .
from the first time i saw you at school -- all those years we were married to other people i always felt like we were connected .
i remember thinking you were the one part of my life buddy did n't have a piece of --
... and because they have warp capabilities , the consequences to their society are minimal ...
you 've done a terrific job , jean- luc . now , pack your bags and get the hell out of there . how 's data ?
soon you 'll be able to take the holy mass , and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood , you will be at one with him .
i want to be at one with him now .
so signor miles drove away and you did what ?
i went to bed . freddie 's a big man , but i 'm in trouble after a couple of drinks . i 've suffered all day . who found him ?
i 've come from jacqueline . she needs money .
i thought you told me you did n't know where she was .
who the fuck are you ? why 've you been following me ? come on , fuckhead !
hey , relax man , i 'm a brother shamus .
you did n't hear ... nothing ! are n't there any lights in this place ?
two switches over there , but i was n't going to be the first .
umm ... did n't you ever wonder about me ?
well i did n't know about you until after she was gone .
oh ! my god ... i 've got to get you on the plane !
did n't i say i was taking the two o ' ...
i 'm sorry , i 'm not familiar with it . what style ?
uh , sort of nouveau deco ... with a big vestibule . check it out next time you 're up there .
i like what you 've done with the place .
it 's comin ' along ... want a beer ?
no , only when she felt like it . she brought me up here last winter and the next day she died .
no wonder ... wait ... agnes ... agnes how do you feel about babies ?
huh . right . college . wow . where are you going ? where 'd you get into ?
well , i got in everywhere i applied , but cornell is my first choice .
do n't you think you 'll get a little bored living with a drunk ?
that is what i want . why do n't you go and get your stuff ?
told myself -- if he shows up , we 'll stick with him .
you know , i 'm not a hugger and yet ... i ca n't let go .
but to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible ? it would take a carefully organized plan , tons of combustibles and hundreds of people .
from what we can tell , there are hundreds of agents , all over the city . the combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand , and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city .
ahm , well , you know ~ that 's a tough question - on one ' level i think it ... .
do n't ask him about work , charlie . life 's too short .
if i told you it might not come true .
what is it you want , mary ? what do you want ? you want the moon ? just say . . .
you 've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and rowan together . is n't that right ... ? they 're reaching out to you , rowan !
but it does n't make sense . they - they used lasher ... they conspired with him .
now , joe , you know it was all a mistake , do n't you ?
no , it was n't , it was intentional .
so what 'll you do if i feel nervous ? you 'll open your meaty , sympathetic arms ... ?
sid ... you got me so ... i do n't know what ...
oh , yes . i 'll show you . i have much more colors at home .
that 's good . that 's good , sweetie pie .
it 's my condition . i never know if i 've already eaten , so i always just eat small amounts .
you do n't have to remember to be hungry .
they know you were at that meeting , peter . they 've been told , and they know .
leo , you 're my agent . tell `` them '' to take a flyin ' piss . i did n't do anything wrong . i fought in the war , for crissakes !
i 've got a lot of respect for you too . for the way you feel about your family .
jack has n't loved me for years . and now i 'm afraid she 's turning out to be like him . so cold and distant . i 've let him make her like that .
nothing like a little cheery news to start the day .
say listen , doc . i got a new theory about all these suicides .
what do you mean lied about who you are ?
i suppose i always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody .
sweeney tells me you do n't have computer confirmation ?
you know , captain , if you had n't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors , you might 've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col- ...
sailor , you are somethin ' else , honey ... when i was fifteen , mama told me that pretty soon i 'd be startin ' to think about sex , and i should talk to her before i did anything about it .
but honey , i thought you told me your uncle pooch raped you when you was thirteen .
listen to me , baby , there are going to be beautiful babies there .
trent , i do n't feel like going out tonight . i got shit to do tomorrow ...
i do n't know what you 're talking about !
sure you do . sending mac out on a little recon work . how pathetic . problem is it seems mac blew a few fuses . or maybe he 's just a little drunk . were you partying with a robot taylor ?
so whaddaya say pal , wan na play some doubles at piping ? meet the membership ? i got a little blonde named mandy , about nineteen , avec cafe au lait boobs ... she 's mine but she 's got a cousin who has great muffins .
... sounds dubious chuck , but piping rock any day .
hhhuh . so we decoy her . stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she wo n't know the difference .
yeah . like in against all flags . only they use a couple big hams .
you 'd go to jail . for a long term .
correct . i could n't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me .
the commissioner was saying you were the one that caught dr. lecktor three years ago . he killed nine people , did n't he ?
nine that we know of . two did n't die .
shoulda ' felt up tammy in the pool , that time ...
whatta ' you whinin ' about ? he said i 'm next .
thank you very much . how much will it ... ?
on the house . you did me a favor . check the corridor .
i 'd have knocked you off those bottles , put a bullet in your ass and be half way to new york right now .
after all these years of blissful silence , i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be .
stay out of this elias . this ai n't your show .
you ai n't a firing squad , you piece of shit ! !
you 're gon na be at john k 's party ?
my man is deaf . i 'm going to john k 's party ! neh .
get `em ready . you ... come with me .
eighteen thousand feet , sir . and two hundred knots ... otherwise it 's suicide .
huh . but it 's still a story without an ending . what about now ?
now ? i do n't know . i know that i 'll never have the strength to leave you again .
very well , general , what is it you wish to say ?
your majesty , i have been advised that you have received a letter from napoleon , offering a peace treaty , and that you have decided to accept it .
c'mon , it all worked out . you came out okay in the end ...
i did ? what do i tell a source on the next tough story ? hang in with us . you 'll be fine ... maybe ?
what was he like , when he was little ?
little . very little . and skinny , very skinny too . that is compared to me .
do you want to be questioned about you and mr. jimmy ? please , clayton . it will be better if i find the body alone .
but how 're you going to explain this ? how did you get him out of the pool ?
i know exactly what you mean . today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the sec . all they want to do is regulate our natural growth ! it 's happening across the country !
to everyone , i 'm afraid . the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession , as we know it , is being legislated out of existence .
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective . we 're making a statement .
oh , good . something new and different for us .
my father needs a doctor . < u > please < /u > .
hey , i 've got a situation here , in case you have n't noticed .
you are sick , that 's why he 's here .
he 'll pinch my cheek . i hate that .
i 'm not fucking you . not for all your cds .
you want me to die ? i thought you and i were tight .
i suppose that 's your wagon in the river .
some people who went by this way lost it . two men and some women . they packed their stuff on horses and went on .
i 'm ... '' mentally divergent '' . i would love to believe that .
it can be dealt with , but only if you want to . i can help you .
um , excuse me , we 're having a private conversation here .
yeah , get out of here ! beat it !
pretty embarrassed , to be honest . i had him .
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard .
you better put on the lights . i ca n't see what i 'm doing .
no - no lights . we do n't want anyone to know we 're having a party .
just a soupcon of lemon ... ... it improves the flavor with champagne .
no caviar for me , thanks . never did like it much .
i want ta tell ya one last thing before i pull the trigger .
pull the trigger ? ! have ya lost it woman ? ! now just calm down here .
when i meet with tattaglia 's people ; should i insist that all his drug middle-men be clean ?
mention it , do n't insist . barzini is a man who will know that without being told .
but you 've stamped this form before ! why wo n't you stamp it now ?
you 've just said yourself , miss , we 've already stamped it . why should we stamp it twice ?
not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
we 're not doing it ! i 'm not even sure it 's christian .
keep quiet about this . i do n't have any license for him yet . i 've only had him a couple of days . nobody can feed him except me . i 'm the only one he trusts . watch .
do n't go to any trouble . we believe you ... we believe you .
tell me about that job in alexandria , dave , the big motel you 're building .
near alexandria . it is n't in alexandria , it is outside it .
you have not slept with your husband for five years ?
now and then . he gets drunk a few times a year .
no . it 's your turn to tell me , clarice . you do n't have any more vacations to sell , on anthrax island . why did you run away from that ranch ?
dr. lecter , when there 's time i 'll -
my job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be .
oh , here it comes . one of those 'meaningful relationship conversations . ' i never should 've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
dr. bright , i do n't have to do anything .
but in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period . there will be no way to stop it .
ya know harry , i think this whole experience has soured me on women .
yeah , we should never let a woman come between us again .
you 've been talking to that venomous fishwife , addison dewitt-
- in this case , apparently , as trustworthy as the world almanac !
why not admit it , honeythorn gump . we 've lost our way entirely .
long as we do n't lose heart , jack ...
well , you should be , because this time i 'm going to win .
well , then this time you 'll have to stay for the whole match , wo n't you ?
sacrifice play . hack up one body , leave it at start of the canyon . like a bucket of chum .
< u > trawl < /u > with it . there 's a cable on the sled . we can drag the body behind us .
i always wondered what you mayors do when you 're not cutting ribbons .
sam ! hey podner ! you caught me playing hooky --
he musta changed ! i got to get into the nung river , here or here .
that village you 're pointing at is kinda hairy .
every actor is an invention , viktor . do n't embarrass yourself . no one 's denying that you discovered simone . but it 's like finding a diamond in the desert . anyone can trip over it , but it 's not the finder who sparkles .
-- no , no , i did n't trip over her . you do n't understand --
n-not yet . i 'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers . geez , remember when we were teenagers ?
yeah . you did n't wan na take me to the prom .
no , thank you ... and i 'm afraid now i really must be going .
well , i hope that you and your wife can come to the i.a.c . conference in june .
oh , here and there . i flew something similar in my academy days .
all right , then this is old stuff to you .
statistically speaking you should 've accidentally guessed right by know .
in addition to `` psychic dolt '' this test also proves i 'm unlucky ? two of hearts .
hey , hey , hey . c'mon you guys . obviously that 's a little more than our budget will allow . basically , we 're looking for something around two-hundred dollars .
oh , why did n't you say . for two-hundred i got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back ... i 'll gift wrap it for you . the deal is fifteen hundred . cash . take it or leave it .
it 's nothing . i just think us girls should stick together .
if it had n't been for you , they would have kicked me off the train . i 'd be out there in the middle of nowhere , sitting on my ukulele .
you see , you knew the answer all the time , general .
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt , mister president .
... you have a little ... uh ... something on your face ...
oh , i got a pimple ... this stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color ... like it really works , ya know ...
i 'm sure there are worse people to talk to , but i do n't know who they are .
i 'm just trying to understand what 's going on .
yes , a despicable human being . he was in the ministry of culture . his job was to get rid of jews in the arts .
yup , that 's him , that 's the guy . you know what else the little creep did ? he kept files , close on 250,000 files . and you know what 's in those files ?
it must have taken him a long time to get them together .
years . this collection is as close as he 's ever come to an achievement .
but i want to help , i want to .
you 're too well known , wladek . and you know what ? you musicians do n't make good conspirators . you 're too ... too musical .
some of rhodes ' men . at the door .
that bastard . i did n't think he 'd make his move so fast .
our pursuit ships have sighted the millennium falcon , my lord . it has entered an asteroid field .
asteroids do n't concern me , admiral . i want that ship , not excuses . how long until you can have skywalker and the others in the millennium falcon before me ?
but we 're hungry -- and i have to pick up my costume for the pageant ! it starts at seven !
it 's only one o'clock ... why do n't you get another fudgesicle -- i 'll be done soon -- really soon .
maybe later , but first i want like to know why you 'd steal from your own company ...
when i was young , i read < u > billboard < /u > and i could not believe how much grendel records and how little of it my idiot father old jack grendel got .
death may be the result ... . are you sure ?
i must do this for paul , but what of my unborn child ?
some justice department lawyers and an fbi man , and some people from the committee to re-elect , yes ma'am .
and the underground garage one . would i know him ?
what is that ? a pencil that writes in ink ?
it was marty 's turn to be confused . huh ?
i do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .
that 's no way to talk , boy . now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago . stirred up a lot of trouble . they 're always after you colored boys .
as long as your driving does n't kill us .
it 's okay , we 're just about there .
it 's kind of weird sitting here with you in stephanie 's house . all those times you came into the restaurant . it 's like you 're a real person now . almost .
yeah , i know . it 's kind of weird . out of context .
ca n't really focus on birds at the moment , pendergast . i 'm tryin ' to keep my breakfast down .
in this violent world , i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things .
some job . card filing and cabinet dusting . four years in this dump and i have n't written anything for wilson that a wounded yak could n't do .
i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts . too bad no one else did .
well , today 's saturday and it 's still not here .
jesus , peggy . take it easy . i 'm not used to that stuff . you always did the bills . blame the damn post office .
one chance here , eduardo . make us believe you got a boss . no boss , it 's all on you .
it 's a death sentence . i 'll never make it to the trial .
excelsior ? why in god 's name would you want that bucket of bolts ?
scotty , do n't prejudge . a ship is a ship .
but where 'd you go , toto ? ! !
i 'm here ! take it easy ! take it easy ! sit down , sit down ... did she come ?
he 's okay , clair . you wan na give him a little room ?
man , i must really be stoned . thanks , buddy .
that 's impressive . how did you do that ?
i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home . i also promised that we would never come in there again .

but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps ?
we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort . have n't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep ?
it 's just money . you should be glad you 're alive .
it might be best if we did n't talk .
you 're not worried that someone might take him ?
well , not until now -- for christ 's sake .
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here . no matter how hard it is , we have to stay focused on the details .

both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign . autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films .
and that 's why i want you to be on the pleasantville chamber of commerce .
oh my gosh . i hardly know what to say .
we 'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation .

do n't , beth . do n't lie to me .
lesson number two . never work for your former spouse .
that 's not nothing to do with it . you cooked this story up and you know it .

your neighbor -- udall -- is taking care of him .

you got ta be more careful about that shit . gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they 'll expect me to bust you . and i 'll be outta a job .
but we mean it because we are a peace- loving country . are they a peace-loving country , major .
i do n't know , sir . but they 're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are . war just does n't make sense any more , for anybody .
there 's always talk , always been talk , and always will be talk . do n't they say how i 'm trying to take over the nation , how i 'm getting rich off the nation ?
we 'll get to that , too , but this is n't just talk any more .
that < u > is < /u > the plan ... i mean , goddamn it ! what the hell are those things ? how could they bury an entire plymouth station wagon ?
< u > why < /u > would they do it ?
it you really loved me , steven , you 'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds .
finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal , is n't it ? the `` o.j . '' knife with the not-quite- retractable blade ? your `` jim jones kool- aid '' that was exactly that ?
well , listen , you did n't know me before frederick . i 'd ... i 'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning , and ... go on .
oh . you must have been , uh , very unhappy .
why do n't they have tv shows about people whose daily lives you 'd be interested in watching . y'know . like skinny little weakling . or big fat guy . sick old man . family of losers . would n't that be good ?
two blacks and a mexican in a car . who 's driving ?
i do n't know , i do n't know ... i just know we 've made too many enemies .
sir , bob and i are gon na have to testify before earvin 's committee .
i want you out of here ! i want you out of here !
let go of me ! let go of me !

how you and ma doing ? have n't seen you in town for a while .
we 're alright . your ma 's sleeping . you want me to get her ?
no , give me my damn money back . right now , and i do n't have no damn receipt neither .

we do n't write up anything until we 're done ... .
what 's this about ? because we < u > fought < /u > ?
do n't flatter yourself . i always liked that line .
and i suppose it 's my fault ... why do n't you tell him that too . that 's what you believe , is n't it ?
rather than being so occupied with my thoughts , you would have been better off trying to understand what anna was thinking .
yeah ... but if you hear any more noises , tell your father . okay ?
okay . have you got enough gas to get home , marty ?
good , what are you going to do ? do you come back ?
no ... i ca n't ... i got tired . i want to live my way .

do n't call me antoine . my name is wally .
i 've never heard of her . maybe something else was on his mind .
no . i think she lived her a long time ago . like twenty-eight years ago . when dad was eighteen .
no , of course not ... i never killed anyone ...
then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger ... too strong perhaps ... ?
do n't joke . after major strasser 's warning tonight , i am frightened .
to tell you the truth , i am frightened too . shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding , or shall i carry on the best i can ?
you 're the tom hardy i 've been reading about in the papers , right ? new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres .

god , daniel , i 'm not going to make agent orange .
if this young man had responded instantly to your command , do you believe the ship might have been spared ?

well ... i might be going out to dinner .
faith . so far you 've trailed the man halfway around the globe . at this point , i do n't think another fifteen feet is gon na tip the scales .

dr. lester , i have a question . i was in that vacant office down the hall and i stumbled upon a little door and ... .
ah . yes , the little door . there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes . if you hurry , you 'll just make it .
yeah , and make it extra muddy , i did n't sleep a zee last night . sheila fills a cup . buzz lifts it to his mouth , his hands trembling .
you do n't need coffee , mr. fazeli ; you need a vacation . sheila catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot . she puts a ken head earring in her right ear . buzz follows sheila 's gaze .
petty thief , six months imprisonment kingston penitentiary , .
i keep explaining . you 've got the wrong man . my name is bellini - antonio bellini . bellini , caravaggio , both painters , i think that is confusing you .
why do n't you assign one of your own men to this ?
because with your special talents , i 'm sure you 'll do a better job .
concerned . i 'm just the hall monitor here .
it 's not only financial assistance . what he 's got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money . it 's not going to happen on the phone .
need to have you check these out before he goes on that walker benefit .
sure thing . put them here ... i 'll take them .
... nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline ...
... where is everybody ? ! i 'm half frostbit !
no , major , i do n't . they have no regard for human life . they would n't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won .
gee , sir , that last remark does n't exactly make all the sense in the world .
when 's that novel of yours coming out ? we all want to read it .
soon , soon . say , this is my buddy jack . he 's getting married next week .

it was your cause , too . in your own way , you were fighting for the same thing .
i 'm coming ! keep dead quiet . do n't even breathe .
i 'll be right here . i wo n't leave you .

do you always listen to what your mother says ? selina . something you choose your life . sometimes your life chooses you . save the day..
i do n't know if i can do it alone .

i mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles .
what ? what ? you talking back to me ?
i 'm telling you do n't say nothing to me .
shep , sit ... sit ! so , i understand you 've got a real emergency down there .
well , to tell the truth , they really did n't fill me in on many of the details . just told me to pick up captain kramer .
i doubt it 's my mind that interests her . i tell you prof , she 's a fiery lady .
well , try not to get burned . you have a great mind , jacob . do n't let anyone tempt you away from it .
well , of course , it 's always dangerous ...
i know that answer . if we went to trial would we win ?

it does n't make any difference where she is .
so what 're you goin ' up there for .

so the headaches may not even be a part of this ?
i do n't see the humor in this . go to your room immediately . you 're grounded .
grounded ? ha ! the story of my life . i do n't wan na go to my room . i wan na import japanese cars . i wan na go to liverpool and discover the beatles .
what 'd the messican mean , a sick horse 's gon na get us ? did n't make no sense .
he was quoting the bible , revelations : `` behold a pale horse and the one that sat on him was death and hell followed with him . ''
listen , i 'll be nearby so , if you need some help , or you get stuck again , do n't be afraid to give me a call .
thank you , will . i 'll do that .

and my input was mostly ... editorial , really , when he 'd been drinking-
i 'll bet . jesus  `` the grand productive days . '' what a goddamn phony .
yeah , and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow . tough break .

it does n't matter ... he 's next to you . you know , i always say to myself , you should have left him years ago . why did n't you ?
as they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes . to feel it , to know it , is to be in touch with the will of every living thing .
i do not think i like the sound of that .
not for the actions of another . no one is responsible for any actions but his own . human beings -
but i am not human . i am only -
bob , i got ta bad feeling about this , i ... i 'm telling you i got a bad feeling , man , i do n't think i 'm gon na make it ... y'know what i mean ?

of course we do . we have to sign our taxes .
you can never be too early or too thin .
all right . give me a voucher for expenses .
what expenses ? all you need is carfare to long island . you 'd better get a shave and a shine , because you , you 're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is .
this is just our cover . we 're dedicated to a higher purpose .
now i get it ... you 're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money . you 're part of a cult .
look , asshole , i do n't got time for this . if you got a problem , you better take care of it yourself .
oh no , no , no . no can do . you enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and i do n't care if it 's a styrofoam cup or the exxon valdez ! you 've got to learn to take responsibility !
he 's doing the same thing you did to him , playing letterman on tv .

i suppose so . she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung , but i do n't figure she counted on us takin ' off together like this ... i guess this means you 're breakin ' parole , then ?
you see , when you travel , everything is small , self-contained --
the spork . i get it . you 're very clever .
milo ? shrot suspects somebody broke into # i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts .

unless we 're supposed to whack out the fuckin ' pilot , i do n't think we 're gon na have to work in the next five hours .
i do n't want to show up hammered . we 're supposed to be representing max .
you gon na get rough now , threaten me ? i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken ?

morpheus did what he did because he believed that i 'm something i 'm not .
the boys and i were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars . some interesting connections there , do n't you think ?
definitely . i suppose it all goes back to queen elizabeth .
... jack 's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry . he used to be a sweet kid , but it 's like , when he found out he could n't play ball anymore , he changed . now he 's like everyone else .
i 've been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley , instead of twombley shooting himself . i 've been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose .
that ? i hear a mob : unemployed , drunkards , vagabonds ... the world 's dregs .
well , i hear 'the people ' . indentured servants , freed slaves ... escaped slaves . the world 's castaways . and , my fear is , in the scramble for power that 's coming , you will betray them .
well , sure i would , but -- aw , i 'll bet you 'd be scared .
we can scare him more than he can scare us .
do n't you think , do you still think it 's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now ?
i 'm her father -- supposed to be , but i 'm not able to . yes . yes , i am . it may be the only thing in my life i 've been so clear about wanting . even if it takes a big fight .

i do n't give a hoot in hell 's hollow what it means to her ! she ca n't stay in this house forever ! i fired her , damn it !
it sounds like a farm to me . calling it a dairy establishment , that 's just trickery and flummery .
hon ' , nobody 's bothered but you . look around -- they could n't care less .
ed , this is n't the real world ! you 've surrounded yourself with weirdos !
two men in the world do n't need passwords or codes . their retinas will scan to unlock everything . one of those two men is the chairman of the bank .
let me guess . his retinal plate is in there .
aye . but there are fenians reported on the mainland .
the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated , i 'm sure .
police ? why police ? das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen . no , no . it is all nonsense ; it was an accident .
you do n't know it was an accident . you only saw a dead man and three men carry him .
we do n't know who he is ... ... i 'm going to talk to that little girl .
are you crazy ? she ca n't hear you .
darling , ca n't you see i 'm relaxing in here !
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw .
you 're too late . there was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to . but he turned to dust and blew away . i do n't have any power for you to take .
i do n't believe that . lao motions to grange with the killing blade . grange relaxes his deathgrip on the crow . move in close on eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief .
no , thanks , mom -- i 'll go up to bed now .
do you want me to come up and tuck you in ?
majesty ... we have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week . if we distributed some of that , we would have time to gather more before --
aramis ! i have been expecting you ! we are satisfied , that will do .
my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg . i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex . is she fertile ?
she will breed . if she do not , send her back .
this is so exciting . it 's windthorne , her first love , right ?
maybe . are you ready for the next chapter ?
... four months . june to october . mmmm ... same the year before .
another month and we do n't see 'em again 'til next summer .
i just want everything to be perfect between us .
i know . listen , we need to take a time out here . can we talk seriously for a minute ?
what would you say that was supposed to mean ?
well ... it 's obviously intentional ... some kind of attempt at communication ... maybe it 's a symbol that means something to them ...
i wanted to talk to you . the other guys -
i did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but do n't think we 're friends . i 'm sorry , but i have other things -
great ! you 're going to believe that fat dweeb mr. hardy over your own daughter .
i 'm not sure what to believe anymore , young lady . you never used to lie to me . but lately you do n't seem to know the difference between right and wrong .
i 've got to get back to the office .
i only get one today ? gee , how exciting .
i 'm not your boy , jake . i do n't like you , and i do n't like what you are . i got no choice but to do business with you . this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience .
do n't say that . i had a marriage of convenience with grace , and look where that 's lead . well , looks like we got ourselves a pact .
well , we got $ , and we wan na buy ...
all right ! quiet ! for $ i could give you ...
i 'm not a deadbeat . i work when i need to .
yeah ? and what do you do the rest of the time , live off your trust fund ?
is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here ?
yes , ma'am . four long , hard weeks of sacrifice for my country ... for my people ... for you . but i survived .
well , i 'm no aviation specialist . but i do know it 's hell of a lot lower than anyone else .
from what i understand , it 's pretty much whatever we want .
i made you coffee . that oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little .
thanks , it 's starting to kick in . i feel almost human .
frida , this hair thing is all in your head . you 're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone .
it 's just as well . i 'm afraid of getting hurt again . mark seemed great at first too . i do n't want to get too attached to peter and then find out he 's a creep .
we 'll talk more about this . i 'll see you later .
one question . if i 'm not myself now , just who do you think i am ?
no motels registered any tan ciera last night . but the night before , two men checked into the blue ox registering a ciera and leavin ' the tag space blank .
geez , that 's a good lead . the blue ox , that 's that trucker 's joint out there on i-35 ?
i 've been busy , gerry . i got a full schedule .
this kid 's special , sean . i 've never seen anything like him .
come clean , betty . at night you weep for those lost closeups , those gala openings ...
not once . what 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ? it 's really more fun .
i do n't know . a hundred , hundred and fifty . how many miles is it from colombia to miami ?
fifteen hundred . we 'll have to stop somewhere to refuel .
who cares what your name is ? who cares if you 're mr. pink , mr. purple , mr. pussy , mr. piss ...
oh that 's really easy for you to say , you 're mr. white . you got ta cool-sounding name . so tell me , mr. white , if you think `` mr. pink '' is no big deal , you wan na trade ?
oh , no , no , do n't be ... tsch ... do n't be silly . you know , i 'm startin ' it-i 'm startin ' to get some feeling back in my jaw now .
oh , sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience .
look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with what 's happening here . tell us the truth ... is that the truth ?
you 're a cop - you 'll never believe me .
he 's going to have you the rest of his life , hildy . ca n't you give me another hour ?
i do n't know what to do , walter .
wait a minute , wait a minute . she 's unconscious ?
go look , man . go look . go see for yourself , if you got the guts .
well , he ai n't gon na be around no more .
pity . what 's say we have a drink ?
i do n't know , what ? thirty , forty maybe .
do n't give me that shit . you know exactly how much you lost . what 'd you drop ?
the forbidden zone was once a paradise . your breed made a desert of it , ages ago .
we 're back at the beginning . i still do n't know the why . a planet where apes evolved from men . a world turned wrong side up . a puzzle with one piece missing .
i got a couple thousand bucks . you could leave town .
leave town ? they 're going to know me in fucking des moines now ! ... they got over ten million in jewels in that place . that 's freedom , man . i could go anywhere i want .
it 's ... it 's nice , paul . it 's got ... character .
when i wrote my first book , i used to carry it around in this while i was looking for a publisher . that was a good book , marcia . i was a writer then .
what do you mean tip the cops ? is the man a lunatic or what ?
will you relax ? this in no way affects our business . go on .
what 'd you expect ? that 's his job .
listen , we ca n't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something .
no , joe , i 'm swimming here . then i 'm going home .
i guess what i 'm trying to say is -- i 'd like us to be friends .
really , trip , can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change ?
fuck you , lex ! this whole thing would n't have happened if it was n't for you jinxing us . i just made an honest mistake .
nick ! he wants to know how to rob it , and he 'll leave you alone ! that 's all he wants ! i hate him , nick ... you know how ...
so get him outta your life . get out of michigan . they got perfume counters in chicago , do n't they ?
-- and is miss lawson a patient of yours ?
yes . i 've been seeing her for over a year .
hey , just cancel that shit right now ! you 're hurt . you 're hurt really fucking bad , but you ai n't dying .
all this blood is scaring the shit outta me . i 'm gon na die , i know it .
public enemy ! all i 'm trying to do is cheer us up . go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care .
i do n't want old sad bastard music either . i just want something i can ignore .
i know . it 's not like it makes all your problems go away .
then again , that 's easy for me to say , since i 'll never even get a date . i 'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you .
we ? are you implying that i 'm taking you inside ?
we 're doing this together . we 're partners .
you will do as you please . it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other . do you not agree ?
yes -- but i am afraid of being deceived .
what are you doing there ? have n't you even started ?
hello -- eddie ? hildy johnson . was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup ?
i figured that much . why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for ?
you see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions . you know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country .
do n't do it . do n't aim at the head .
used to be , things were bad . no job ... no money ... no girl . now i got all that and i 'm crazy too .
i did n't even have the chance to get really good at sports . i was n't bad . i thought i was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and ...
what about the obvious remedy ? reversing things . maybe getting a job on a newspaper .
one of those goddamned car alarms . what 's going ...
ruben 's gone to look ... it 's banged up but it looks like a .44. it 's son of sam . is it son of sam ?
maybe , yeah . hell , i do n't know .
well what do you think happens when you die ?
you must n't . you 've got to stay here now .
stay here ? ! what 's the matter with you , bob ? you 've been acting strangely ever since we came here . i 've never seen you like this . why ca n't we leave ? what 's stopping us ?
twenty dollars is a lot of money . are you sure you can trust me with it ? i mean , are n't you afraid i might steal it ?
if you want to steal it , that 's your business . at least i wo n't have you around here making noise . it might be worth it .
you ca n't do this ! you owe me , o'brien . i made you plastic ! i made you !
that 's right . and making me was the biggest mistake you ever made !
joe profaci . carlo gambino . vinnie mangano . joe bananas . they all got ta die .
you ca n't fuck with them . they 're heads of families !
i ca n't believe your grandparents never come down here .
you have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wan na run up and down the stairs . shit - i forgot to pick up the cigarettes .
so the defendant knew the deceased , your son , even then .
they fished t'gether . went to school . carl junior treated him like a white person . like any friend .
fuckin ' walking around with a big head . you better check yourself ...
nicky wanted to take over . he wanted to go after gaggi , go after the skim , go after everything and everybody .
i heard about your little misadventure yesterday , miss connell . on your first `` day off , '' too .
well , i had a good time up to a point .
what ? what happened to `` i 'll treasure whatever you do ? ''
paul , it 's not worthy of you . throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me . you can leave that in .
i have to admit i was skeptical . until now .
so was i. the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not .
of course she does and i must say i 'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital . i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill .
she hid it from us , doctor . she 's afraid of the hospital .
it 's the way we do it . the way we 've always done it .
i know , but we 're on a college campus ...
ruben , my god , i ought to put you on report .
you 're right . i ca n't stand that bastard . sorry . this is something new . not the same guy , that 's for sure .
and tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of immortality ...
stop rehearsing your column ... is n't it strange , addison ? i thought i 'd be panic-stricken , want to run away or something . instead , i ca n't wait for tonight to come . to come and go ...
dr. towler , who was in the operating room with you ?
ms. nevins , nurse-anesthetist ; dr. marx , of course ...
they 're used to people in trees , not in a clearing . it may be tight .
not for me- i 'm too bulky and it 's your idea , you go up there . take the others to the water tower for the night .
i did n't want to say it ... but i had a feelin ' santos was up to somethin ' with your mama ...
my mama ... so sailor , our histories have been somewhat intertwined .
no , what i see is a jealous old machinist who ca n't stand that his son 's become more successful than himself .
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man 's wallet .
okay . but what if i 'm not in < u > too < /u > big a hurry ? what if i take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life ? to smell a flower ?
that 's great . let 's do a take .
rizzo , did they have chinese food in your time ?
i think i had some when i was eight .
this is fifty bucks . i need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow .
you 'll have it in the morning . now be a sport and lem me have twenty bucks to put in my pocket .
the phone . what did you hear on the phone . tell me . word for word .
you said hello , to frank . you wanted to talk to someone ? don ? and little donny . you said something about momma loves you . and something about a meadow lane . something in an hour . i do n't remember any more .
well , son , i 'm glad to see a stone come up in the world again .
now look here , ma . i 'm not a boy anymore . i want that understood . i do n't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life . mary 's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
what ? the curse 'll be lifted ? < u > will < /u > < u > you please < /u > !
i ... you 're not going to understand this .
a new < u > take < /u > on the ... well , sir , we 're coming back , we 'd like you to try it out , this evening ...
listen to what i 've ... listen to ... does anybody know morse code ?
there will be more to the prize than that . power will come with it -- and it must be used for good .
the days of magic are ending . the world is changing .
i want you to tell me everything you remember , father . from the beginning . everything .
really ? god ... i would n't know where to start ... and yet ...
who cares ? ! we 're on a roll ! these are the moments in life you 're supposed to grab .
but ed , we 're not even married . and you do n't have a job .
it 's ok that i 'm calling , right , i mean ? it 's ok .
yeah . no . it 's ok. what 's goin ' on ?
who said , `` go exploring '' ? we want this staying on track .
who 's the `` we '' ? there 's you and there 's us . and all we got from you was bad intel . `` low-level producer . '' yeah , right ...
could it be the crew ? if they were in suspended animation , would n't that effect the scan ?
if they were in stasis , i 'd get a location , but these readings , they 're all over the ship . it does n't make any sense .
people thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers ' ?
they were proving to her they were n't . they were very drunk . things were different back then . you think kids are sexually bottled up today ... .
robert bain , driving me ! jesus fucking christ !
after those cops , you 'll never be able to come back to cleveland .
and every cat 's watching , ai n't they ? it 's a toe-down .
that 's what it is . walk on out .
we do n't really know , sir , but bluntly , our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather .
the weather . i see . keep me posted . i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions .
come on , we beat an instructor . how many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll ?
just once , if they take your plane away .
you ca n't build life like you put together blocks , toddy .
what are you talking about ? i am an anatomist . i know the body . i know how it works .
it 's a metaphor . it 's women who always think there 's some unknown out there that 's going to be better than what 's in front of them . and instead wind up with nothing .
metaphorically , i still do n't have an amana freezer .
as soon as i heard elvis was on the loose , you came to mind .
i checked your release date . i never liked coincidences .
yah , you bet . it 's in the lot there . brand-new burnt umber ciera .
yeah , okay . well , siddown then . i 'm carl showalter and this is my associate gaear grimsrud .
yeah i guess so . you 're a neat girl .
so are you . i mean you 're a neat guy . we better get back .
oh , nothing much . just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself . if you do n't want me to run it --
oh , that 'll be all right , hildy . go ahead , run it . and you can say i treated him well , too . 'lo , earl . how are you feeling ?
my parents are going to wonder where i am .
one phone call from the principal will take care of that , my dear .
not much danger here , ma'am , i would n't think -- right here in the heart of edinburgh .
they 're uncommon bold , the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on .
aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers . so ...
transpo ? how they bringing the loads in ... ?
why do n't we go over to the theatre and see what 's really happening ? after all , we 've only heard from a small portion of the audience . let 's hear what the majority thinks .
the majority . the majority . yes . let 's hear from the majority .
they only arrested that poor soul because he 's japanese .
seattle boys think he 's guilty . they say the evidence is rock solid .
you 've got it . i 've been hopin ' you 'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he ?
he 's not any kind of program , sark . he 's a user .
we 're supposed to meet him here . is ruiz on the list ?
ruiz is always on the list . he just ai n't here , though .
it 's the gibson , it 's finding us too fast .
man , there 's too many garbage files , i need more time .
what i have done , i had to do .
but at what cost ? your ship ... your son .
newt time then can walk right up and knock .
but they do n't know that . they 're probably looking for other ways to get in . that 'll take them awhile .
she went to the fight with herb shuttle , i guess .
you think you could find me a pencil and paper ?
do you know her poem that starts `` seaside gusts of wind , /and a house in which we do n't live ...
yeah , yeah . it goes `` perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines '' ?
i sell them at the recycling center . gives me a little for gas and food .
looks like you live in here , for chrissake !
do n't worry about it . it 's just a b picture . i bring it in on budget , they 'll book it without even screening it . life is too short .
but lipnik said he wanted to look at the script , see something by the end of the week .
'every week by forty million people . i am a respected journalist . ' have you won any awards ?
are you kidding ? the golden globe , the edward r. murrow award ...
... years of thinking the matter over , i began to see that the whole thing was n't really my problem .
what rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing ? the sorts of things you 've ...
this is entertainment you 're making , toby . this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has , with this brady crisis , evolved into something much richer and more provocative .
yes , i know but still , it should be somewhat entertaining .
listen , either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what 's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims . he 's a mcdermott . i know what his choice would be .
i suppose you 're right . but i still do n't like it .
hell , that 's worth three , easy . and you got your waiting period .
i 'm not waiting ... so give me the gun and keep the ring .
willingham , when he tossed his cell , took polaroids so they could get everything back in place ...
have him meet me with pictures of lecktor 's books ...
that 's easy for you to say ! you ca n't get scared , you do n't remember how , you fucking idiot !
just take it easy , this is n't my fault .
we 've got to get these kids out of here ...
i 'll make sure there 's no kids left in the dorms ...
washout rejects , guys he said were `` dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead '' ...
he 's telling the truth up to a point ...
ma ! stop ! what do you want me to do ?
do ? what can you do ? what did you expect ? he was n't jewish . did you know bow they live ? your father would never stay out this late without calling . in thirty years he never stayed out all night .
but what if andy gets another dinosaur ? a mean one ? i just do n't think i can take that kind of rejection .
hey , listen , no one 's getting replaced . this is andy we 're talking about .
pack up . i 'll see you get back to london .
look , i can help . you need a sensor expert . you 've got one .
i was just going to get some food . pizza . maybe we could .
you ca n't kill my father that easy . he 'll fight forever . like with me : has n't talked to me in three years . but it 's okay . sometimes you have to put things behind you .
who knows ? guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies .
just think 'i 'm gon na do it ! ' program yourself . see yourself making it . it 'll happen . i know 'cause i just read this article in cosmo , and it was about that very thing .
who me ? ... no , i do n't know , not me ... all i know is ...
our friend , groppi , went to his mother 's house . and when he was there ... at night ...
okay . we 'll deduct it from my salary .
now , now , do n't let 's be small about such matters . we wo n't keep books . go on , unpack mr. gillis ' things .
come to the railing and i 'll hand it up .
benjamin -- i am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion . now if you wo n't do me a simple favor i do n't know what .
actually , yeah , she was nervous about gino coming , wanted everything to look right . you know women , mick .
sure , cease . they make us do stupid things , do n't they .
i detect a note of reticence . are you , perhaps , one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative ?
well , betty , there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly ...
there 's something about him , is n't there ?
do n't tell me you 're a believer now ?
it 's got to sound like an < u > acetate < /u > recording , .
hold it a minute , benny , we 're going to tweak it a bit . this may take a while .
seventh , files section . what should i do ?
he does n't know you 're up there ! just stay right where you are ! call the police !
dr. hirsch ? i 'd rather not be by myself .
of course not , david . i 'll fetch in young miss price .
that 's all right . maybe she could have fooled me . but ... she did n't fool my mother .
your mother met her ? can i talk to your mother ?
its barely a scratch . the dome broke my fall .
well , at least it turned out to have some purpose .
tell him the state of mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown .
state of mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown . you got that ? !
sean , do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery ?
i do n't know ... got ta be at least four to one .
hey butt-head , why 's that guy holding a sign ?
uh ... maybe he 's blind ... huh huh , check this out .
i 'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon .
just shut up and close your eyes . this 'll hurt .
keep your friends close and your enemies closer . when i get through with her , she 'll be the premier blow job queen of the tri-state area and poor little court 's heart will be shattered .
why go through cecile ? why not just attack court ?
no faith in our new-found goodness , detective ... ?
sure . but sometimes we got to create some numbers . the task force is run by statistics , you know ...
-- i find it degrading . maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- and you told me that . still , there 's some kind of imagery that 's haunting you and , i think , getting in your way --
do n't worry about it . they 're perfectly safe . we can pick them up after school . my mom wo n't be home . it 's no problem .
all right . after school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to detroit rock city .
calm yourself , doctor , the operation is almost complete ...
thank you , nurse . jim , she 's ready ! lock and load !
dad.. it 's not a big deal . did n't you ever stay out all night when you were young ?
yes but i was a boy . and i still had hell to pay .
i trained in the east , myself -- cornell -- and i do n't care what anyone says , there really are regional differences . i found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing ... did you ?
oh , yeah , very tough . but i guess that 's good ... to keep out the quacks .
captain , i 've activated transport inhibitors around the village ...
good . let 's begin to move these people out ...
... whatever is within my < u > power < /u > ...
... and that is what you need to expand .

how do you know what i 'm going to say ?
ma ... ma , i -- i ca n't go to the dance . i jus ' ca n't ma . i ca n't hardly stan ' it , with connie not here -- an ' me this way .
why , honey , it makes folks happy to see a girl that way -- makes folks sort of giggly an ' happy .
those guys ai n't so tough . i fought plenty of guys tougher'n them .
now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender .
oh , i do n't know . i guess it 's just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be . you know , like in the movies .
that 's the problem . when you 're a kid you think life is gon na be like the movies . dreams come true , the good guys win , people live happily ever after ... all that crap . turn .
but they 're nighttime hunters , hector , he 'd probably be on land now anyway .
'cept he was n't before , was he ? you know , when friends or family members say things , they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger . you 're fat .
but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first ...
he will be hurryin ' and he will miss . that there is as fast as i can pull an ' aim an ' hit anythin ' more'n ten feet away ... unless it 's a barn .
dickie promised me he would never take off this ring .
let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this .
we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours ... there must be some design schematics ... blueprints ...
we 're tearing this place apart looking for them ... but the computers are down , and the fires destroyed half the files ... so far , nothing .
you 're dead , you 're fucking dead elias !
you - you 're going to fuckin ' jail , buddy , you ai n't getting away with this one ! ! ! ! !
and thank you for dressing up for us . this is very classy . tell us . what kind of professional plans do you have ? what 's in your future ?
well , i was thinking ... i might work for you .
that 's funny -- so was i. guess the ocean makes one sentimental

the luckiest son of a bitch in the universe , erin . the luckiest son of a bitch in history .
well , i do trust him . lando 's an old friend . must have been an accident .
chewie , do you think you can repair him ?
why did n't you jam it down her throat ?
it 's not quite that simple . i 've dealt with prisoners in my time , but this one
he 's a nice boy , you 'd like him . he wants to be a fireman .
ye gods and little fishes , a fireman . put on some clothes , rose , you 're naked as a jay bird . when you 're dressed , come on downstairs . i 'm afraid your friend billy is injured , where are his clothes ?
are you kidding ? you think this is my idea of morning-after conversation ?
do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets ? i do n't do those .
he totally freaked . i 've never seen him like this . he 's out of his fucking mind .
that 's okay , as long as he believes it was johnnie .
you know , if you let me come over to your place once in a while , you could put on a clean shirt in the morning .
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place ?
i think i would rather just turn them over .
i am not interested in what you would rather ; i want to keep going . i am also offering you the money , so we do n't have to turn them over because you can borrow .
talks all day , too ! how the hell can you put up with her , john ?
what the hell -- i love her . and she 's great in bed .
mace , you 're my friend . i need you . plus i 'll give you % of what i make tonight .
lenny , this may be a hard concept for you , but friends do n't have to pay their friends .

then go to the party . run with the herd kenny . just do n't spew out all that 'be an individual , assert yourself ' crap anymore .
what do i think ? i do n't want my answer to be influenced by what i want , so i 'm going to have to say i do n't know .
yes . i do not know , either . what do you want , george ?
when i left him , he was in his bed , safe and sound .
you bastard ! you tortured him . you tortured him , you bastard . where is he ?
i 've always been a heel . i guess i always will be .
you do n't have to make a pose of it .
sir , i understand what you 're doin ' , but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner .
you 'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve . there is no wade , there was one , but he died a long time ago , he 's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name , you understand ?
i 'm not gon na kill him . shut the fuck up . what , do you know what you 're talkin ' about ? i 'm not killing anyb-
oh , well , then , have him killed and get it over with .
no , i want more than that . i beg you general , make sure -- drive a knife through my heart -- anything .
you ask that of me ? you 're afraid to live in your coffin . you know what that means ?
i 'm not trying to pull against you , cooch . i 've just been having nightmares about the way leo was killed .
your first homicide , that 's gon na happen , ray ...
i do n't know what you 're going to say , but i think that ...
i was just going to tell you that i love you . i said it .
if i 'm not back in fifteen minutes , hit the buzzer . that way she 'll let me go .
nothing 's going to happen . i 'll come with you .
i 'm afraid that 's not up to me .
then why am i talking to you ? get out .
maybe , if you tell me the things you have n't .
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper -- frank sent me on it .
oh for crying out loud ben , you do n't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
well , elena and i have kind of been talking , not really talking , but --
you had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow .
i wan na go -- the trip do n't bother me none .
yes , i know . cause the dooley sisters were n't in yet .
no - because me clock struck four , and when it strikes four , it 's one .
look , i 'm a victim here , too . i was a year away from getting my masters in art , now i 'll never graduate . my life has been permanently disrupted .
permanently disrupted ? are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has n't this 'incident ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?
all i can offer you is a rufus over your head .
oh , your excellency , i do n't know what to say .
agent little weasel , federal bura of your imagination .
jesus christ . you 're hammered . what are you doing ?
why not , it 's all true ! the board is using this poor guy ! they 're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap !
it 's pure speculation ! why , they 'd have my butt in a satchel !
when he says , `` discussion '' , how do you take that , agent desmond ?
i do n't take it , sam . i give it .
monsieur blaine , i do n't know how to thank you .
oh , save it . we 've still lots of things to do .
andy ... we do n't want the viewer to get out of their chair . they might change the channel .
but it 's funny ! it 's a practical joke . they 'll get frustrated !
them 's the breaks , right ? no war stories for this pup .
that 's where you 're wrong , clayton . you 've just told one . a very good story indeed .
he 's in the dumps , sir . agnew . every time you have him attack the press , they give it back to him in spades . he 's become the most hated man in america .
yeah , good old spiro . well , better him than me . what the hell is he but an insurance policy ?
he who is not with us is against us .
those are the words of a broken spirit . my spirit is whole . i have trusted d'artagnan with my deepest secrets , and i will never believe he is my enemy .
it 's still taking too long . the people used to snap to .
that was because of ... the reputation the gang had .
was it my fault ? did i know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in ? i meant to be with you on our honeymoon , hildy -- honest i did .
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom , i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube ! you do n't deny that . do you ?
i was impressed with what you said in english class today .
gilfond 's okay , except he thinks hemingway 's great literature .
i 'm here with you . ca n't that be enough for now ?
i do n't know . i do n't see you for months on end , and when i do , you put this wall between us . how do i break through ?
hey monty -- you think we 'll get any business today ?
i 'm handing out a free lei to every customer ! what do you think ?
do n't do anything stupid , cotton . you 've come to far .
gale , i do n't know what i 'm doing from one moment to the next . i 'm just taking it as it comes .
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you ... speak his mind . one who was n't afraid to tell you what he wanted .
i did . i did , reed ... but i wanted < u > you < /u > to be that man .
i 'm not an intellectual ... . i mean , i read , but ... fund-raising is n't what i ...
look , if you want to kill jews on your free time , fine . we need you to raise money . will you do that for us ?
partially , yes . but doctor , that 's an active case , i 'm not involved . if -
do you know why he 's called buffalo bill ? tell me . the newspapers wo n't say .
pino , get a broom and sweep out front .
vito , get a broom and sweep out front .
i 'd love to ! or should i pretend i 'm busy ?
let 's have a minimum of pretending . i 'll want to do a column about you-
yeah , she gives you shit and you take it .
okay , enough . enough . gim me the tickets . i wan na hold onto them .
better than cousteau , or compagno with computers , telemetry , defense department funding ...
i saw a show with sea otters , and a big turtle ... mikey loved it . made me promise to get him one . will you live on the boat ?
there 's only two hardware stores on the whole island . we 'll check that out . what about the blood ?
not a drop . maybe the guy works for the red cross .
that was before i met one , of course .
now i must hear this song . an authentic pirate song . have at it .
you scurvy shyster bastard ! watch your language ! you 're talking to a doctor of journalism !
what the fuck are we doing out here ? somebody call the police ! we need help !
... make some trips into the city . sometimes , overnight .
hey , any help you need , we 'll cover .
i 'm sure you 'd be able to design some very lovely things .
i do n't know about that . and then , who 's interested in beautiful things nowadays ?
we 're < u > all < /u > risking our lives !
that may be . but dad stays where < u > he < /u > is , and i 'm staying here !
well hello there , young employee of the sidewinder .
look , i already told you i 'm not going to give you a ride .

disorientation , nausea , migraines , hallucinations , insomnia , paranoia .
you 're talking tomorrow . today is what counts .
you intractable son-of-a-bitch . if your father could see you now ...
she 's half romulan , jim . the admixture makes her more volatile than -- me , for example .
than you . yes , i see that . by the way , thank you for this .
you seem to be familiar with the stab movies . here 's how we play . i ask you a question . you get it right , your girlfriend lives . you answer wrong , she dies .
i swear to god if you lay a finger on her i 'll fucking kill you !
i hope so . hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero .
what time are we supposed to get to the hotel ?
cant be too close for me . right across the street from it suits me . anything else listed ?
there 's another man -- right outside the booth here . i never saw him before .

everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent . nobody knows you 're here but me . we 're trying to get a quick court date . a month , maybe two , tops . i 'll spring you as soon as i can .
i 'd be too scared to ask him for it .
oh , well , then -- we 'll ask him for you .
so ... what ? so we should just make pretend over the phone that we 're dating ?
i do n't know . maybe we should just see what happens .
he claims ? powell , has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists , pulling your chain ? or some kind of nut case who --
i do n't think so , sir . in fact ... i think he 's a cop . maybe not lapd , but definitely a badge .
hey , boss . wondered where you 'd gotten to .
i just ... wanted to be put on my own for a while . clear my head .
i wo n't lie -- there have been times when i had to do it , times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man did n't .
we live in a singular world , my friend .

you 've got a fruit loop in your hair .
you say that like i do n't know that .

perhaps you 'll want to consult that ouija board again .
i feel like i know you girl . i feel like i 've known you forever . you gon na lem me see your scars ?
you do the right thing . sit with me while i heal , let it develop slow .
not the way you 've constructed your group , it 's just not ethical !

in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue .
who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - `` bringing up baby '' - would turn into a `` cradle to grave '' concept . he is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation .
look , duff - if you 're free , i 'm not working tomorrow .

he was n't superhuman dewey . he was n't superhuman at all .

i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments .

awright . i got me my electric train , mama . i finally got -- hey , what y'all doin ' up there ? !
join the party , genius ! come on up !
mirrors , then . it 's done with mirrors .
he grabbed me ! he held me ! he set me down gently ! how could that be done with mirrors ?
well , it 's off ration . we know that .
how do we know they did n't plant it there ? they know we 're mad on jam . they could poison half the country .
it is all his majesty can afford . he has even donated his very own personal savings . his majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families .
i know ... but the english want her very badly , and i have to tell you that they are proving much more generous .
max , what is it ? what are you doing ? what 's happening ?
i 'll tell you what 's happening . we 've struck gold . not fool 's gold , but real gold . the mother lode . the mother lode . the mother of them all .
down to your heart . i 'm gon na clean some fat out before you drop on me .
wait a minute . wait a minute . al , you leave my heart alone ...
so , after you graduate you go on to basic flight , right ? is that in pensacola ?
yeah , then if i get jets , it 's on to beeville , texas .
i would n't say that . careless , maybe .
no , just dumb . if i had any brains , i would n't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls ' band .
nigel , get out of here . and do n't come slithering back . nigel shakes his head .
you need me , selena . i 'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate .
not for me , you do n't ! you do n't let me eat the pies ...
no . since mama lost her job , we do n't have no more pies..
i told you to cut down on the sugar .
i ca n't help it . i 'm just weak , i guess .
do you have a , ah , film called 'slave of love ? '
what we got is just these here . what you see .
... and this ... he pulls alex 's nose .
... and that ... he pulls alex 's ear , pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest .
i need very little sleep . we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange . i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs .
well , comrade , i am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else .
if you had a license , i bet i 'd have seen it by now . how old are you ? fifteen ?
look , i 'll tell you the truth . jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back , she has a license , but i mean ... look at her .

he said , and these were his words , he < u > valued < /u > our time together , because i was civil .
did you ever think , did you think , after he escaped , he would come after you ?
that 's right . and we need more money .
the heck d'ya mean ? what a you guys got yourself mixed up in ?
fortunately such news comes very slowly where i live .
i think if we all worked to publicize it ... all of the congress ... every avenue we know .
i thought when we put him on the board of directors , he 'd ease up on us a little bit .
i wonder what 's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway ?
roy ! what are you doing in san diego ?
myra and me come down to lajolla for the weekend .
did n't seem to me like that 's what was going on . you were all over her .
somebody had to do the talking . and by the way , i was right . she 's not married .
none of these are ours . < u > none < /u > of em are ours ... . ... .that 's < u > real politik < /u > , buddy .
waal , i got ta tell you . i 've been inside the beltway fourteen years , and i feel like i just got my feet wet .
woodward 's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing -- absolute page one stuff --
-- in other words , you got nothing , you 're thumbsucking .
she 's the sweetest person i 've ever known . loves kids . works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church . everybody loves her .
i did n't ask you all that , sweet pea . i asked if you loved her .
you -- fooler ... ! did i do good ?
you did great , except there 's just one little thing -- i ca n't work with this paper . it 's corrasable bond , it smudges . maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white , long-grained mimeo .
then say it ... just say it to me ... !
oh yeah , youre a bad girl , baby ... you make me so hot ... im gon na take you to that special place ...
yeah . sociopaths . they 're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that .
but how could he know ? he only just met me .
-- we got a back channel communication from khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal . he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president . i think we 've won .
a thing like this ... who could even think of winning ?
excuse me , sir . i 'd like to have a word with you .
oh ? ... well , quickly please , mothershead , i 'm overdue .
he killed a man worked for him the other night .
so what are you trying to tell me ? i should get out of here ?
there 's nothing on the show i do n't use myself .
and it 's all available in the `` truman '' show '' catalogue . operators are standing by .
damn . just when it was about to get interesting .
it 's okay . she scrambled the transmission . luther , continue feeding the gps her position .
watch it , dipshit . you wan na rip the fuckin ' bag ?
gim me that bag before i knock you out and take it .
and are the police aware you dated the victim ?
what are you saying ? that i killed her or something ?
... i did n't recognize you without the smock . did i -- damn -- did i leave something at the shop ?
no . i might be interested in that , uh , business proposition --
what was that ? i 'm sorry , i did n't catch it . would you repeat it ?
i said : `` are you gon na bark all day , dog , or are you gon na bite . ''
we dumped the whole load . now quit showboating , addison --
i had twenty thousand shares ! i 'd be a millionaire now !
you got a secondary search and you had a gun .
listen it was a calculated risk . i 've done it a million times and never got caught .
poor little grusinskaya ! does it do you good to cry ? are you afraid ? shall i go ?
i was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that . no . i am not afraid . it is strange .
the financials are pretty thorough , so the only thing we do n't know is your fee .
... my fee ? wade , what the heck 're you talkin ' about ?
you 're not going to ... to your room already ?
i 'm very tired . and i 'll have a long drive tomorrow . all the way back to phoenix .
... it 's okay , you should do whatever makes you happy .
alright ... yeah ... thanks for understanding . so i guess ... i 'll see you later .
i 'm afraid this is no time to play cyrano , my friend . what was in your mind ?
i wanted to get things clear for jacqueline . let her know --
i hated to wake you up . how about some breakfast ?
no , thank you . thank you so much .
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum .
well ... perhaps i have `` deviated '' the tiniest bit .
they 'll be coming for laddie and me , wo n't they ?
they 'll be coming for < u > all < /u > of us .
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river ? ?
hey , my friend ! i 'm glad to see your ugly damn face again !
well , okay . i 'll try it . i do n't see the point in it , but i 'll try it . just for you . it 's kind of silly , actually , me going out with an artist in new york city . however ...
good , good , good ... you 'll enjoy it , you 'll see . julian is a gentleman .
that must be raoul ! raoul ! look , d'artagnan 's come to visit ... ! what 's wrong ? you look awful !
michelle , she -- the king has invited her to come live in the palace .
oh , i see . what do you use instead ?
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all .
lawyer says he can plead it down to five years . i 'll serve two .
two years . george , i ca n't wait that long .
that dude who works for valentine . he 's the one sent those guys after you . you know that .
yeah . should n't wonder . must 've done .
michael just got a job . could n't you congratulate him ?
i will , dear . i promise . why mcdonald 's ?
what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for ? should n't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie ?
it 's not about him seeing you in it . it 's how you feel . you 'll feel sexy in lingerie and it 'll show . it 's an inner thing .
it 's saturday night ! there 's still plenty-a action around !
angie , by the time i get clara home , it 's gon na be one , one-thirty . by the time i get home , it 's gon na be two o'clock . i got ta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow .
see ? did n't i tell you she 'd never marry that rotten humperdinck ?
-- yes , you 're very smart . shut-up .
i called sister betty , she did n't tell you ?
since when do you start telling sister betty my business ? since when ? she has nothing to do with this . you tell me , not her , not anybody else .
but your people ... neri ... rocco ; you do n't think ...
no , i have confidence in their loyalty ... but this is life and death , and tom , you are my brother .
sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems .
you know what we should do ? let 's go get in your car right now and just take off ! we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life ... fuck everybody !
no one put me up to anything . i was just hoping i could ask you a couple questions .
of course ! oh , gosh , of course --
what reputation ? you 're nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumbleweed hick .
is that an insult ? are you insulting me .
`` a perfect night for mystery and horror . the air itself is filled with monsters . ''
that 's from your movie , right ? `` the only monsters are here . ''
no , that 's okay , i 'll do it now .
no , baby ... i 'm glad you 're coming tonight .
she 's asleep . i think that 's what i need , too . i 'm starting to see things .
yeah , well i 'll be joining you shortly . i just want to ...
checking out time is three p.m. hotels of this sort are n't interested in you when you come in , but when your time 's up ... sam , i hate having to be with you in a place like this .
i 've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels . they say it ...
that was for my ma . now this is for everybody else .
he 's too important , james . they 'll set the army on you . you and your wife .
there is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room .
the only problem is , it 's up there . we 're down here .
he kidnapped you , kathryn . you saw him murder someone . you knew there was a real possibility he would kill you , too . you were under tremendous emotional stress .
for god sakes , owen , listen to me -- he knew about the boy in fresno and he says three billion people are going to die !
me ? well , i believe in rome ... you 'd have to after what i 've seen , how people outside the empire treat each other .
i do n't even want to imagine the things you 've seen ...
relax , dick , it 's just me ... the desert 's so beautiful , is n't it ? i want to go home , dick . time to go home .
you 're not gon na quit on me , are you , harold ?
samoan jo 's ? yon mean the pub ? hold on . . .
hold on bollocks , no one but card players in here tonight sonny , and i do mean no one .
well , let 's call her up . what can we lose ?
i did n't like her , angie . i do n't feel like calling her up .
a steady job and a few bucks extra , that 's all i wanted .
sure , that 's all right when you 're a kid , but you 'll be pushing thirty pretty soon , slugger . it 's time you got some ambition .
yeah , it took a while before i got a chance to play it , but when i heard that song it was like --
so you really liked it ? yeah , there 's some really rare performances . you liked that memphis minnie , huh ?
whose `` catcher in the rye '' is this ?
well , let 's see now ... if it has my name on it , then i guess it 's mine .
yes -- with all that pressure , and suction within --
there 's no other way . tie my safety line to the sub .
i 'll tell him . what is it ? is it a mine ?
a bomb . at the viaduct . she closes the door , then reappears .
why does rachel wear daddy 's underpants ? does n't she have underpants of her own ?
i noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps rachel 's underpants are in there -- now where are your lunches ?
i must receive proof more conclusive than mr. poe 's opinion before i weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw .
chingachgook 's of the same opinion . taken together , that 's gospel . your fort will stand or fall depending on webb and reinforcements , not these colonials ' presence .
it 's fine . we were just talking about vitamin s .
i 'll go on . ester'1l be very glad .
i hope it ai n't a lot , 'cause i ca n't give you no more credit till the croppin ' season gits back , that is if na --
i did n't say nothin ' 'bout credit , mr. howard .
you do n't understand . you do n't realize how important it is .
important ? of course it 's important . the point is we can do something about it .
you lump them all together -- anglo workers and anglo bosses .
he 's a guest in my house , is n't he ?
i 'd prefer you did n't . i 'm very busy .
okay , then how 'bout we ask you a few questions ?
you 've been doing your homework . look , they ca n't impound it if they do n't know about it .
but they will know about it , burke . from me . just like they 'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
what exactly is the treatment here going to be then ?
it 's quite simple really . were just going to show you some films .
< i > just a box with bright colored paper and the whole thing topped with a bow. < /i >
< i > -- a bow ? -- but why ? -- how ugly ! -- what 's in it ? -- what 's in it ? < /i >
yeah , well we 're still a little young for albany state prison . are you pissed about al ? i 'm pissed too , but i 'm not like `` twenty-five to life '' pissed .
i 'm getting clear of this . if you 're not going to do it for the fucking principle , do it for the money . gordo ?
you do n't remember anything else from that last night you saw him , do you ?
i told the story enough times -- hell , we were just in the car , he was stewing about the fight with buddy while we drove over to roderick bledsoe 's --
surprised you 're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long .
hey , wally . glad you 're here . there was something i wanted to tell you ...
well , look at you , a general , huh ?
oh , well , someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab .
mars ? you 've never even been to mars .
i know it sounds crazy , but i went to this rekall place after work , and ...
she 'll call the cops , they 'll be here before i get unpacked .
so we keep an eye on her . raoul can totally administrate that part .
did you tell them ? that we were coming ?
do n't you think it 's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents ?
no , please ; an advance on your salary .
mon general , i have come here to learn and to give , not to take . i am serving without salary .
he insulted me first . he called me a moron .
did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way ?
yes , i did -- but you tricked me into signing it ! you told me my soul was nothing ... that i could forget all about a soul , in exchange for money . that was a lie , a lie , a lie .
that is highly irrelevant to this case , your honor .
wo n't work , we 're just gon na have to chance it man . i 'm sorry .
no . sorry comes later , when you 're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis . sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection , sorry --
i ca n't ... they prefer a more formal presentation . i do n't usually go so close to the surface , but i was ...
... you are so goddamn weird . oh , and by the way , get the hell outta here !
you coulda picked up a tab every once in a while .
i did ! i paid for half the fuckin drinks !
just tell me where i can find him , friend .
comes right in this poolroom every night , eight o'clock on the nose . just stay where you are . he 'll find you .
kalen ... do you have any idea where they take them ?
we 're not supposed to think about it . but i dream about it sometimes ...
i do n't know how to fish , louise .
neither do i , thelma , but darryl does it , how hard can it be ? i 'll see you later . be ready .
nay , jack , tis not what you 're thinking .
i trust our own welcome will be more hospitable .
least , < u > they < /u > wo n't feed any comanches this winter ... killin ' buffalo 's as good as killin ' injuns in this country .
peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo , too ... .
you know . your love machine ... the throbbing thrill hammer ... your thing !
you mean my wang ? listen , it 's running real late .
and what is so alarming about the tower , miss connell ?
nothing -- really . but you must admit it 's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone . if you were n't digging up a girl who died six years ago . a girl no one even remembers .
mary anne mathews , that was her name . her mom remembers her .
you do n't need coffee , mr. fazeli ; you need a vacation . sheila catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot . she puts a ken head earring in her right ear . buzz follows sheila 's gaze .
some people will do anything for an autograph . theo enters the diner and walks over to buzz .
what do you mean ? where did she go ?
how would i know ? gone . girlfriend . leave . not say where gone . laura move out .
it should all in the report . i told you guys everything . she was giving birth in the fucking car . she grabbed the wheel and i lost control .
i did read that , yes . what hospital were you going to ? i mean the lodovico street bridge is n't exactly on the way to mercy general .
the building has been occupied and the locks have been changed .
the university can not do this . is the room safe ?
i do n't really know what happened in woodsboro , sid . but i know you do n't trust me .
it 's not you , derek . i do n't trust myself . i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men .
now you 've done it . you 've given me nervous indigestion . anything else bothering you , boys ?
just one little thing . how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson would n't get out of the forest ?
i 'm a delta gamma and i 'm a huge fan of yours !
you took my class in la . you had the best high kick i 've ever seen . are you one of my lawyers ?
and whose fault is that ? if we 'd won in vietnam ...
it 's nobody 's fault , jack . it 's change -- which is a fact of history . even that old cocksucker hoover 's dead . things change .
then explain it , whatever it is . it could save the voyage . i 've spent years planning this . my entire fortune .
you 'd persist at the cost of your own life ? the lives of your crew ?
i 'm working my ass off here . i 've taken care of absolutely everything keith .
because you wanted to . you wanted this to be your wedding not your parent 's .
six years ago . baltimore . you grabbed a kid at francis public pool in the west end .
did i ? i do n't recall ... i got lots of kids from that place --
well -- no . i did n't . why ?
nothing . i just wondered . no *reason* to take it up with him. `` -- about a quarter of a mile on either side of willet creek -- ''
i 'm sorry . i ca n't sit with you .
i understand . maybe we 'll see each other after the show ...
schnickelfritz ! i told you schnickelfritz ! why 'd you make me bet on equipoise !
i clocked him this morning . he was running like a doll .
there 's still time , take me up on my offer .
i 'm not leaving you alone with these assholes .
okay . so is that a yes or a no ?
i think i was very clear , ted . if everything else falls apart , maybe .
you got ta tell your story to the police .
police ? why police ? das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen . no , no . it is all nonsense ; it was an accident .
do n't you worry , captain . we 'll beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push .
i hope it wo n't come to that , mr. scott .
... me ? well , you could 've saved yourself the trip .
i know where the blame belongs . but i did n't put you in prison , andrew . the government did ...
like what are you going to do on your honeymoon ?
we 've been discussing that . he wants to go to the riviera - but i sort of lean toward niagara falls .
oui . perhaps i called at a bad time . i am sorry .
no . i just got distracted . i 'm so sorry .
it 's not like he has n't made us wait a few times .
well , you are n't the president , dear .
ligature strangulation , just like his victims . a cord , nylon , you can tell by the indentation signature -- again , like his victims . look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in . should have cut it off .
i 'm not in the mood for native american wisdom .
privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies .
did you come here with wally -- to *not* watch movies ?
i 'm not so sure the goddam thing 's in his heart .
'course it is n't , but how many chances do we get to go to japan ? with our golf clubs .
there 's hope and promise in it , jabez -- planting and promise of good harvest to come .
yes -- you are right , mary . i can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- all the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
people with sense can belong wherever they 're put .
can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week 's salary in the bank ? if only she was ordinary .
we 're a long way from home and we 're in a bad place . let 's not make it worse . if anyone has any constructive suggestions , now is the time .
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity , that should prevent another power drain .
you ca n't feel it when it 's in your hand , when it 's in your pocket .
max , what is it ? what are you doing ? what 's happening ?
you knew the arm slash was not `` zorro . ''
i suspected , but you were the one low contacted . that 's why i brought you back here .
that 's a hell of a swing you got there , noel . i 'm thinking strawberry in his prime .
strawberry ai n't shit . drug pussy . me . i swing like reggie . mr. october . number three , game six , world series .
if we were to go to trial , would we win the case ?
well , of course , it 's always dangerous ...
if the crone 's wound bled hard , that means she was not killed by the hessian . someone only tried to make it look that way .
you grow sharper by the minute , little man . it boggles my mind , but i begin to prefer your company over all others .
they 'll pull us right down i tell ya !
aw knock it off , yer scarin ' me . come on girls , grab your oars . let 's go . well come on !
god , i hate falling asleep in the afternoon . now i 'll be up all night ... ... ugh , my back is killing me .
yeah , hey how far do you think we are from your dad 's ?
you mean , what 's in that thing is immortal ?
i do n't know . that 's the point .
you should n't say that , you 're the chairman -- ... uh , chairperson ...
and here i am , just standing here . that 's terrible . thank you .
too many . and you 've got a new guest . a movie star from hollywood .
shucks . and my autograph book is at the cleaners .
they 're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who 's got more than ten cents in his pocket . they 're -
the trouble is , mr. thatcher , you do n't realize you 're talking to two people .
i always thought it was the work of a serial killer . anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again . and again . until someone stopped him .
that your ... `` theory '' , ai n't that what they call it ?
we can do this . we can get her out of here .
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you do n't think at some point somebody might notice that she 's gone ?
the thing is , chick . i 'm goin ' down .
down . you mean jail ? for that credit card stuff ? for chrissake , bernie , your lawyer ...
reminds me of a young doctor i used to know ...
they 're running me ragged . nothing but question day and night ... i love it ! come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it . there 's a bajoran band at the officer 's mess .
you 'd think a guy who 's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl .
i have n't been able to get you off my mind .
you did what ? who did you talk to ? what for ?
well , i 'm only trying to get you outta this . i told them you were in vietnam , you always had good jobs , you were with goldwater at the '64 convention , but you had marital problems ...
i may be an old fool , but i think we can help you .
i hope so . at least i got to see you and grandma . has it ever worked before ?
and i know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city .
i guess you know just about everything , do n't you , lance ?
i 'm not interested . i 've already got a job .

and you , if you had come out of egypt , you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the golden calf .

i 'm a cybernetic organism . living tissue over a metal endoskeleton .
this in intense . get a grip , john . okay , uh ... you 're not here to kill me ... i figured that part out for myself . so what 's the deal ?
fine , we 're fine in the circumstances . but i can guess what you 've called about . there 's nothing we can do ; they wo n't reopen the station --
yes , i know , but jurek , jurek ...
do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case ?
i 'm not a stalker ! she 's a friend of mine .
her husband works a night shift or something , and he comes home , and i 'm on the floor with my cock in his wife 's ass .
jesus , jack . jesus . and you walked all the way back from solvang ?
you can sleep on the bed if you want .
well ... i 'm not gon na put you out of your bed ...
and this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it .
lamar , i 'm sorry . i do n't know what --
and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs , i would give you a good spanking -- in a business way , of course .

contract players at metro . you pinch 'em . i do you up feature in the next issue . plus the usual fifty cash . tell me , am i fucking santa claus ?
i need an extra fifty . two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at hollywood station .
but think of all the poor devils who can not meet renault 's price . i get it for them for half . is that so parasitic ?
i do n't mind a parasite . i object to a cut-rate one .
then why does n't he simply appoint me to the post ?
mozart , you are not the only composer in vienna .
sure , but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record !
well , it 's done now -- what 's the use of grousing about it . forget the letter , amy , i just had to blow off some steam ...
maybe bellmoth . maybe the unions . i do n't know .
well until we find , you 're gon na have to take a leave of absence .

i 'm sorry she 's not feeling well enough to receive you today .
i heard sir te lost something . and now madame te 's not feeling well ...
aye , well , if all you want is a good opinion then he 'd be sure to oblige you .
what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit , a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming . literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson .
and what were the consequentialities of european culture you did n't bother with ?
the bible . monarchy . many wrong ideas about the government of men . my father 's people already know each man is his own nation . and only he can have dominion over himself . not kings . no man is better than any other man .
but i can run much faster than you ... i am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second ...
data ... have n't you ever just played ... for fun ?
is that what you call it ? `` < i > real < /i > '' ?
at least it beats living in a lab like somebody 's science project .
joe -- do you mean to say -- do you think you can actually *handle* this -- this whatever-you-call-it in washington ?
a young patriot ? -- who recites jefferson and lincoln ? -- turned loose in our nation 's capital ? i think i can .
i think i 'd probably like the apple business .
you 're a little overqualified , are n't you ?
okay . pretty petty party , is n't it , pal ?
i made one rule for myself when this started and i realized i was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports ...
you 've got to trust me . i 'm putting my daughter 's life in your hands . she 's only six . she 's just a little girl . please , please , trust me .
it 's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances .
i 'll do more than tell you . i 'll show you , back at my place . if you 'll just do me one little favor first .
okay , what is it ? you want a ride ?
we could use ... his computer , to ... just e-mail those suckers right ou ...
tomorrow is sunday . nobody 's doing business . crack of dawn , monday , walter 'll take you up there ...
do n't try to bamboozle me , colonel . has another scientist been kidnapped or not ?
well , yes sir . a professor morton , but with just a little more time , sir , i can assure you a breakthrough on this case ...
stigma ? larry ! billion buys you some slack in this world .
and the kid who wrote skywire -- then gave it away ? they 're calling him the digital robin hood .
look , the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group . those that can shoot , protect the rest to his ride .
hey , when this plan completely goes to shit , what are ya gon na do ?
jesus christ , guys . what the hell 's khruschev thinking ?
did you have any indication of this from georgi ? any possible warning or sense of motivation ?
quite so . narcissus and his courageous men ; may they live long to serve rome ...
and caesar ! let 's not forget to serve caesar !
i ca n't ... they do n't operate that way ...
fuck how they operate . just do it . like your man says , `` by any means necessary . ''
ed , you 're still young . this is the part of your life when you 're < u > supposed < /u > to be struggling .
i know ... but sometimes i get scared this is as good as it 's gon na get ...
why ? it 's such a simple thing . you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again .
they 'll just catch you again , francie . besides , your mother will know .
sidney , do you have any idea how he could 've gotten your number ?
he could 've monitored the calls on a scanner . did you call her from the set ?
why was < u > she < /u > exempted , nick ?
maybe whatever they are , they just have n't appeared yet on her ?
sir , someone mentioned you received the navy cross . may i ask what you got it for ?
for pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi arabia .
what else , stupid ! you do n't think we 're after that penny-ante reward , do you ? ten thousand bucks ? chicken feed ! we 're holding her for a million smackers .
say , look ! i did n't know it was anything like this , seeand
are n't you going to switch exits on him again ?
why ? the crocks are all going for the dead crock . there 's no fun in it . besides we 've got plenty more for them . the night is young ... .
... you 're saying that when he first appeared at your house , you had no idea he was jewish ... .
none whatsoever . but i have to admit , i 'm not terribly surprised .

in cluett 's apartment ? well dear , you see , i . . . i . . .
you 're an artist , wladek , you keep people 's spirits up . you do enough .
but i want to help , i want to .
back up . how do you know he 's gay ?
gay men know designers . straight men do n't .
do n't shoot me , i 'm friendly . you can use that when you surrender .
how do you say `` come here , baby . i 'm horny . '' i can use that now .
what ? that 's just gordon 's bad taste .
why could n't he have just told you all these things ?
maybe i 'm wrong ... maybe we 're not ready yet . in south africa the numbers were small ...
the government 's afraid , and they do n't know what to do . but they 're more afraid of terrorists than of you . the viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence .
a dollar seventy and i 'm gon na keep it !
no , you 're not . give me that dollar seventy .
i came on my own . after reading about the bombing in dallas .
well , if you 've got something to tell me , you 've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab ...
it has n't been laid out , we have n't finished with the embalming . as a matter of fact , you 're looking at it . the remains of margo channing . sitting up . it is my last wish to be buried sitting up .
would n't you feel more natural taking a bow ?
look , eventually , everybody gets one ... some of em take a couple seconds ... ... some of em take a lot longer ...
i asked you a direct question ! a glimpse of what ? !
you going to pull a big gulp with that ?
no , but if you 're nice i 'll let you buy me a slurpee . you know your 7-11speak pretty well .
you know what i hate ? any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they 're god .
you know what i hate ? it 's always the assholes that pass the tests .
that 's what i 'm here for -- to get out ! i want to get away from here , from you -- as fast as i can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me . sixty-five , ninety-four --
do n't you < u > realize < /u > --
now that you mention it , i sure would like to call my aunt up in portland and tell 'er where i am so she can come visit me .
all in good time , mister mcmurphy . all in good time .
i thought i 'd invest in a film . i want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film , meet the people who make films , learn how it 's done ...
in other words , you want to get laid ?
no . i want to show you . is it ruined ?
well , water is n't exactly the best thing for pictures ... not even for pictures of dolphins ...
well , we are one miracle short tonight . so , just guard the stairs ?
done . but you 're locked in . will you hold the keys ?
so ? i heard you had a good bunch of killers here .
and i do n't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman nung river . you say you do n't know kurtz ?
if you 're hiding something ... oh , oh , i 'll have so much fun .
why do you hate me ? it 's got ta be more than me private you , you cop .
you 're not `` protecting '' anyone . these people 's lives may depend on the answers you give . these are all former associates of dr. manhattan --
then why do n't you ask him ? ! ?
i ca n't believe i remembered that , although i suppose i should . i wrote it ... but that was seven years ago , and you 're quoting it verbatim . i 'm flattered ... i think . or frightened . what 's your name ?
betty sizemore . what do you mean you wrote it ?
we 're into the second perimeter . they 'll be coming out to blast us shortly . i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in ?
check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures . both of you will have to learn ...

oh , how fortunate i am to have lowell bergman 's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path . to show me the way .

`` oh , tract housing , huh ? '' laugh . `` you need a new real estate agent . ''
`` beg to differ . this casket incarpratates , er , inporporates -- ''
yes , but i 'm going to live at home .
remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code . i 'm sure you 're going to be very happy there .
you bet you should have called . you still live at home . do n't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning , do n't make me call hospitals .
dad , i 'm so sorry . i know this is a bad time .
what was that all about ? i thought everything must go !
oh yeah right , like i 'm gon na let some asshole with a goatee own goofy gus .
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours , there are simply more of them tightly packed . his knowledge is probably limitless..

buddy 's in a bad mood -- prostate problems .
he 's always in a bad mood . count ya blessin 's . ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
during your second act scene with your father , roger ferraday 's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch . he 's been coming closer down every night ...
when he gets too close , i 'll spit in his eye .

seein 's how you 're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss , do n't know how you can criticize .
pete , i 'm so sorry about what they did to you . i did n't think you 'd come back , i thought you 'd want to write again ...
dell , i ca n't write unless i 'm happy , and i ca n't be happy unless i 'm here -- and with you . this is me , delly . pete appleton . and i love you !
fine , if you do n't want us , stay with the scum in present management -- dedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground .
... that `` scum '' built this company up from one plane in thirty years , they made something out of nothing , and if that 's a scum i 'll take one over a rat any day ...
sure . how much does the job pay ? sure , if there 's a chance for advancement .
you would n't consider going over niagara falls without a barrel ?

ninotchka , you know i am your friend , you can trust me ... . did you bring back anything else ?
i hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered . now did anyone , including you , actually see her murdered ?
doyle -- are you interested in solving a case , or making me look foolish ?
i believe that your tone implied that there was some < u > good < /u > news ... . and , do you know ... there might be good news for < u > you < /u > ...
oh , yes , what ? you 'd < u > bribe < /u > me , to , to , to , `` release '' you ... ?
i warned you civil defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate .
i just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted .
i 'm clementine . can i borrow a piece of your chicken ?
and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers .
i do n't get it -- you were the one who wanted to fire him .
i know , i did , but damnit howard -- for the first time since i 've known him , i think he 's really humping ...
i work here , sir . im here most of the time .
you wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together , would you ?
i told you i did n't want to mix in it .
all right , brother . then you can go to some nice warm place , and i do n't mean california .
would n't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature .
so , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand-boy . and if you refused , it was n't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . that 's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege .
when she 's ready you bring her to me -- i 'll show her how .
dr. macfarlane , i wonder if you know what happiness you 've brought those people .
yes . it 's the same as usual . nothing remarkable about it at all .
i have to call the client and give them a reason why you 're late .
i do n't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children .
oh ... oh ... oh ! i think ... maybe ... one of 'em ... was foster ... but i do n't hardly know him !

helena , please . this is out of your hands .
i know i made things worse . i know that and i 'm sorry , but arnie i need something from you . something only you can help me with .
i never wanted to be a mom . then , sharing it with you was one thing . carrying it alone , the rest of my life ...
is scary . but you want it . gim me some truth here .
ca n't you understand -- i got tired of being a woman . i wanted the respect that only a cape , boots , chestplate , and a mechanical spear can bring..
you 're not strong . you 're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you . whatever the cult of good was , it 's not anymore ... you do n't have to listen to me , just listen to you..
the thing that 's so irritating is that now i 'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses .
you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity ?

he 's a pretty tough old man , huh ?
yes , i called him right away . he says it 's nothing to worry about .
is she running a temperature ? what is it ?
and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out . from the wembley staduim job , was n't it ? pink floyd concert receipts . jenny would 've been ... fourteen at the time ?
hardly buried . earning interest , love . earning interest in an offshore account . tidy little premium per annum , that .
it 's been a while . maybe i 'm just out of practice .
then lem me remind you , the polite thing is to say , thank you , that 's a real nice offer , i do n't mind taking you up on it .
no , you dumb son of a bitch . i 'm serious . i 'm disappearing .
where to ? morgan stanley ? rehab ? what ?
and current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you 're talking about , even for a fraction of a second , would require more energy than our sun produces in a year , is that correct ?
i do n't have the figures in front of me , but yes , that sounds about right .
now there 's a few who could have been his seed-mother .
only a few ? you 're just not trying .
a girl has to have a bit of glamour .
absolutely . long as she can keep it . is n't that right , james ...
melvin ... i 'd like to know exactly where we are going .
just south to baltimore , maryland . so i know what you 're going to ask next . that you might ask -- i 'm not certain .
it 's just like swimming , norman ... you know how to swim , do n't you ?
you 're not afraid of the water , are you , norman ?
why ? why he have to ask ? ca n't nobody offer ? what 's going on ? since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog ? !
unrile yourself , stamp . it 's only a few days he been there .
give me a goddam break . i 'm not going to go anywhere alone .
and i 'm going to make sure of it . give me your wrist .
but with this place , i - - i wanted to give them something real , something that was n't an illusion , something they could see and touch . an aim devoid of merit .
but you ca n't think through this one . you have to feel it .
jeebs is eager to have me deport him . but would rather kill himself than go downtown . why ?
i dunno . why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner ? .
oh , you did ? i did n't know that .
yeah . he 's just a friend of mine i was trying to help , so ... so what ?
... '' find the need and fill it '' my dad used to say -- i guess a lot of dads say that -- but i did and it just took off .
no kidding ... panda . where 'd that come from ?
because there 's no way a girl could have killed them .
that is so sexist . the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct .
huh ? -- what 's that ? well -- what about it ? who cares , anyhow ?
i do -- and i think you should too .
well , she 's got to be < u > somewhere < /u > here .
no one 's been in or out since you left . would 've heard the dogs .
why is she so desperate to kiss us ? i 'm betting her lips are poison .
a poison kiss ? you have some real issues with women , you know that ? you just could n't stand that she was about to kiss me . could n't stand that something might be mine and not yours . could you ? !
it wo n't work , he 'll know it 's a trap ...
reilly , you 're done for now . what the hell were you thinking directing the bomb squad team into hot pursuit . they had no business-
your son ... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the fox network . < b > int . cigliuti compound -- master bedroom -- next < /b > cigliuti sits up in bed .
my frances ? frances and charles have been kidnapped ? < b > ext . nevada desert -- next < /b >
forget it ... how 'bout covering a little philosophical ground ? life , death , life ... things of that nature ?
i did not have time on vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines .
was n't too tough , buddy . game happened almost thirty years ago .
what are you talking about ? i 'm talking about this afternoon .
you want a number for a psychiatrist , i can get you one , that 's not a problem . but what exactly is wrong ?
i do n't know if there 's anything wrong with me because i do n't know how other people are ... ..sometimes i cry a lot ... ..for no reason .
i 'm grateful , frank . how much ? for the singer .
i thought maybe twenty percent . look , with the additional bookings we 'll come out ahead . the big hotels , they want a pretty girl with a big voice . we have to stay competitive , jack .
man , after taxes , lawyer fees , and paying off my daddy 's bad credit , we did n't end up with a million . we bought this house and i spent the rest on this . it 's the bomb , huh ?
this my baby . i feel like a new nigga in this car . i get mo ' phone numbers rollin ' this , than i ever did on the bus .

yeah . it depends . cause like this one time with eric , when we got blasted at his house . and smash j and dj flipper was there ...
you 're conning me , sweetheart . i ai n't responsible for no baby .
then why do you think i married frank ? i was already pregnant , and i did n't have much time . say what you like , but at least he gave my kid a name .
and your own gas cooker ? that 's marvelous ! naturally it 's not the royal suite ...
sssh ! once and for all , we 're in moscow !
what < u > about < /u > a crowbar ?
what if we go out there , you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open .
of course ! not only go to it but go to it in full uniform ! rent a uniform !
that 's against the law , is n't it ? i ca n't wear a uniform anymore .
no , no , no , not at all .
uh , well , i 'd like to talk to you about that sometime , if you get a chance .
why ? god alone knows what it means . until it has proven value , it 's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick . hardly fit for the classroom .
but the possibilities . combining ancient knowledge with new ? something like this could change our fundamental views !
look , we 've all made chamber runs to this depth . we 're checked out .
oh ... chamber runs . uh huh , that 's good . well , hey ... you guys know any songs ?
we heard firing . he get anybody ? you alone ?

listen to me , cocksucker . there is no keyser sate . if you say his name again , i'11 kill you right here .
a strange threat . i can only assume you 're here to kill me anyway . pity about mr. redfoot .
nothing . no sign of ganz . no sign of the indian . airport 's clean . train station . bus station . docks ... shit ...
ganz is going to be hard to track . just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed ... totally without any pattern ... kill anybody ... the indian ... himself ... anybody ...
i have n't lost a bill in eighteen years , do n't jinx me , walt .
i think treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government .
you spoke with this wallace in private . what kind of man is he ?
... a mindless barbarian . not a king like you , m'lord .
i can keep a victim alive for weeks ... months , if i desire it ... it 's an art . they beg for death ... i keep it just out of their reach . the pain remains constant .
do n't please ... i 'll do what you desire ...
well . there 's your life form reading . these were microbes on the tube 's surface . we shot them here from enterprise . they were fruitful , and multiplied .
but ... how could they have evolved so quickly ... ?
i hope so . i am not looking forward to another stretch .
i made a mistake . i 'll never make another one .
you know , go to the tonk or whatever .
i 'm too old for you . besides , i 'm not much in the mood .
he 's going to help the police . your daddy is going to be a hero .
my daddy is going to be a hero ? like power rangers ?
that cardboard headstone tipped over . this graveyard is obviously phony !
people wo n't notice . filmmaking is n't about picky details -- it 's about the big picture .
he 's lyin ' mama . he ai n't gon na do better .
i know honey . just remember what i said , we 'll bide our time . you just steer clear of him as much as you can . doyle 's had a real hard life . it 's just about run him crazy i think .
taylor - get your ass over here . move !
hang tough , gator . hang in there , man , you 're gon na be ok ... just hang on .
maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his yater .
he did n't look like he 'd take that sitting down .

oh ... well alright , you can be red if you want .
not now , slink . i 've got some bad news .
when i 'm sober . they get a little mixed up when i 'm drunk . most of the time they 're mixed up .

why , it has just made me ill , buddy . i 'm sick . i do n't want to eat nothin ' , i do n't , and me i got a good appetite , that ai n't nat'ral for me . i 'm ill .
but , rose , what is the cause of it all ?
all right , so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look . okay ? you happy ? so now what ?
so now you 've got to talk him out of it . and then we 've got to figure out an acceptable political solution .
then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together , so that it works like that whip of yours . you know that , do n't you ?
i 've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man .
there is an alternative to an all- out assault . isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them .
we 'd have to tag every one of them ... that would take time ... and we do n't have it . the enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the federation ...
look here , the mountain man . you 're walker , right ?
good memory . you must be great with numbers .
for a man who talks a great deal , it 's amazing how unenlightening you can be .
there are some things , my dear conway , i deeply regret i may not discuss .
yeah , i got eyes . i put things together .
i remember once when you did n't quite `` put things together '' . boy ! was the mayor mad !
no , you can find some other way . explain it to me . bree , show me any sense to --
you get the christ out ! you dumb stupid bastard , you do n't know anything , you square , you get out ! i do n't have to show you anything ; you get out !
they have n't been tough on me . i just lost my money . but when i compare these last ten years with the twenty i spent with him -
i feel kind of sorry for him , all the same -
reilly , what 's happening ? reilly ! reilly ! do not engage . we 're five minutes-
we 'll keep him pinned in , you guys hurry up !
i thought you were mrs. gaskell 's hobby , tripp .
piss off , crabs . i lost a wife today .
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork . what is your expertise , sir , are you a detective of sorts ?
my expertise . is that i 'm a journalist .
i know alexander . his imagination must be struck by some great , bold , powerful stroke , and he will come back to me , just as he did at friedland .
with his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs , on a ten mile front , in the forests , bordering the banks of the vistula river , napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance , disguised in the uniform of a polish lancer .
i could give it some thought , ben , but my leg is very sore .
... oh ? robert , take a look , would you ?
sam , get the body and put it in the van . sheriff cable , where were you the night teresa banks was murdered ?
my alibi is as strong as these bands of steel .
do n't you remember ? we were at the office party together --
oh , yes -- office party -- miss olsen --
he was blowin ' his lines , all right . so what ?
so what ? he 's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule !
your majesty . this ball , with an open invitation to the nobility of paris -- we have no way of checking --
you will protect me as you always have , d'artagnan .
get real . i was useful to damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on . now that it 's over , all bets are off .
if that 's true , then why 'd you save me ?
i 'm satisfied with my situation for now . you do n't hear me bitching . you , on the other hand , have been bitching all day .
thank you . why do n't you go back to the video store ?
you 're gon na be sorry you did n't listen to me .
you 're gon na be sorry if you do n't shut the fuck up .
the jacket , tripp . we need the jacket .
oh , right . oola . about that jacket ...
no , benjamin . i do n't hate him . unhook my blouse .
well how do you feel about him , then ?
my grandboy 's been eatin ' a ton of breakfast every day . been out riding . must be the good air . you oughta see that little booger eat . i 'll bet he 's gained ten pounds . molly 's out in the motor home ...
i know ... 'out in the good air ... '
here 's what i think ... i think these mokes below are a hit sqaud .
i saw these guy perform ... at altmont ... you know that ? they opened for the stones ...
i do n't know what it 's called , father , all i know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again .
that 's not proven , in fact , it is only in the experimental stage at this moment .
apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders is n't as popular as we thought it 'd be . representative taylor is working on a compromise .
put together a score sheet . i 'll make some calls .
so you said at the time . speaking of which , your protg 's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
she 's half romulan , jim . the admixture makes her more volatile than -- me , for example .
maybe cavello 's buying a subaru . how would i know ?
i do n't blame you for being sore . it 'll pass when we bag him .
you do n't usually talk to anyone when you 're hurting .
it was my fault . i was right downstairs . i should have gone up with him .
yes , i was given a few , but i never had time to wear them ...
still , pretty wealthy for a peasant girl would n't you say ?
finch , listen -- stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your mocash-chino or whatever . it 's fast acting . i mean < u > really < /u > fast .
first of all , it 's < u > mocha < /u > ccino , and secondly ... oohhhh !
i did n't know you knew who picasso was , gus .
i 'm a smart sonofabitch . i just hide it .
go away . go to that girl of yours .
look , i was making that up because i thought the whole thing was a mistake . i did n't want to hurt you . you 've been good to me . you 're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me .
i am raymond . thank you for allowing us to stay here .
no problem , man . hey , you wan na hit ?
you 've sacrificed ? ! if you 'd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents --
they need help , lil . they pay me back in other ways .
oh , i love that . i 'm just great . i 'm so happy to be here . and i apologize for invading you . and i 'm so happy you asked me to . i 'm so touched . i know how private you and sally are .
yeah , well , it 's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends .
sure . i would n't blame you , either .
who 's the guy she 's gon na marry ?
we ca n't go back there . are you crazy ? you saw --
it 's the only way . it 's possible your father may not be dead yet .
but i just became a private citizen . i can go anywhere i want to .
with id and a gun ... ? impersonating a federal agent is a felony .
none of your business , but it 's in the cab . that 's all mine . when we take from them , we divide , eighty-twenty .
at those prices i 'd just as soon your cabbie did n't get a look at me .
he wo n't see us ... we 'll just stalk him from a distance .
i 'm afraid if i see him , i 'll start feeling really bad again .
hijacked a prison transport , made a helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down .
okay , maybe that 's a < u > good < /u > thing . maybe i can use him to help with --
your name is < u > beetle juice < /u > ? yecch ! that 's as bad as < u > deee < /u > lia < u > deee < /u > tz .
it 's spelled different , but basically ... now you said it twice ; just one more time , and i 'll be free . and then < u > you 'll < /u > be free .
dr. lecter , when there 's time i 'll -
we do n't reckon time the same way , clarice . this is all the time you 'll ever have .
every seat for the opening has been sold at vienna . sold out for three days .
i know -- i know -- but it will be sunny in tremezzo . we 'll have a guest then .
no ! i do n't want fop ! goddamnit - i use dapper dan !
watch your language , young fellow , this is a public market . now , if you want dapper dan i can order it for you , have it in a couple of weeks .
yes . why disguise your voice if no one knows it ?
i was thinking the same thing . he must be local . it 's logical for him to assume that the police would be there , but he recognized andy 's voice and called him by name . what about this ?
mueller . he 's as bad as west and we both know it . now i ca n't do it , cause i 'm tied up , but we get the others to go along --
i do n't think i want to hear this --
you want me to wait til you 've quit the building ?
yes i do . you do n't want to lie without what it 's absolutely necessary .
hurry up on that trap . what are you trying to do , sefton ? gum up the works ?
that 's right . or would you rather see dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like manfredi and johnson ?
oh , that 'dukes of hazzard ' show , there was probably ninety-five people there , maybe more .
see what i mean ? it 's a funny business , is n't it ?
including killaine ... i still ca n't think of you that way .
i told you my father died in jail . he stole a fortune . most of it pretty dirty money . i do n't care to have that known .
buddy , they revoked the deal , they pulled it ...
they what ? what ? no . no . why ?
you see , major , at this very moment , while we sit and chat , a decision is being made by the president in the war room . he knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes .
but when they do , sir , wo n't they hit back with everything they 've got ?
you know , that was a good thing you did for clarence , in class today . i believed his story , but i was afraid the other children would n't ...
he was real scared nobody would believe him -- i could tell , even when he first stood up .
get this , frank -- we got two patients . number one , the scarecrow outside . number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony , then throws himself through a glass window , heads to the bedroom , where he 's now passed out .
well , he 's the steakhead of the night , then .
miss scarlett . in the broom closet . with the radio .
i got ta go . i 'll see you at work . walter , you scared me . do n't ever do that again .
tell him how you feel -- you miss him . tell him you 're sorry .
ok , all right . telephone 's in the hall . dial his number .
when was the last time you talked to your son ?
... .i dunn ... o ... .maybe ten ... five , fuck , fuck ... .that 's another thing that goes --
look , jack , if you make everything your personal responsibility , you 'll turn into a bad cop . it 's not a practical way to function ...
i did n't get burned , two cops did . listen , i 'll tell you about personnel responsibility . i like to get the job done right . and if i do n't get my job done right ... i 'm for shit .
well , first off , if you were glenn , you would n't be thinking .
remember snoopy miller , his old pal from lompoc ?
but ... where is dunois ... where are the men the king promised me ?
he never sent them ... do n't you understand ? he does n't want this war anymore ... he has his crown now , that 's all he ever wanted ...
yeah . i 'm gon na get my ... i 'm gon na get my camera .
you know , i-i think ... if i could pry this door off ... we shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they do n't have legs . they do n't run around .
lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas . trouble is they 're little , they ai n't got much say-so .
shore looks like my lucky day , anyway . gettin ' some work at las ' .
so the whole idea of selling the house -- do n't get me wrong , i 'd be glad to move to some better place , but if they are n't gon na pay us properly , i just do n't see the point .
yeah , i can see that . i guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems are n't important , but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff ?
ever since i found that thing i 've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare . you have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time .
your nightmares are over . i 'm taking this back to argo city where it wo n't be misused . you could come too . it might be safer for you .
now there you are completely wrong . if we sit down for a little chat , i 'm sure we wo n't run out of conversation and what 's more it wo n't be dull .
madame , what is it you people always say , regardless of what you mean ... `` i am delighted to have you here '' ? i have not reached that stage of civilization .
i do n't know -- how would i know ?
i 'm afraid i already know a great many people . until one of them dies i could n't possibly meet anyone else .
hey , you just got a five thousand dollar raise . get a car of your own .
you know you 've got nothing but cars down there in impound .
okay , look . i 'm going to work really , really hard on this one . but , please stop with the pressure . i 'm already tense as it is .
it 's cool . it 's cool . aveenooh shalom alechem , brother .
so you do n't want to hear my new ending ?
you 'll read it in class tomorrow . surprise me . anyway , i have to go . i promised melinda i 'd help her with her oral .
i do n't know , either . i want to find out . i 've never been hit , have you ?
no . that 's a good thing , is n't it ?
goddammit , i do n't need this aggravation . i 'll shoot you , ben . bank on it .
i do n't want to hurt you , sam .
what is it ? is something wrong , doctor ?
listen ! do n't you hear that strange music ?
this guy must have been a real pain in your dick .
literally . it 's not a bad deal , gentleman . i get peace of mind . you get detective sheilds . but this is the best part , walter ... walter , your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile . capice ?
listen . do you want to go to jail ? taking evidence , tampering with a crime scene . you know what they 'd do .
he would have done it to us , right ?
jon , i do not want to hear it .
i 'm sorry . look -- there 's a gas storm on the valles marineris . . .
i know the theory behind the movement . if one believes in good one believes in evil . if one believes in god , one must believe in the devil . and an intelligent person can make his own choice  that 's it , is n't it ?
because you are intelligent -- that 's why they sent me to you --
that 's what makes you interesting . as a teacher .
god , i would love to think i 'm an interesting teacher . i mean , i had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all .
i know , i liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict ! she gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she 's little miss perfect and everybody loves her .
it 's totally sickening . let 's see if they gave me the right diploma ...
i ... liz ... all i ever wanted , was for you to be happy . i just wanted to give you the wedding , the life you always dreamed of ... ... i just love you so much ... so much ...
you and moore move the bodies and bury boyd with them . in fact , put moore in the ground too .
aha ! i 'd been getting a female vibe . good . speak on , dear friend .
she 's someone i just ca n't -- someone who ... self-evidently ca n't be mine -- and it 's as if i 've taken love-heroin -- and now i ca n't even have it again . i 've opened pandora 's box . and there 's trouble inside .
justice , yes . paid , i do n't know . they like the idea , but my hands are tied with budget restraints .
but i 'll get my normal fee , right ?
sheriff 's gold posse ... bunch of damn fools who pay $ 5,000 apiece to the sheriff 's reelection . i let 'em practice up out here .
yeah . do you remember the last time you talked to mulwray ?
we started this together , and we 're staying together , so there 's no point in splitting things up now .
what if we get separated ? way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share .
i 'm well aware of this asinine article . and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper .
it says that this company has heavily fascist ties to the french secret army organization that tried to assassinate de gaulle in .
maybe you should go out with him . if you keep avoiding him he 'll get suspicious . besides , what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who 's investigating you .
the thing is , i really like him . i finally meet a guy i really like and i 'm a fuckin ' werewolf .
now , marietta , i am goin ' to help you . and do n't be gettin ' carried away . you do n't want to be bringin ' santos and his people into it .
you 're just jealous of santos cause he 's sweet on me .
you have n't driven in years , you ai n't even got a license . man 's taking his life in his hands , putting you behind the wheel ! where you taking him ?
greenville . we 're picking up the new superintendent at the bus station .
how dare you ? my father is the british museum 's most respected archeologist !
do they have him on display at the weekends ?
he 's not dead . it 's a heroin overdose . break out the narcon .
he 's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight . then , lord willing , we 'll try to bring him back .
chingachgook 's of the same opinion . taken together , that 's gospel . your fort will stand or fall depending on webb and reinforcements , not these colonials ' presence .
i judge military matters , captain winthrop , not you .
what 's there to talk about ? she can sing . that puts her at the head of the class . that makes her the only one in the class .
i do n't know ... she had gum on her lip , for christ sake . i do n't think she 's right for the act .
but where will you go ? we 're in the middle of nowhere .
did n't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles ? maybe they have a telephone i might use .
what about this , burns ? kidnapping , eh ?
oh , trying to frame me , eh ! i never saw this woman before in my life !
uh-huh . and it 's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $ ! and if you act now , i might even throw in some free lawn furniture .
no , i ca n't . i 'm sorry ! i have to go ! i have to ...
i think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer .
oh , i do n't want to be in the way . you 've got your career and everything .
i 'm told it 's worth about a million dollars , maybe more .
well , there you go . but what does that tell ya ? a million dollars in jewelry . does that tell you the guy is crazy about you , or what ?
that 's right . you were booed off the stage . that 's got to be -- ?
-- eight years ago . in that whole time , i never left my computer .
listen , captain cold , the suit , maybe , even though silver went out in the 's . but those boots are unforgivable . what is it with men ?
i 'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but i 'm kind of pressed for time . so hand over the diamond , garden gal , or i turn you into mulch .
it 's possible . i just do n't remember .
and you do n't know your name or who you are , that right ?
if the constitution is ratified ... we 'll have a country . they 'll want to elect you president of the convention , which means president of the country .
you know , i came back to mount vernon to retire . i do n't need to be in government .
oh . er ... well you 're the file clerk . you 're hurrying into the next room , when you bump into janet .
but what 's our relationship ? are we good friends , or is she just a casual acquaintance ?
no . if anything , after i looked at it awhile , it got more interesting . it had character , you know ?
what about when you touched it ? what did you expect it to feel like , and then what did it really feel like ?
shut up . the boss ! bruuucce ! ! ! !
sounds funny to me . as much as you say nigger this and nigger that , all your favorite people are `` niggers . ''
he wanted me to kill him , but i did n't . he did it himself .
he says here good-bye . i find it in his room . he is sorry , he says . he has had a wonderful life .
well , you could < u > have < /u > one , but it 'd be a very ineffective war ... we 're < u > done < /u > in days ...
ten days . there going to be any back end in this thing ?
all right . i 've done it . now , are you satisfied ?
fine . and here 's a kiss for you .
what 's your fuckin ' problem ? you get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me .
'uppity ? ' like as in 'uppity nigger ? '
there 's a lot of valuable shit in there , applejack . the silver and the china . the crystal . and the grandfather clock . goddammit , i bet that clock 's worth ten grand .
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car ? it does n't make any goddamn sense .
yeah , i have n't figured out the plot yet , but it 's laid in a siberian village .
you 're a bit eccentric , are n't you ?
parker , tell me what 's going on so i can return as quickly as possible to boston and my whores and cigars , not necessarily in that order .
two weeks ago , we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers .
it 's where situations like these lead , claudia , unless you do something about it early , if and when the police call and come for help . now there are certain measures you can take --
it 's not my boyfriend -- and it 's not anything -- it 's over . really . it 's not . he wo n't came back .
dr. weir , what 's this the door to ?
you 're at the bridge , ms. peters . you still have n't seen any crew ?
the average first offender gets two years for burglary . we were all first offenders . that 's what sophia and peg drew --
two years in the women 's reformatory at framingham .
that time you sent me up last ... i learned book-keeping at sing sing . i figured it might be an in for me somewhere 's .
somewhere 's where they might go out and leave the safe open ?
well , just , you know , have 'em call me . y-you know where to find me , right ?
oh , yeah , drunk on the corner , man . hey , why do n't you buy another beer . it 's on me , okay ?
i 'm jack hardemeyer . i 'm the mayor 's assistant . what can i do for you ?
i 'm an old friend of the mayor 's . i just want to say hello to him .
did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces ?
how could i miss it ? the tv wo n't quit with that stuff .
what is this ? someone else you think escaped us , like frank ?
no , no , this one did n't escape . you told me you 'd always been in hell . you were wrong . look at it . look . it 's you .
that 's how it is with sidewalks . people come , people go , and they all drop shit on the ground . as soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next , the first spot is dirty again .
i just do what you tell me , auggie . you tell me to sweep , so i sweep .
i 'm going after the black pearl . i know where it 's going to be , and i 'm going to take it .
jack , it 's a fool 's errand : you 've heard the tales they tell about the pearl .
but he 'll hear everything we 're saying . and if he just looks out of that window , he 'll see everything we 're doing .
that 's the idea , general schmuck . zlat !
it 's the same thing , is n't it ?
exactly . here . take it to the party instead of me .
thanks for waiting , jackie . now tell me , what can we do for you ?
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job .
it is whispered in the forest that ... ... leondegrance 's castle is under siege by lot and uryens .
yes , yes , i know that . everybody does . lord leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights . i ca n't lose him .
and i know too many people . obviously , we 're both lonely . would you like to know where i was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my sunday clothes ?
i did n't run into you and i bet they 're not your sunday clothes . you 've probably got a lot of clothes .
you mean -- you really want to draw me ?
indeed . i 'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head .
once this was a relationship based on love . now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head .
things change . anyway , you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in maxine .
well , it was my fault -- the break- up . i 'm sorry .
oh , sweetie . it really does cut both ways . we were taking each other for granted and --
al ai n't a-goin ' away , an ' you gon na *tell* him he ai n't a-goin ' away . an ' if you think diff'unt , you got ta whup me first . so some on .
i never *seen* her so sassy . an ' she ai n't so young , neither !
hurray for the bulldog ! half past eleven ! the shows have just let out . people are going to night clubs and restaurants . of course , we 're different . we live in a palace - at the end of the world .
you always said you wanted to live in a palace .
but alfredo , what you 're saying is horrifying !
i know . but take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes , for example ! i think about it a lot ... how is it possible for ...
listen , do n't let it get you down . you 're going to be fine .
me ? i 've never been better . i mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine .
are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind ?
i want you to come to my house . then we 'll talk .
at the time , i do n't know , i thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break .
you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
i just thought we should talk about it . between ourselves .
what 's there to talk about ? she can sing . that puts her at the head of the class . that makes her the only one in the class .
all right ... lem me see ... okay , new burger king opens up . these assholes get excited and start lining up . like it 's some five star restaurant . the place is mobbed . right ?
hmmmm . `` five stars , '' huh ? is that stupid , wesley ?
well ... you 're causin ' trouble , you know that ?
i 'm causing trouble ? ! you 're a pain in the butt ! you newshounds 've been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest . i 'm just sixteen , you know ? who the hell cares what i think ?
you 're not really serious about this , are you ?
all right , do n't join the israelites . perhaps you 're interested in how a man undresses . funny thing about that . quite a study in psychology . no two men do it alike .
yes , he is . he 's very excited and confused , but he 's not crazy , if that 's what you mean .
have you read the papers today ? have you listened to the radio or television ?
and that something 's got to be more than just hunt , liddy , and the five burglars -- those indictments are gon na be bullshit when they come down . what else do we know ?
i just wish we knew when someone would talk to us , that 's all .
not yet . might just as well be . the only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby !
sweeney ? well , after all , he did n't do it on purpose , did he ?
he got a call from dan fawcett a little while ago . his chickens wo n't eat , either .
it 's what you said , mom . mr. brinkmeyer 's feed is no good .
i ca n't believe i did that ... christ . i 'm walking around in a fog ...
no harm done . everything 's okay now . i 've got to be going .
not to worry . there 's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years .
let 's not forget , folks , this is a study on sleep disorders .
ed , this is n't the real world ! you 've surrounded yourself with weirdos !
say it a little louder . i do n't think bela heard you in his trailer .
and jd is his dad , and owns the whole property ?
no mortgage , no debts ; lock , stock , the sodding lot . . . do n't worry , i got it under control .
relax our center ... it 's just sitting in a bucket .
yeah , it 's been a while , but i ... i remember the basic ideas ...
are you mad ? katharine loves it here . she told me yesterday .
all the same , i , were i you i would be concerned -
this is all figured at three cents a copy .
re-figure it , mr. bernstein , at two cents .
yeah , you got it . since you 're the only straight shooter in that fuckin ' office , i 'd like an answer from you . did you plant it ?
dave , do you think we 're out of our minds ? the whole building 's been a zoo since that broke . we ca n't get a thing done . reporters crawling everywhere . you think we want that ?
a myth..just a myth ... should n't you be checking out their countersurveillance ?
well you know his blokes 'll place the oscor in his annex , where else if you 're pinpointing transmitters , video signals , covert chip cameras , anything radiating , oscillating..
well i have n't seen her in months . who knows what 's going on in her head . you 're really running out of excuses to come around , are n't you ?
i know you faith . you 're afraid of something . what 's going on ?
it may sound that way , but i react out of fear . my life has nothing to do with what i like or do n't like . you have n't been listening , have you ?
i did n't know there would be a quiz , george .
maybe it 's crazy , but it 's better than having dunbar dead .
just as you say , hoffy . but would n't it be smarter if i went out and kept schulz tied up ?
i 'm trying to find a style of my own . do you really like them ?
oh yes ... very nice ... very , very nice ...
you 're dying to come into my room , are n't you ?
you want me so bad , why do n't you invite me ?
maybe ... i do n't know , if you want to talk --
naw , it 's ... this guy wants his money .
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident ?
i do believe you . that 's what i want everybody to believe . trouble is , it does n't look like an accident and you 're not here to tell me about it ... i need you to help me here .
i hope you fixed the spare like i asked ya .
yeah , i fixed it . well , i ai n't ... um , i ca n't remember . i think i took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back .
well , let 's say i live in it . such a pleasant place ... all kinds of comfort , easy to reach , close to street car , bus , and subway ...
does that mean that you want me to go there ?
a car wash ! wow , i 've never talked to you when you 've been in a car wash. make sure you 've got the windows closed .
remember that time we were having the car washed and i started playing with the automatic window ? how old was i , daddy ? five or six ? i got absolutely soaked , remember ?
i started thinking maybe it 's about the money so i call you , but all i get is the busy signal . i figure the phone is off the hook , that 's why i come rushing over here .
oh christ , the phone ... that was a fucking stupid thing to do , was n't it ?
i was n't . i heard that jim was in trouble on the radio . he said someone was ...
shut up ! i saw you . you were in the car .
you 're gon na just give me five hundred grand ?
we 'll talk about that , harry . but first i got ta know , how 'd you hook up with chili palmer .
i can talk to these people gordon , they trust me ... and my father can be a big help in getting cuts .
alright ... susan , get buckingham on the box . i want him to look at it . and tell jock taylor at thwick , jensen ... so sport , the falcon has heard the falconer ... tell me more ...
it has to be the cloud . it 's fundamentally altered our dna .
let 's not jump to conclusions , we need a < i > massive amount of evidence < /i > before making that leap .
the owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago .
we 're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- we board it ai n't a animal shelter , y'know ... adrian , i want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs , they 're a mess .
it 's like the voodoo dolls of west africa . the kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him .
thank god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing .
theres a reason i always tell that tony pee-pants story , you know .
trust me . this is bigger than tony pee-pants .
you 'll know presently . at the meeting of the society . but until then , i beg of you fox , keep it to yourself .
certainly , if you insist . you must have quite a find there .
you do n't know me . you do n't know me ! so fuck you . fuck you .
nah-nah-naw ! you done done finally done it ! like a man done it . done it right . i love you , you mean sonofabitch !
luther , i guess you 're all out of excuses .
i ca n't just hack my way inside . there 's no modem access to the mainframe , it 's in a stand-alone . i 'd have to be physically at the terminal .
really nice . should n't that be a good thing ... telling someone , 'no thanks required . '
it looks like it really went over . you 're sure making the rounds . simon says you brought him soup last night . i hope he does n't write you a note .
in her dressing room ? why , what could he be doing there ?
he could be playing solitaire , but i do n't think so .
my name 's edwards ... i 'm looking for my niece ... she was in that camp when you attacked ...
well ... i know there were some captives recovered ...
that was foolish of me . why did n't you shove me away ?
i hated to wake you up . how about some breakfast ?
we 're coming as fast as we can ... we ca n't risk using phasers ...
i understand . tell doctor crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready ...
how someone strong like you scared from a message ? is good news i sure !
the last two messages i got ? the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving ! and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too ... with my wife .
look . i did n't know when we were going to be on until yesterday . what was i supposed to do ? i had the pianos anyway .
basketballs , frank . you had us playing for basketballs .
and i feel real bad about all that but it does n't mean i need to get involved .
you are involved . by being alive you 're involved .
you trust his character more than anyone else does .
raoul is hurrying to the front , so i must hurry too .
cinderella man ! babe , you stuck a tag on that hick that 'll stick to him the rest of his life . can you imagine cobb 's face when he reads this ?
if we could sell tickets , we 'd make a fortune .
think of your health , max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track ...
i do n't know if this would be a wise move ...
yep -- everybody 's having a good time but me -- what do you want , mary ?
i just wrote a poem about the atlantic ocean --
edward , if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal .
i 'll see him alone . everyone knows you 're my muscle . we 'll make it social . tell kross i 'll meet him for dinner . tonight if you can arrange it .
well , harry york is a guy who ... well , he does a lot of things . why do you ask ?
he talked to me today . told me to keep my mouth shut or i 'd get everybody in trouble .
i love being female because it , how do you say , allows me to be close to men .
i 'm glad you 're female . do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene ?
how are you going to pay when you get sick ?
i 'm in a rooming house with mr. green .
i 'm in a motel . has something happened to del ? did he do something stupid ?
betty , i need to talk to you ... in person ! where 're you at ?
do n't tell me , you 're a workaholic .
no . shelly knows what i am . he saw me in a bar with another woman .
... since eight o'clock last night ... ! you 're in love .
do n't be a jerk . there 's no such thing as love at first sight .
but then -- i guess -- something inside me died when i realized that you 'd hired a goon to kill me .
yes . i know . it 's exactly how i felt when i realized you 'd hired the goon to kill ...
nor can i. damn ! it 's buzzing all around me . ouch ! i can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear ... says its name is oona !
oona ? do you suppose it 's a faerie ?
no . i 've seen black men handing out bags of food . having meetings . patrolling the neighborhood . having more meetings . they ai n't ...
they are carrying guns . they are threatening police officers . they are undermining the united states of america . and you inspector brimmer are not taking your duties seriously ...
but a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag .
yeah , but i ai n't talking horse . i 'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that 's a quick ticket to heaven . and the fools keep coming back for more .
yeah , hi . listen , i 've got to talk to your dad . about jason . i 've got a plan . i need to buy some things first but mainly need help to ...
tommy , my father is out looking for you right now . something happened tonight and he 's sure you 're responsible . if he finds you , he 'll ...
mackelway , i could understand . he is over-emotional by nature , but you , agent kulok , you had a shining career in front of you .
just step outside , sir . now . keep your hands where i can see them .
we have at least three months ' work left . we ca n't write a report ... we do n't know enough ... .
we 've got a rare bird here , michael . great whites do n't come to the bahamas . there 's never been one down here before . i 'm not just going to let it swim away .
but our crime was n't burglary . it was balling white girls . they gave us the book .
burglary , count one -- to years ; count two , to years ; count three , to years ...
mrs. mercer , as a former fbi man , it 's difficult to accept this .
i know , but mr. garrison , the fbi is just not doing their job .
we 're all from the sea , mr. hutton . our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans . by continuing to destroy fish , man destroys himself .
the grenade 's just to intimidate whitey . he knows i have it , so he watches out . same is true when i film lions , tigers , rhinos ...
aw , this ca n't be happening to me ... .
they been nose-open for her ever since we left . they go off blood .
no . thank you . it 's really beautiful .
oh it 's nothing . i knew it . i told roberto `` he 's very good that little frenchman , very good '' . i lost my title but i won a watch !
so when you sleepwalk , you go somewhere familiar ?
no . every time i wake up somewhere different . sometimes my bike is laying there next to me . like once when i woke up on the edge of this cliff up on carpathian ridge .
just in case i do n't have a chance to say goodbye , i want you to know that i have n't spent so many pleasant hours for many years .
that 's a very nice compliment , and i 'd like to say that ... you 've done the same for me .
forget it . you ca n't prove it . sister 's testimony is no good . jury knows we win she gets the cash .
i 've got my dr. gruber , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains ...
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed .
my love is no lie . i have a wife , yes , and i can not marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps . it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that . and yet you let me come to your bed .
alright ! hold up . you win . you got the job .
gee thanks . now i do n't have to find that bridge to jump off .
you got ta kid ? how old 's your kid ?
nine . i think . maybe ten . yeah , ten . nice kid .
the last thing i need is you going into my room searching for this while i 'm away .
is that the last thing you need ? my your clever .
nick - i wo n't have you going down there .
say you 're the one who got me in this !
see , now you 've annoyed her . you know she does n't like you to touch me . does she , widdle wee fing ! wuhve you so much ! did you feed her ?
yes , i fed her . if she says she 's hungry , she 's lying to you . again .
... yeah , he ... he lives next door to me .
that 's right , fink , he lives next door to you .
a lot of things i 'd like to forget .
that 's funny -- so was i. guess the ocean makes one sentimental
here we have a typical barrack . it houses seventy-five men . every one of them has his own bunk , naturally .
naturally . it would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk .
if this is a first step in kicking me off the case , just tell me , to my face , sir , do n't waste time being diplomatic .
just , i need results . and -- i am short-handed . who else am i gon na give him ?
you did n't get that break you needed , but you went as far as any man could , bubba . what can i do for you ?
just speculating , i guess . how do you think it started ?
sorry about yesterday ... some big deal came together , no , fell through , and --
's'okay , i had to go home , feed my cat .
i realize you 're under a great deal of stress .. it 's clouded your judgement .
so off the record , he starts talking about my family , and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like i did n't know it or something . he got angrier and angrier and then :
but when john f. kennedy 's elected president , men'1l stop wearing hats .
kennedy 's a catholic . he 'll never win .
look , i told you i 'm not going to college .
well , i think it 's good to keep all your options open . you can always enroll for the winter quarter . you could even live here and go to the city college part time , and still get a job if you wanted to .
you 're touchy , sidney - do n't be so touchy ...
i was n't looking for a brawl . i came to bring him a present . wan na bite to eat ?
oh , it 's fine . fine . good . good . bye . bye .
til thursday , my darling , i shall count the minutes .
this is my city . i 'm a cop . i 'll find em .
alright , johnson , thank you . so ... what are you wearing ?
except for me and billy ... we were left for dead ...
and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head . it 's a perfect ending .
no , no , on the football field . they called me ... ... the smallville flash .
hey , man , that 's a great name for a cocktail !
this is why you do n't show work in progress .
norther , do you ever regret not making it to paris ?
i 'm an airline pilot . ah , clarence , according to my calculations , with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the rockies .
i think you 're the greatest . but my dad says you do n't work hard enough on defense .
mind if we make a stop on the way ? we busted frank antonucci on possession . he gave us a lead on that polk street jewelry heist .
`` phoney frank '' ? do n't waste your time . he 'd tell you his granny was in on the kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar .
eloise does n't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check , kicks .
all right , i 'm not ashamed of it ! i split it two ways 
okay , colonel . but look , there 's a pay phone just outside in the hall . maybe that works , huh ? maybe it 'll work ? what do you think ?
you 've wasted enough of my time , fella .
lis , i want to , i really do , but ... oh , i ca n't .
then do it for peter . mrs. leeman used to call him a `` skinny little fag '' when he 'd bag her groceries . he 'd pop his nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow , i do n't know , got her back .
but you had to have it , did n't you ? it was so nice to listen
i listen to it . every night . when you 're out to the beer parlor .
you think what we 're doing is so wrong ? and what are you doing ? pursuing goodness ? for what ? to answer to some supreme tribunal ?
my only concern is the human tribunal . is n't it yours ?
i do n't , huh ? and what makes you such an authority on what i want or do n't want ?
okay , okay . it 's all so stupid . there 's this guy , see . charles clemm . the creeper , that 's what people call him . the kind of guy you do n't want to cross paths with .
i will not sit by to see the mastery of the british replaced by the mastery of the hindus !
muslim and hindu are the right and left eye of india . no one will be slave , no one master .
this is turning to shit . if word gets out of my involvement in this i 'll go to prison .
listen , we know their names . they do n't know the city . you 'll find them . you 're the fbi .
that dern doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin ' and bein ' mean to folks . will you give me your word you 'll do it ?
well , sure , okay . he has n't hurt them , has he ?
he seems to think they are . he told me that were .
oh no , no , no , no , no . it ca n't be . how embarrassing .
just one more thing . so , mr. m. , uh , do you think tracy 's going to be okay ? i saw her face after the assembly , and i think she 's taking it pretty hard .
do n't worry about tracy . she 'll be fine .
awhile back , dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like , not what you are like ...
yeah , but if you heard this band called the crumblers , you 'd --
the name will live forever . it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia . mhravitch .
when i grow up , i 'm going to go to mhravitch .
you saying whitefolks won . that what you saying ?
those white things have taken all i had or dreamed . i 'm saying ai n't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..they just do n't know when to stop .
then let him go and he 'll follow you .
and let him get run over by somebody else ?
that 's why i wear a fifty dollar hat . was a two hundred dollar hat , i hadda kill you .
bet you say that to all the girls , perfect tommy .
i do n't make jokes about things of , or related to , the preaching of the holy gospel , including the ministerial calling of my family .
so they travel around from place to place and preach ?
talk to him , bruce . there 's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel .
i 'm scared , dick . maybe for the first time in my life . i 'm really scared .
how long were you gon na let me try and stop it ... ?
after a while , it became a little pathetic ... figured i 'd put you out of your misery ...
the usual motivation does n't apply to him , nor the way he uses them . i do n't have an answer for you . listen to me , my friend : leave this .
and do what ? read about the next family in the morning paper ? in my monkey ward safehouse 'cause i ca n't take my family home ? this ends when i make it over .
but you 're in the u.s. army , how could you --
colonel doolittle pulled the strings , and put me on loan to the r.a.f . they need pilots , and we need experience . i leave tomorrow .
i do n't . patrick does n't . and his brother and sister do n't . and they 're in the house with him .
fine . maybe i got nothing to lose . 'cept you .
i ' faith , i am sorry that thou art not well . sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , i warrant , a virtuous , -- where is your mother ?
i have a wonderful disposition , i put people right at ease .
uhh , miss devoto , these people are already at ease . this is not a beauty parlor , it 's a funeral parlor .
it happens to be a matter of life and death .
a man is going to die if he does n't have my fair young body ?
oh , the dauntless is the power in these waters , true enough -- but there 's no ship that can match the interceptor for speed .
that so ? i 've heard of one , supposed to be fast , neigh uncatchable ... the black pearl ?
looks like our goose is cooked , our hash is slung , our fait is accompli ...
lem me guess where you got that from . tell me somethin ' , what 'd you ever see in that guy anyway ?
you did n't say what it was for , did you ?
no , honey . i told him i was buyin ' a car . what is it for ?
you . you 're the guy that lent me the money .
yeah , that 's right . now could you be quiet so i can get some sleep .
how come you get all the good stories , lois ?
it 's because i 'm an intrepid girl reporter , jimmy . besides , the chief of detectives has the hots for me .
well , i 'm coming to it . it seems the professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it ? nobody else but that great thinker , sheriff hartman !
no kidding , hildy . say , this is n't a rib ?
it 's funny , but i kind of sit around , you know , a lot of time to myself ...
i think i 'm getting a malfunction here somewhere .
that 's a good-looking kid you got there , ms. barrett .
thank you , frank . oh , are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom ? i asked you last week .
now , ma -- you just try to set an example for me , and keep hold of yourself .
me ? why , look here , mary stone -- i 'm worried about you , that 's all .
half the men in this prison swear they 're innocent . do n't you think that 's kinda funny ?

what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit ? perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
i do n't know , he did n't say anything .
uh-huh . so how do you know it was a he ?

the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that ?
a lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate . tell him to see me at my office .
well , if he has a claim , we 'd better see him . send him in .
how come ben ca n't turn it on and off like us ?
that 's what we 're here to find out .
< u > i 'm sick of this toy town shit < /u > .
everything you say sounds reason- able . but there 's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite .
these are such horrible pictures . they 're so grainy ... they make me look like ...
do n't think about it . we 'll sort it out . now what would you like -- tea ... bath ... ?
so they tell the kid to throw the world series , or else , huh ?

mr. x , i wo n't make you out a liar .
i do n't know . extra apartment keys . what 's it matter ?
maybe i should check lareaux 's book . it 's in the car . be right back . do n't go anywhere .
sure . it 's unnerving . i remember this one particular married woman , she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash ... i mean , talk about your wind chill factor ...
did n't we have this same conversation in july ? damn it , john , there was an opportunity out here -- i had to take it --
oh , of course ! ! there 's a couple characters you 'd be perfect for : the secretary at the newspaper office , or the file clerk !
hmm . those sound kind of small . oh , here 's one that looks good : janet lawton . i 'd sure like to play her .
i know , but i hung around , 'cause i figured you 'd try an ' pull some shit like this .
now , hold on there . i ai n't pullin ' no shit . it 's my money , i can do whatever the fuck i wan na do with it .
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life , would n't you say ?
as i indicated , admiral , that thought had not occurred to me .
you do n't have to use pig latin ! nobody could possibly know what we 're talking about .
all right . these are the choices : microwave ovens , pocket calculators , walkmans , digital watches and miniature tv 's .
plain-clothes man . come on , slaves , drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death .
listen , flo , cut it out . hard-tack is pretty sore .
i just want to know what the hell he 's doing in his room that 's so interesting he does n't come down for dinner .
maybe he 's building a bomb ... just like- !
< u > nasa < /u > is going to kill the president of the united states with an earthquake .
not exactly the kind of thing a secret service agent can throw himself on top of .
yeah , i guess . maybe not . you do n't think a psychiatrist- ?
the best explanation is always the simplest one . let 's wait . let 's wait and see . in the meantime try not to worry .
we are cloaked . enemy closing on impulse power . range , 5,000 kellicams .
good . this is the turn of luck i have been waiting for .
we were celebrating right after the draft , going from bar to bar . i was drivin ' .
and i put the car into a ditch . he spent eighteen weeks in the ...
yes , you shouted the words `` captain god '' at me for no reason ...
oh , do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you ?
i know - that 's what i said too . anyway , we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank .
well , shit-fire , kansas , that 's the sweetest goddamn thing ever ...
annie , no matter what i do , this horse will never be the same .
... i just do n't know right now ! do whatever you can and when grace is --
since when do you shop at the flea market anyway ?
brad . please do n't tell mom and dad ...
do you still think the joker cares about money ? ?
i do n't know . i 'm just a d.a . i do n't have access to all you expert sources .
yeah , i 've always been able to make my way in the world . i do n't like having to rely on other people .
it 's nice that you can make that choice .
ellie ... the last time we spoke ... i said some things ...
i remember . you were indelicate , indiscreet and entirely less than tactful ... sound like anyone you know ?
then maybe so do we . every night of our lives . he was my brother . my maker . he gave me this life , whatever it is .
i did it for us , louis . so we could be free .
the hell with that ! i 'm not goin ' nowhere ! we 're safe here .
yeah , i 'm not leavin , this fort for nothin ' .
easily said ... the raven passed this way hours ago .
heading true north . we continue in that direction .
you drive away business roarin ' in like that .
yeah , does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin ' on here .
the superintendent met thorwald coming back . he said thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country .
a very convenient guy -- this superintendent . have you checked his bank deposits lately ?
this is my conversation . i 'll say what i fucking please .
wake up . make a right at ocean avenue . the hotel 's a few blocks up on the left .
not editors . take my word for it . not editors !
if they 're going to poke fun at me , i 'm going to
yes . he called some of the biggest people in town .
sure , they 'd turn him down . he ought to know that . i 'm going in there and talk to him .
bullshit ... i do n't walk to talk to you ...
wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
well , i got ta tell you . with a wife , three kids , and a pension plan in the balance , it 's rattling hard .
we say nothing . it goes away . simple as that .
serves me right for asking a direct question . the subject is closed .
well , it looks like you 're a little late .
hang on a sec , you did your little favor for the boys downtown , i 'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here .
i 've seen nobleman swords that were n't as well preserved . it 's just a hunk of peasant iron . why would he be carrying it around in an alley ?
yeah . what 's wrong with you guys ? think ahead . we find 'em , sue 'em . we 'll make a killing . we 'll have dinner at chasen 's twice a week , we 'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives .
sue people like that they 're liable to be having dinner with the judge who 's trying the suit .
it was just a joke . i was pushing the arrow . i wanted to get to the next question . i wanted to find out who was gon na win the series .
are you saying you just made the whole thing up ? the guy never even existed ?
i came all the way here for that ? to walk the lobby ?
yeah . and it might have even worked too .
i could be you rguard ! i could carry your spear !
what a great son you are , ranon . i wish i could take you with me . now go to sleep ...
nothing much . the remnants of a life raft . maybe a small flag . the emblem of my countrymen .
sorry , taylor . the terrain around that lake is poisonous . there is no fresh water , no vegetation . nothing .
-- i know what you mean . i was there , alright . seti 's place . the city of the dead .
what did you find ? what did you see ?
to be strong and free ... that is all i desire .
so you shall be ... like our brothers , the hawk and the wolf , our spirits know no master ... we are created in the pure image of the savage god that set our turbulent universe in motion .
was i wearing something of yours and you got mad at me ?
all my things have me in them . i do n't want you to be like me .
but surely , i mean , perhaps she just happened to live above the buttles , and ...
look after that suit , eh . barbara chose it for me .
you _took_ me , you bastard , and now i 'm taking you .
it 's me or you , ai n't it , pops ?
you 're more than that . i 've had example of the fact that wild horses could n't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you . that 's why i tell you what i do -- about smith and this situation . so , you see --
yeah -- i see i 'm right where i 've been for seven years --
i mean -- a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that .
it all depends on what you 're used to .
rose , i have got doubts about that doctor and so does daddy .
he 's got doubts about hisself and that 's the saddest thing of all . would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him ?
it 's not your decision and he 's not your brother , dignan .
that 's right . i only have one vote . we 'll go talk with anthony and figure it out .
what have you come up with on the riddle ?
`` wee willie winkie runs though the street . '' we think he might be making a reference to himself .
they 've still got to be able to sign his name .
it 's not hard to do . i do it all the time .
take me with you . there 's nothing left for me here .
i can not . you should not worry . van ripper and his wife will look after you . they will . you will be well cared for .
i do not care . you are welcome to use my work area , but i beg you ... return her to her resting place .
in time , doctor . soon as i finish .
she likes to see you off in the morning .
i 'll make sure she does . but first i 'm going make up a nice , big breakfast against that cold outside .
in the morning -- go . i 'll not die until then - i 'll not die  i 'll watch - they shall not hurt you .
shh it 's all right - i 'll be all right .
you will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked .
i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things , but as for my revelations , i 've never told anyone except my king ... charles the seventh ... the one and only king of france .
aaron , i 've never seen them like this -- i think paul 's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to ...
wait . bullshit me a little ... i 'm beginning to appreciate it .
... and you do n't have to put up a dime , roger .
all right , bud ... let 's do it .

i believe you . you had some scary dreams , okay ?
no ! i do n't know - everything 's all mixed up . what difference does it make ? i 'm in trouble here . i need your help .
it 's called `` the philosophy of time travel '' .
what does time travel have to do with philosophy ?
i must have fallen asleep . i was asleep when you got home , was n't i ?
you were asleep when i got home , yes .
forgive me , my friends . i saw terrible things .
they do not exist , except in the waters of the swamp , where they will remain .
really . you 'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no mcp looking over your shoulder .
when you 've been in the system as long as i have , you hear many promises ... many reassurances ... many brave plans ...
de gaulle 's gon na be there . and macmillan . and adenauer . nixon ca n't not be there .
then call him . i 'm sure it was an oversight .
< i > i 've got something , listen now , this one is real good , you 'll see . we 'll send a present to his door upon there 'll be a note to read. < /i >
< i > now in the box , we 'll wait and hide until his curiosity entices him to look inside ... < /i >

the size of this is ... beyond me . testify ?
admiral , i 've got to take the mains off the line . the energizer 's shaken loose and i ca n't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
all right , we 'll do the job with auxiliary power .
i acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the power and light authorities . whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you .
oh yes , power and light . thank you .
who 's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped , or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot ?
how dare you speak to me like that ? i 'm the princess !
oh yeah , ... sorry bout that . so who 's this guy ?
this is prince imhotep , high priest of osiris .
well , bill was always the author , so to speak-

you won ten dollars . big deal . if we do n't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship .
i want to get money for you and the baby .
a couple of moments , i 'll grant you that . a second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity .

< u > forget < /u > the contract . claire . what is it ?
at ease , officers . i 'm peter venkman . i think there 's been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can .

honest to god i 'm broke -- gim me a break .
mr. gazzo says i should get two hundred or break the thumb .
you know damn well about what . you let them take it out of here .
for christ sakes . spare me the speech . i 've listened to it for a decade . the fact is that michael myers was a federal patient , and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law .
if you have something to say , i suggest you say it to morpheus .
i intend to , believe me . someone has to .
i trust ... want to see what i trust ... in god we trust ... the word 's on every bill ! ! !
you keep it up and it wo n't matter how far we get away , because it 's going to be all over between you and me . do you understand that ? there wo n't be anything left .

he 's looking at a few hundred years in leavenworth . he 's not gon na come out without a fight .
it must 've hit the window ... i think its neck is broken .

i ca n't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom .

and other things ... mebbe you thought you was gettin ' away with being comical about that indian wife you took ... i bet she was n't the first squaw you ...
he is dead ! by god 's choice ! there is nothing to discuss .
first they told me he had died at birth . then your father admitted he was alive , but well cared for , in secret . but the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner .
but what i really ca n't believe is that i 'm starting to actually miss work .
have you been in contact with the principal about your job ?
chemco makes many things senator ! we were under government contract !
i have n't been briefed on any such thing !
david , i do n't ... can we talk privately for a second ?

i 'm not supposed to . but i can make an exception .
i 'm kindly surprised to hear you say that .
all the time you spend tryin ' to get back what 's been took from you there 's more goin ' out the door . after a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it .
come one will . i just want to know .
i 'm trying to explain it to you . so you play the piano . when you look at the keys , you see music , you see mozart .
so you may have been duped this whole time . killing innocent people , that must make you feel ... , how does it feel ?
there are other things too . they had everyone start taking those psych tests . did they make you take one ?
oh , my dear boy , i 'm sorry . that 's impossible . why , i have my classes all started .
i do n't care what you 've got started . do you want to go ?
saying what , `` look out for a guy with ten fingers ... ? ''
yeah , that 's too hip for the room .
do you think if you saved catherine , you could make them stop ... ? do you think , if catherine lives , you wo n't wake up in the dark , ever again , to the screaming of the lambs ? do you ... ?
yes ! i do n't know ... ! i do n't know .
do n't sweat it . well . 'night , jeff .
oh , professor tripp ? you know , last semester , what i said that time in office hours -- i hope there 's no hard feelings .
you told a lie and got on a plane .

it 's that bad , huh ? it 's all over my face .
sources have told this reporter that the real reason your park 's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here . comment ?
i would n't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded beanie babies had n't tested % safe .
not now ! not now ! -- let me make up -- let me make up .
suddenly you seem quite desperate , mr. stone -- -- you know i 'm a good-natured man . i 'm always open to reason . with a little security -- i might --
i heard you asking . that guy was n't yanking you around . there 's no such thing .
what other ways are there to get illegal films ? who do you see ?
`` we 're a breed apart and we make no sense '' ... ?
in your particular case , miss , i would make some allowance ...
course i 'll say grace if somebody sets out the food -- -- but my heart ai n't in it . nice drinkin ' liquor .
ought to be . that 's fact'ry liquor . cost me a buck .
the chinese close in five minutes . beef lo mein . it 's been on my mind since i woke . whatjathink ?
i think the moment that food hits your mouth we 'll get a job .
i want you to be aware of what you 're doing and why , because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind .
what would you know about a normal frame of mind ?
huxley 's quote also says , `` his play is always fair and just . ''
so is mine , within the framework of my rules .
you did n't go telling your father you were here ?
are you kidding ? and face a court- martial ?
he said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach .
it 's on an island that no one get to .
look , jake . she gave us mulwray 's real phone number and address .
all she needed for that was the phone book !
not for long , boy . i 've outstayed my welcome already .
it 's funny you would mention rose , i was thinking about her all the way up in the car . or maybe it is n't so funny .
no , no . it 's not ... are you still on the pill ?
yes , of course . there 's nothing to worry about .
`` nocturnal . external hair and bony plates . locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers . reduced optic chiasm '' ... poor eyesight . `` external mucoid nasal glands , '' ... very keen scent ... `` morphological characteristics : highly robust . aggressiveness : extreme . ''
so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night .
you think the killer and the desecrator are the same ?
maybe somebody crazy , someone with a spite against the church , some unconscious rebellion , perhaps .
you 'll have to find that out , wo n't you .
the slush fund at creep financed the ratfucking , we 've almost got that nailed down , so --
you do n't believe in anything do you , bobby ?
i believe in this moment , that 's all . there is nothing else . come on . he must weigh pounds .
no , of course not . and since the show runs hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement .
yes , everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors ' wardrobe , food products , to the very homes they live in --
i know what a hologram is , captain . the question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village ?
data , if you were following the boy and discovered this ship ...
we ca n't go on this way . i just ca n't go on living with you . not this way .
no . we ca n't ca n't go on this way . we ca n't go back to the old way either .
of course . alfred still keeps your mother 's picture in his room .
anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who joanna clark is ?
what will you do if this works , if we get the money ?
i do n't know ... maybe i 'll live on a boat , sail to all the places i 've never been .
do n't you < u > realize < /u > --
thirty-five to the left -- sixty- three , eight ... i would n't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... seventy-six , eighty-four , fifty-five -- what has she got that i have n't got ?
yes , yes , but there 's no need to bring that up . how far are you prepared to help me ?
just say the word , sir , and i 'll do anything .
hell , jack , your leisure activities ai n't my business .
do n't fuck with me , bill . your post here as chief is in dire straits you do n't work this shit out .
uncle louis . he 's a year old amazing guy , is n't he ?
i 'm very pleased to meet you , uncle louis .
are you sure there 's nothing else i can bring you ?
i 'll have one more coke ... do you want another coke , stacy ?
so many tubes to get in , only one is the way out .
great.. great . is there any kind of hint or anything ?
and nothing . he 's just feeling us out .
he 's trying to get a foot hold in our territory .
you can hardly get your arms around me . how depressing . you 're so early .
i had to excuse myself from a meeting . it 's ridiculous . i kept thinking about the baby ... you ... and , i swear , i was going to start bawling right into my briefs .
shut up , you dummy . who did this to you ?
these two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits . i think armani . they were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit ... i did what you would have done .
that 's a shame , bobby . a real shame .
and that 's not the half of it , mr. arkadin ...
i tell you -- he did n't do it .
they 'll want more than your word for that .
sorry i 'm late , i got lost dropping ben off at kevin 's .
it 's okay , it 's twenty minutes . the horse 'll be there .
right after you change your wardrobe , your personality and drop about thirty pounds .
quite a mouth on a girl so young ... ... but my guess is talking is not what it does best .
me too . but i 'm not sure uncle charles will be .
you let me worry about him , okay ? personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers , rennie . you made the right decision .
it may well be . i know how you won that election selena . you ca n't fool me .
i have plans nigel . you could come with me ... i 'm going places .
tell me brian , what would happen if the client lost the key ?
then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
the two bullets went in here , through the top of the skull , criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs . this one clue tells us three distinct facts . number one ... duffy .
they shot him at a downward angle . they put him on his knees .
you spent a day in superior . i wasted my entire life there . i feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders .
we 've still got some dead weight to get rid of .
ai n't seen you in months , boy . thought maybe you took a fall .
naw , just a little hard times , that 's all . it 's all over now .
of the separate chemicals -- i do n't know , uh , offhand --
how much of this shit do they have , white ! !
that never changes . you know , when you and grandma are gone , the family 's gone . i never see the cousins anymore .
it 's your grandma 's strudel that 's kept this family together .
i do n't know what you 're talking about !
bullshit ! you 're just as much a part of it as they are !
there be no finer victuals than worm flesh , lad .
better we eat him than the other way round .
oh , kitty , i do n't know . this is so last-minute ... eddie is in new york ...
rose ... i do n't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters . this has been a dream of ours for a long time . sometimes i doubt your commitment to sparkle motion .
voodoo stick ? it 's nothing like that will . you 're just being cynical .
i 'm being realistic . look , i have a spiritual side . i mean , we had a priest come in and bless the house . that should count for something .
and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast , and determine what 's to be done with him .
at the very least , this man has the right to know whether there 's a charge against him .
i need to know where tyler is . ca n't you help me ?
sir , you 're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior .
yeah , they 're good . they 're good , tommy .
what is it with you ? ca n't you talk ? you got like a funny attitude . i ca n't figure you out , joey . what 's with you and the quick answers ? you wan na get outa here fast ?
hi . this is nikki . leaves a message .
i just got out of a six-year relationship . okay ? that should help to explain why i 'm acting so weird . it 's not you . it 's me . i just wanted to say that . sorry . this is mike .
yes , of course  but the police would say you 'd probably had a bad dream .
he was a kind little man in his way  and i made him go down that hall into the darkness . i made him do it .
his personal effects . he 's probably running away -- the coward .
sometimes it 's worse to stay than it is to run .
and then the cabin banged and the left side exploded . the the whole plane ... blew up . it was so real . exactly how everything goes .
been on many planes that blew up , have you ?
sure . all right . we 'll have breakfast . i get up about one o'clock . tomorrow .
well tomorrow noon there 's a ... i got a ...
you have to forgive me , but in these circumstances ... with your daughter ... were there any indications of ... any sort of abuse ?
there was n't anything like that . the police and the fbi people asked , but there was n't anything happened like that , never . my husband ... his heart broke when mary left ...
you know harry lied about how that boy hocker got kilt . and it was harry who saw emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog .
i remember harry always trying to help someone . he got lulla 's daughter out of trouble . he was always running to the store for someone who could n't leave the house .
why do n't you take me with you ? ... i 'm ready , now . you said i learn very quickly .
quick does n't mean `` ready '' . and you ca n't discuss , we said . right ?
i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
performance number one thousand of this one - if i play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch ...
who thinks about such nonsense ? now i 'm alive . when i 'm dead , i 'll be dead .
i do n't understand . are n't you frightened ?
you did too . sybok could n't possibly be your brother because i happen to know for a fact that you do n't have a brother .
technically , you are correct . i do not have a brother .
bree -- honey - please , we 're waiting for someone .
arlyn , he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about .
what do we have on this `` insectopia '' ?
scattered reports , sir . rumors . nothing reliable .
i 'll bargain with you . how many of you are on the island ?
two of us ... only two of us ... me ... and him .
quiet . tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about art mooney ...
i found a lot of art mooneys . none with a police record , though . not even synchronicity . have you checked out johnny pinzolo/crunch 's houseboat yet ?
when did harp say they 'd have the warrant ?
he 's pushing it through first thing . you better get some sleep tonight , it could be an interesting morning .
you better hurry . the police will be here any second . i do n't really understand my motivation with this . why am i washing glasses ?
now you 're an accomplice in a homicide . everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg .
y-yeah . gee , doggone it , i never thought about that . gosh !
and another thing , what about all the kids in the country , the kids that idolize ball players ? what are they gon na think about you ? close shot : of the colonel . he has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina .
wo n't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon . looks good though . they found the receipt in his townhouse . it was pretty smeared but had taupin 's father listed as a signatory .
round up who you can and put them on standby .
rosomoff , i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents .
perhaps . but every now and then someone pays attention . you did .
there 's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air . it wo n't kill you , but it will hurt .
you have issues . i mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out .
if this kid was some unknown soda jerker , they would n't have pinched him . but he 's george winton and they 're playing him up . it 's a roman holiday for every paper hat editor in new york .
why the goose pimples ? if he was n't social register -- if it was somebody like me , you 'd be trying to hang him .
boy , would i like to borrow a cup of that sugar .
look - no butter , no pastry , and no sugar !
no , ed -- what with me running for my life , i did n't have time to check those things --
i was just asking . are you all right ?
oh , jimmy , ca n't you forget about your career for one second ?
-- planet . i mean , you were there . do you think it was natural , or like some people are claiming , supernatural ?
we 'll be at the fallbrooks . the number 's next to the phone .
i know , and next to that is the police , hospital , fire , and probably national guard .
he used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way . when he was watching from the woods . why did n't he use it to go through the basement door ?
because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed .
so could i. and i 'm a poor businessman .
i have a proposition for whoever has those letters . i will handle the entire transaction , get rid of the letters , take all the risk , for a small percentage .
oh , yah , but there 's not a heckuva lot to discuss . what about you , mike ? are you married - you have kids ?
well , yah , i was married . i was married to - you mind if i sit over here ?
aunt lily is the one who married your father 's cousin ?
no , that 's aunt connie . lily is the one who looks like a hooker .
there 's still a big spot on the floor .
okay , we need wallpaper paste . hey cece !
mary clarence , i have given you every opportunity . to change . to make a decent life for yourself .
a decent life ? excuse me ? as what ? a janitor ?
oh ... that 's strange . maybe -- are you sure this is your bag ?
of course it is ! are you doubting me ?
yah , well , it 's a chunk , but -
i thought you were gon na show it to stan grossman . he passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me .
this will get me a second term . damn it , without risk , there 's no heroism . there 's no history . i , nixon , was born to do this .
mr. president , this can not be breathed ! especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin rogers ... the chinese would never trust us again . the only way , i emphasize only way , to pull this off is in secret .
my orders came through . my squadron ships out tomorrow . i 'll be leading a very important mission .
oh , ted , please be careful . i worry about you so much .
lauren called me that when we were little . daisy . no one knew but us .
honey . it 's does n't mean anything . it 's not a message .
let 's go see pierce patchett . run a good-cop-bad-cop .
which one are you and which one am i ?
my god . murdered ? -- what 's this have to do with rorschach ?
it 's -- he 's got some kind of conspiracy theory . he thinks someone 's . . . i do n't know , stalking us .
of course we 're ready . we 've taken all the classes . the nursery . the books --
i know we 're prepared . i just do n't know if ... i 'm ready .
you should know that it 's not wise to play halloween pranks on me .
you 're the only man for the job , sam . things have n't been the same since you left . i 'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country . old colleagues . this is your change to finally make a difference .
yeah . those . that always put the fear of god in me . what about you ?
well , to be honest , the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin ' to get to me .
who the fuck breaks in through the neighbor 's house ? !
we 've got the kid ! we 've got your kid ! ! what the fuck is she thinking ? !
how ; we do n't know where they are ?
we 'll have to make them come to us , wo n't we ? and since there are two of them , we 're going to set two plans in motion . first : we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night .
charenton has changed ; it 's not safe for you here .
i 've you to look after me , have n't i ?
he 's addressed this letter directly to you , has he ?
yes , sir , he has . the usual -- india 's salt belongs to india -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the dharasana salt works .
fine , no , not really , they arrested my cousin , but jurek says they 'll let him out . this is disgraceful .
do n't worry , it wo n't last long .
so what i want to do is stop it here . i 'm going to make him an offer . i want to do it myself . i want it to come from me .
all right . but let 's keep the price down . i 've called ed concannon . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we 're going to trial .
< u > do < /u > you . what does that mean ?
it is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native florence .
oh my god . she 's become my pimp . and she 's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder .
no . it 's not like that . you 're being completely neurotic . i was just playing along ...
i always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who 's twenny years younger than he is so that when he 's forty , his wife is a real nice-looking doll .
that means he 'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old .
how you doin ' plissken ? you like the watch ?
you assholes did n't bring me here to give me this for years of dedicated service . what'ya want ?

whoever 's doing the herding is gon na have their hands pretty full . i think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it 's inside , and to serve as ... as ...
but ... they 're odd-looking . they 're for milk . your mum 's got them . you must have seen a thousand of them -- what 's the fuss about ?
actually , i ca n't think really -- let me just have a quick look ...

there you go ... must you always spoil everything !
what kind of war is this mac ? up there in cumberland , we never see an air-raid . the worst problem i have is getting a new typewriter ribbon . when i rode in against the turks , i knew what it was about .
did you ? you thought you did . we 've been gypsed , all our lives . look at your street .

you want to go out there -- get out of this for a second ?
why do n't you lead ? i 'll just follow the flurry you cause .
there 's nothing to be scared of , baby . it 's just another storm . try to get some sleep .
i ca n't . the voice man is coming to get me .
how long will it take to receive them all ?
i 'm not certain , mister president . the boys in concom do the pencil work .
i 'll have no more to do with it . i 'll not put my neck into the noose , not even for your sake , dr. macfarlane .

the weird thing is i 've had an odd , morbid fascination with wolves ever since .
but we know who killed maureen prescott , billy loomis and stu macher . i mean , they even told sidney how they did it !
yeah , but , if i 'm not mistaken , you said in your book that sidney got it wrong before . she accused cotton weary of murdering her mother , and he was sent away for it ! maybe there is a third killer . sidney might know something
is that the man who called you up here ?
yeah , that 's dr. st. luc . he 's the head of our little medical clinic here .
it 's really `` f. lee montgomery '' -- but that gets whittled down to just `` flea . '' for short , ma'am .

yes . what do you mean ? what 's wrong ?
did the alarm go off ? the house ... they ... you did n't see ... ?
i doubt it . how did you find out ?
he called me up . he wanted to talk to me about my ideas .
some kind of breeding pens ... i suppose ... they say people used to breed animals , fish , anything ... ... to eat , of course .
ycch . to kill things and then eat them . it must have been a savage world .
everett , i never figured you for a paterfamilias .

i always forget to put the sign on , but we do have vacancy . twelve in fact . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies .
in the past two days i 've been to so many motels , my eyes are bleary with neon . this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large .
no no , the wealth was all mother 's .
but your father -- he runs stuff , he --
it was so cool . he did n't say a word . he was just ... ready , you know ? and we did n't kiss or talk or anything . he just sat there and let me do all the work .
you dog ! i did n't see you go back there .
well , roy , if that 's the way you feel , i wo n't badger you . do n't want to lose you as a salesman , too .

... and bill mayhew almost caught him in his net ... ?
doctor , you 're the one who told me what it was !
for her , they might make an exception . if not , i 'm afraid she 'll become a poisoned dragon .
it 's not our affair . even if wudan accepts her , her husband might object .
it was n't tom that broke in the room .
it has to be tom . you said he ripped up his own pictures , he --
tim , can we go ? this is ridiculous .

no , i 'm the one who 's sorry . i misjudged you . now if you 'll excuse me , i have some oozing to do .
what about ... those guys ... i might have ...
no way can anything be proved . all they have are some wolf hairs . no one believes in werewolves .
peter . i do n't see you rushing home to trim the tree .
that 's because i 'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money .
what 's wrong with that ? the fbi was very understanding when i explained it to him . everybody knows it is n't you ... it 's the pressures from your home life .
for god 's sake do n't start in on heidi again ...
yeah invitations , you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it .
well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the queen on it . will that do ?

what do you think this plan is , edgar ? a nuclear attack ?
he 's lying , clyde . always has . that 's why nixon 's always been useful . hold still . and take your hand off your hip .

denver control , this is flight two-zero- niner intersecting victor airway seven- niner-niner .

mr. kelson , here 's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism .
what about that psychic , what 's his name , szabo ?
troy 's still my son no matter how you feel about me .
for once in your life think about what 's best for troy . who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up ? who ?
they castrated him . he ca n't shoot arrows , he ca n't piss smoke .
i ca n't screw . i ca n't screw .

i 'm afraid i 'm a little confused . you see , i assumed you were coming here for
all i want is thirty-nine sixty . if you 'll give me a check i 'll get out of this place . it gives me the jitters .

nobody is illegal in my cafe ! they 've got green cards , they 've got relatives who were born here -- if they only had a little common sense i 'd be very happy .
if you spent a little more time training them --
i hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this , madame de beauharnais . i called to bring this to your son , but i understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon .
yes , i 'm afraid he is . i believe he is riding . i know he 'll be heartbroken to have missed you .
that , and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks .
well , you know me . the more they 've got , the less they 're worth . this guy must be the most worthless man in america .
the ball is in richter 's court . but we 're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people -- we 're gon na stop the son-of- a-bitch !

you think that matters ? you think they give a shit about anything ? the little bastards .

yes , yes , but there 's no need to bring that up . how far are you prepared to help me ?
it does n't look much like the fish spears i knew back in marblehead..
our friend , poseidon , did n't use it for fishing . he raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves .
fuck it 's over . that money 's mine .
that money 's fucked up your brain . talley 's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up , and we 'll all be fuckin ' killed !

you could have told me any time you were jacqueline 's husband .
things changed , mary . the reasons for finding jacqueline changed . i want to find jacqueline to settle things .
it 's very simple . she belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of park avenue , expensive restaurants , and literary cocktail parties .
people with sense can belong wherever they 're put .

it was over with bill before you ever came home . maybe you do n't remember it now , but you were pretty hot to see me back then .

thanks . i like it when you say that , sam .
it 's still there , jake . even if you never say a word about it . you ca n't spend two years in vietnam ...
what does that have to do with anything ? does it explain the barricaded subway stations ? does it explain those godforsaken creatures ?

what else can i think after a tale like that ? good heavens , bob , things like that do n't happen today . we 're living in the twentieth century .
so you think it 's all nonsense , huh ?
i 'm sure he 's wonderful company and all , but ... does n't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale ?
somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome , i 'd suppose .
listen to me ! just listen , okay ? there 's a man , vincent , he 's coming to kill you !
he 's ... what ? say again ? we 're in cell hell ...
jim , come on , honey , get down on your hands and knees and hunt for jasper 's easter egg .
you know i do n't like these tribal rituals , freckle face . i 'm interviewing clay shaw this morning .
i got it in the inaugural . `` thank you for voting for me , but , < u > as < /u > importantly : thank you for < u > voting < /u > ...
getting off on the inaugural ? gon na go ...
your bellmoth case . the fbi thinks there might be mob ties .
i 'm a labor lawyer . there are < u > always < /u > mob ties .
all the more reason to watch him . he 's had some wild notions lately .
do n't bother . go to bed and get some sleep . i 'll be working late . i can hear any movement down here .
give it to the bail bondsman , max cherry . he 'll take care of it .
max cherry ? you and him friends now ? you tell him about this shit ?
i dunno what to say to you sweetheart , it is what it is .
bullshit it is . i said , about as loud as i could say it , `` no jail time for my guys . ''
no , but it might as well be the same thing . this was a message ... from someone , or something ... hinting ... at the design .
alex , on the plane ... you must have experienced ... some kind of hyper awareness . but here ... you 're suggesting tod 's death ... and maybe our own ... will happen because of ... an active presence .
i know who you are . kinda out of your neighborhood , are n't you ?
yeah , i had to go slummin ' . see , a friend of mine 's bein ' framed .
hey , whatta ya doin ' here -- we 're closed ... yo , we 're closed !
are ya closed to the general public or to just everybody .
now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there was n't any reason , they were so far ahead . but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in .
so maybe watergate was n't really about watergate -- maybe that was just a piece --
because my son is ... my son seems to be fond of you . and i ... i 'm not quite sure how i feel about it . i really do n't know if i ... like you or not .
is that so important , mrs. brenner ? you liking me ?
qualen , go fuck yourself . the game 's over -- you lost .
no , the goddamn game 's not over ! it 's never over when you 're playing against a team that does n't care if they win or lose -- how do you negotiate with someone like that ? !
it wo n't hold , ronnie , it wo n't prove out .
we do n't need it to prove out . we need it to < u > distract < /u > them for two weeks til the election .
relax , it 's a street job , easy except for the smell . we 'll just throw him in back and zip over to mercy -- no blood , no dying , that 's how i look at it . he 's just a drunk .
it 's not our job to taxi drunks around .
not chopped up . not chopped up like that . i mean , what do i got left ? coupla articles . a medal or two . plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore .
i think you 're getting a little moody there , eddie .
that 's a cartridge , if i 'm not mistaken . gunpowder , bullet , cartridge case , and fulminate of mercury percussion cap -- all set to go . paul i was cleaning it .
pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber -- where it belongs .
you 're not a doctor , you 'll hurt him !
what else should i do , damn it , he 's dying !
you ai n't my dad ! you wo n't never be my dad !
-- and when we come back , we 'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together , john !
captain spock , if you do not hear from us within < u > one hour < /u > your orders are to restore what power you can , take the enterprise to the nearest star base and alert starfleet command when you are out of jamming range .
sir -- we wo n't leave you behind ... !
first of all , i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the `` enquirer . ''
that 's just a little promotion scheme . nobody expects you - mike , will you try and get mr. leland some coffee ?
tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request .
he said you say that ! he also said if that be the case , you 'll be dining with the crew , and you 'll be naked .
i do n't mean to hurt you . i know this is a terrible thing . and i have really loved you .
whoa . whoa . have really loved me ? letty , it 's natural to be nervous . but we 're going to work through our problems .
cut it out , ma , or i 'll --
you 'll *what* ? ... come on , pa. come on an ' whup me . jus ' try it .
yes . i 'd never been in a place like that before .
i have , lots of times . my mother used to clean them . i used to piss in their pools .
yeah , she must do all the flying around when i 'm asleep . harry dunne .
no thanks , not hungry . harry dunne . why does that name not sound familiar ?
hey -- she 's in a tough situation . i cut her some slack --
but i 'm the one in charge of her sorry ass .
hey , pete . ca n't believe your tank 's dry up at the mill .
no ... hell , no . just got in the truck , started drivin ' , looked down at the gauge and saw a big `` e '' starin ' at me .
would that impress you ? is that what it takes to impress the empress ?
your mind is just twisted enough . i believe you 'd do all this just to get a dip or two .
i have n't got a book down my trousers .
right -- well , then we have something of an impasse . i tell you what -- i 'll call the police -- and , what can i say ? -- if i 'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario , i really apologize .
executive privilege will make it look like we 're covering up .
we are covering up ! for some petty , stupid shit . there are things i can say -- when other people say them , they 'd be lies . but when i say them nobody believes me anyway ...
oh , yeah , well , you know . i 'm a big fan . i 've read all your work .
yeah , right . even i can barely read all my work .
hm . you think we should ask them for their landscaper ?
hm . do you like fucking out of doors ?
poor bastard never knew what hit him . jesus , i almost felt sorry for the guy .
i got ta work off some of this adrenaline . i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn . anybody want in ?
and you struck him right here in our house ?
yes , i 'm sorry , i struck him right here in your house . and i 'll strike anybody in anybody 's house that calls me a cinderella man .
she 's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers , mr. thompson .
i 'm not from a newspaper exactly , i -
he 's so modest . probably embarrassed by all the attention .
well , that 's too bad , this is his day .
i made the cut the line gesture . you nodded okay . '
i thought it was the `` we 're dead '' gesture ! i was agreeing ! like i know where the hold button is ? ? ?
you thought that up all by yourself , huh ?
why , it 'll make all the front pages . a spectacular thing like that
... she fixes him pork chops and rice , the next thing you know they 're making love on the sofa . she says he was very gentle .
i spoke to her . the guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him .
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh .
it was him , tatum . i know it .
whoa , jim . maybe . but we ca n't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe .
all right . how about this ? we put a watch on this pemberton , somebody tries to grab him ...
that 's a-no good . if i apologize we no got a war . look -- i send you a scrap of paper . you send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap .
you 've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- now , who can i insult ? ... who do we owe money to ? ... ambassador trentino ! how about him ?
then something goes wrong . meeks gets killed . maybe stens got greedy , killed meeks and left him under his girlfriend 's house . the night he died , stens was all mysterious . said he had something big going down .
the nite owl ! stensland was going there to sell the heroin .
and what makes you think he 's in this territory ?
yesterday , one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago ... he talks crazy but i brought him along ... says he lives here ... keeps mentioning a rocking chair .
we ca n't just sit here waiting to die .
you come up with a better plan , let me know .
mom , ca n't you tell him that i 'm sick ?
you are sick , that 's why he 's here .
but we need to start off with a bang ! something we < u > know < /u > the audience will want to see . mmm . what was your biggest hit ?
hmm ... my biggest hit ? that would probably be `` dracula . ''
i 'm sorry , baby , i 'm just not grocking your head space .
oh forget it . as a fellow player on the international stage , mr. powers , i 'm sure you 'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act .
well sir , he 's quite seriously deformed , and i fear the other patients would find him ... rather shocking .
deformed ? is that it . then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable ?
you have books ? ! kalen , you 've got to take me there . there might be history . records . something to help us find where the morlocks took --
i should n't have mentioned it . we ca n't go there .
do n't fake me out , clark . or whoever you are .
whoever , i look , maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head . i'ii meet you back at the motel .
i 'm not here to run errands . i 'm here for the mask .
if i ca n't trust you to pick up a painting , how can i trust you about the mask ?
how many men does cornwallis have under his command ?
four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry ... ... including the green dragoons under tarleton .
well , i am the head of this household --
i want him to at least see the sky !
we do n't hang them at home , y'know  just in the streets..
i see.. and ... how do you respond to being called  hmmm ...  yes , `` the pickaninny of the art world . ''
that-that wont do . thats not the way it goes . you saw it , you tell it , thats the way ...
im finished here and im tired , emily . you shouldnt be here . now dont make it worse .
with tinsel and plastic icicles and ... on his penis , sir .
i get the idea . you got a description ?
i do n't like those studs they 've sent . i want you to have pearls . nice big pearls .
now , i 'm not going to wear ear- rings , i can tell you that .
i ca n't be absolutely sure -- ? ? we 'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark , it was certainly dark when i walked him down to his car .
so signor miles drove away and you did what ?
it is n't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady . now he 's got them to cancel the fair .
and the fireworks . hand me that box , marty .
the motorcycle gang ? do n't they deal drugs and rape young girls ?
i 've never had any problem with them . people say it 's the safest block in the east village . i just hope their motorcycles do n't keep you up at night .
but knowin ' me and you gon na be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook . i love airports now . me 'n ' you can get on any one of those planes out there , and go anywhere we ant .
you ai n't kiddin ' , we got lives to start over , we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch .
do n't you put the past in a room , in the cellar , and lock the door and just never go in there ? because that 's what i do .
probably . in my case it 's probably a whole building .
this is not bad news , tatsi . perhaps they fled or could not make it home . there is hope .
please go back , bring the children to us .
someplace where nobody knows him so they ca n't connect him with us .
well , webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system . how about ... hmmmm , someplace small ...
no , i intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause i do n't like you .
is mom here ? i got ta talk to her .
it has . but you 'd be surprised . they understand -- they really do . it 's not the workers you have to worry about .
good . ba will have to teach you to spin too .
the chef cooked for you special ; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good ! draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house .
is my credit good enough to buy you out ?
i think i 'm on to something . you and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called yoyodyne .
yoyodyne propulsion systems ? you think they 're mixed up in this ?
i agree , majesty , but i 'm afraid it 's not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop .
very small pay , i imagine . i 'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer . say , an opera in german for our national theatre .
jimmy did n't kill leo . why do you wan na do this ?
he tried to kill him twice before . that 's a good place to start do n't ya think ? leo was on the other side , was n't he ?
really ? you think this is its way of saying `` hi there '' to the people of the earth ?
there are millions of other species on earth , doctor . only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man .
how would < u > you < /u > know , what --
and even if they < u > did < /u > , i doubt < u > he < /u > or < u > she < /u > would have problems with < u > tents < /u > .
how can you call it a good thing ? a graveyard for pets killed in the road ! built and maintained by broken- hearted children !
well , but missus creed ! it ai n't quite that way , deah !
the man 's the same , even if the name is n't .
no -- he 's not the same . alexander dyle was interested in clearing up his brother 's death . adam canfield is a crook . and with all the advantages you 've got -- brains , charm , education , a handsome face --
it does n't have to be true . it just has to be good .
take over the register while i 'm gone , okay , jimmy ?
kid 's getting out . i got him a pardon .
yeah , but what about me and ray ? i did n't see our names on that pardon . you said you were gon na put in a good word for us .
from other nuns ... yes i ... i 've noticed .
from other people ! i believe she is not crazy , nor is she lying .
just remember : they think there 's ten billion dollars in gold down there .
thank you . `` now hear this : drop dead . ''
you see what i mean , do n't you , pop ?
this town is no place for any man unless he 's willing to crawl to potter . you 've got talent , son . you get yourself an education . then get out of here .
i do n't mind him , but who the hell are you ... my valet or something ?
valet ? you jest of course . i am a u.s. marshal .
oh , yes - you - you wanted to go home , huh ?
oh , no , i wanted to go along with you .
elaine , when are you going to realize simon kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way .
and when are you going to realize , ted , that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now .
all right , john , just take a breath , let 's think about this ...
i 'm out of breath ! i 'm a fucking fugitive !
no , i did n't . i said , `` will it change my life , '' alvy .
you said , `` will it change ... '' wife . will it change ...
we 're not coming in there by force , okay ? no one wants to hurt you .
i got these people ! you try to come get me , i 'll kill every fuckin ' one of them !
you promised to come for tea yesterday . i waited for so long .
i 'm sorry . i have n't even got any cigarettes left !
adopted . i should have know . of course . if it was a snake , it 'd bit me !
what ? i do n't understand you . i do n't understand anything anymore .
he was a present . besides , we 're moving anyway . you said .
we 'll discuss this later . obviously . you left the door open .
good morning ... if you show me where things are , i 'll make us some coffee ...
no ! do n't go back into the house ... it 's too nice outside .
you 're coming back to work for us , right ?
i wan na . but i got ta show this asshole i got an honest-to-goodness job before he 'll let me move out on my own . i ca n't work for you guys and be worried about gettin ' back before ten o'clock curfew .
you humiliated the woman ! sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score .
best case scenario , you 're back on the payroll for awhile .
he looks me in the eye like some fuckin ' gold fish , and says : `` i 'm going to beat you '' .
... that 's what he 's here for , is n't he ?
no cursing in this house , young man . use the strong vocabulary god gave you .
i do n't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town !
look , you tell me to take pictures , i take pictures .
let me explain something to you , walsh . this business requires a certain finesse .
you mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator ?
you treat folks special when they company . it 's just supper , r.l. , shit .
sheriff , i ca n't afford not to fish toni ...
look , no way i 'm lettin ' you out there . in a half hour you could be in canada .
havent you ? then why the worried messages on his answering machine , rhian ? id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble .
you-youre wrong . i just called to ask if i could stay with him next time im in london . thats all .
love ? come on , i would n't call it love .
oh no ? i ai n't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the blue monster .
very good , chief . chief guard turns to alex .
forward to the white line , toes behind it . full name and number to the governor . chief guard closes door .
oh , yeah . i did n't know my dad . well , i knew him , till i was six . he went and married another woman , had more kids . every six years or so he 'd do it again -- new city , new family .
he was setting up franchises . my father never went to college , so it was really important that i go .
we just ca n't do it anymore . this is our chance to get away .
i 'm going to see you get that chance .
i 'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends .
now i think i have upset you . my english perhaps is coarse .
pops a couple more potatoes on pauline 's plate . herbert glances at pauline .
thought i 'd have a go at building the birdhouse on saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand ?
to what ... learn how to shoot ? they do n't get a gun .
they make $ a week to start . they fold the flag , check the place out in the morning . i do n't know what they learn , sonny .
you do not want me to do your cover .
i do n't want you to do the cover , i , i need you to do the cover .
and you keep the records , or contribute to 'em .
shorthard the radio transmis- sions , write 'em up , file 'em in a cabinet . nobody ever looks . just take up space .
... i 've got a right to say something . i mean , you 're tying my hands here ! they say you 're not ready to know .
i 'm not ... now , where are those shoes ...
come on . we got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep .
i 'll eat when i 'm good and ready .
he 's former army and the best i 've ever seen in a room . besides , he knows the territory , we did basic together here . you 've had three hours with dunbar and have n't gotten a peep , we need to take a different tack .
he 's not army , it 's not official --
oh , well , i 'm goin ' uptown , too .
uh , well , you just said you were going downtown .
alert all commands . calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them . do n't fail me again , admiral , i 've had quite enough !
yes , my lord . we 'll find them .
i told you it 's impossible for me to have a baby .
you will have this baby . if you want it . if you do n't , i can stop it now .
i was walking down the street ... i remember , i was writing a ...
what glasses were you wearing ? were you wearing your reading glasses ... ?
yes ? oh , hello -- sure i got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents .
okay , okay . look , sylvia -- instead of friday - could we make it thursday night ?
what happened to you , nick ? i mean , look at yourself ...
i know , look at me , well ... what happened ? i do n't know . i do n't even really know . i have some things to try to take care of ... i need the car a little while .
the precogs are pattern recognition filters , nothing more .
but you call this room the `` temple '' .
yes , of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
-- you could have the stamps . i 'll get you some here , okay ?
we 're only joking ... ..it is your round though !
well , this place is too expensive so you 've had it .
i know what you 're saying . and i 'm telling you i do n't trust him --
i know you do n't trust him . you do n't trust anybody --
marie , just -- -- just stay there ! -- just --
-- he 's got my picture ! -- this is yesterday ! -- this is me ! -- -- where did you get my picture ? --
i ca n't discuss another patient . you know that . well , i ca n't find anything wrong with you .
i 'm sure it 's not for a lack of looking . maybe i should get a real complete physical . you give alan an annual , do n't you ?
she married an old man , she 's made a living on telling women they 're too fat , she hawks her crap on the home shopping network ...
a ) he 's an old man with a really big penis . b ) she never told me i was fat . and c ) victoria principal sells on that network .
and the surprise is there 's nothing in it .
i know , but if we ca n't put in all these wonderful things at least let 's put in some imagination . in that one omelet we 'll taste the whole of paris !
< u > one < /u > set . everything from midnight on --
-- no , i think they 're all in there .
i do n't know , michael . this is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'd ' .
just for a few days , sam . give me a chance to work this out by myself .
i have n't , either . but you *will* . the morons who write the books should do a little research *here* .
but is n't fuzzy just ... well , underdeveloped ?
when mom died you told me god wanted her more , loved her more --
i was wrong . nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did . not even god .
are the glory boys actually showing interest in investigation 's work ? i may have a stroke .
the glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home .
you must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the tibetans trust and good nature .
i have great hopes for the future of our co-operation .
trust you and harry lee . remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit fort louis ?
it worked . how many men can you raise ?
sure ... you 're a fine boy , ken , you really are .
okay ... you get to sleep . i 'll see you in the morning . good night .
that was n't bullshit , i said we love each other .
yeah ! ... anyway , i do n't like hotels . too much people , everyone 's got the key ... i do n't like it .
something tells me this means food . come on !
i just feel as though i 'm being made ready for the executioner .
it 's called journalism , fletch . it 's called getting both sides of the story . something you apparently do n't know anything about .
it 's also called getting me this close to being murdered .
yeah ! ... i 'm goin ' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years . gon na take the day off and go to the beach .
i can dig it . it 's gon na be hot as a motherfucker .
oh no , sir . some people are natural putterers . others can never master it .
oh my . you mean , some people are born and never will become putterers ?
yeah . i guess i did . what 's going to happen to me ?
we 're going to leave that up to detective williams . i 'll tell you though , you 're okay . you shot a real son of a bitch .
i have to do it . i ca n't stand by and watch more things go down the drain . you 're young , you do n't understand .
geez , mr crane , i do n't know . i had n't really thought about a career or stuff .
and , he gets out there and he has five strokes on us . he has more concentration than anybody i 've ever met . it 's spooky how he can concentrate .
i 'd rather play than talk about it . what did you want to see me about ? i do n't like being back here .
will you be ok now ? i 've got to go to your place to see if he 's still there . i 've got to see if it 's ... if it 's what we both think it is .
oh , no ! you 're not leaving me here all alone . i 'm going with you .
aw , lookit this , lookit this -- she 's bringin ' tampax in here . c'mon , you got nothin ' but rooms over there .
that your desk ? i 'll take this one .
oh , you 're the understudy , sort of thing ?
no . i 'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene . i just felt like doing those lines .
hey , en , nice bike'- but remember : any kids you have are gon na look just like its handsome driver .
jennifer ! this is not - repeat , not ! how we do things in this family . i 've told you never to get on one of those death traps ! please - talk to me . i promise to be reasonable .
you repeat `` third reich '' as though you expected there to be others .
well , personally , major , i will take what comes .
patrick . turn on the light . he turns on the light .
it 's a plain end , see ? so ?
i ca n't hide anymore . i breathe like a dog . i lose my balance . stealing 's got harder . caravaggio stares at the herodotus .
why do i feel if i had your book i would know everything ?
sure . and they left you upstairs to make phone calls ?
they gave me pills to make me sleep . they did n't realize how much seconal i 'm used to -- that i 'd have so much tolerance --
tell me , knox . if you 've got the story , why have n't you printed it ?
because i ... ... because she 'd never speak to me again .
the rust wo n't wait for you to read conrad , goodall .
then he should n't have written such a long poem , mr. lawford .
of course not , i never thought you were . you want to escape , right ? that 's very sane . i can help you . you want me to , do n't you ? get you out ?
if you know how to escape , why do n't you ... ?
you did n't tell me that they can be so nice , so great ... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they 're five years old .
you 're right . i did n't tell you that .
he was heavy , but we were real careful . but i do n't remember him hitting anything , anywhere .
you do n't . < u > remember < /u > .
we got ta get his money so we can get outta here -- we got ta --
that idea is over now . we 're not gon na do that now .
i know why you broke up with me in college . and not that what you did was n't messed up , but what i did was , too . so if you forgive me , i 'll forgive you .
monica , after that stuff with my dad , i could n't trust anybody , okay . i mean , i was lost . so you are forgiven . but that was five years ago . i moved on .
they burn many villages . even walled cities fall to them .
why do they burn the villages ? there 's nothing to gain .
they still have the president , it 's past their deadline and they have n't called . what do you think it means ?
like any good poker player , they 're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard .
my air is n't ... i 'm coming back .
you ca n't . counter 's at minutes . you do n't have time .
i used to joke with lamar that we were the mother and father of precrime . well , in my experience , parents often see their children as they want them to be , not as they are .
answer my question . did lamar burgess know about the minority report ?
can you go there with us now ? me and karl . we could just hang out . karl has some cool books .
frank , i just like you as a friend . only at the secret place . okay ? i ca n't go there now . i 'll see you later .
talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round .
that is a marvelous image , walter . because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around .
no , that 's fine . i was going to steal one myself but now i 've changed my mind . signed by the author , i see .
yes , we could n't stop him . if you can find an unsigned copy , it 's worth an absolute fortune .
no , i 'm sorry . i should 've made an appointment . was that anything important ?
oh that ? just mulling over business problems . examining opportunities ... exchanging rumors ... spreading gossip .
here 's the one that broke the camel 's back .
someone did n't want us to get to the party .
london ? where 's jack ? i had a strange dream .
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences .
you do n't understand a thing , do you , drag ?
luke , you got to listen to me . all you got to do is just give up nice and quiet , just play it cool .
do you have any lesions on your face at this time ?
one . here , in front of my ear .
ike , i really liked the runaway bride piece , and since i do freelance stuff for g.q. , i 'm in a different position now ...
what are you trying to say to me , fish ?
ca n't beat it with a hammer . well , since you asked , it looks like i may have a new show , a pilot being shot .
that 's wonderful . is n't that what you always wanted , a show of your own ?
i am dr. norbert woodly -- a physician , a healer . i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society . gentleness must replace violence everywhere , or we are doomed .
would you like to say something about killing , colonel ?
how does a guy get a rep like that ?
does n't matter to me . if i went down in history like adams , i 'd die happy . all they say about him today is --
and i 'll take that certified check , too . i 've decided i can handle things around here ...
come on , hildy , we 've got to keep going ! sorry , bruce , but --
absolutely not . dudley smith is a highly decorated member of this city 's police department and i wo n't smear his name without --
without what , his smearing yours first ? what 's he got on you , loew ? pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down ?
i 'm sorry i 've been acting like a jerk . i do appreciate what you 've done for me , and i know you 've done it for the best possible reasons , and i do love you , even though i act like i do n't .
that 's okay . you seem pissed off all the time , though .
`` be patient , be patient '' ... is that the only advice you can ever come up with ? ? i 've shown more patience than a dozen saints !
jeanne , you have to understand -- it 's not easy for us -- i mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well , with all due respect , by a ... girl .
but does n't the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ?
that does n't apply to me because i 'm not a criminal . i 'm not a criminal ! i was n't convicted .
there 'd never be a hole big enough . now took at me , for instance , when i was just one person , before bobby , i had so much garbage collectin ' onto me every day , i was thinkin ' about gettin a dispose all ...
a dispose-all , what 's that but more crap ? i 've never seen such crap . oofh , i do n't know how people get up in the morning .
i suppose he 's fixing it up - i know i 'd never get that through .
mr. kane is finishing your piece the way you started it .
be open with me . i 'd like that .
there may be things you 'd rather not know about .
you felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line .
my brother had shouldered that burden , allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs .
the stage frays one 's nerves ... the discipline -- it 's so exacting . discipline means doing what you do n't want to do and take no pleasure in doing . do you know what i mean ? have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline ?
i ? -- oh , no . i do only what i take pleasure in doing .
he was on the verge of something , too . he was gon na show us the next day . he said `` the answer 's not in the box , it 's in the band . '' know what it means ?
it 's only meaningful when you 've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up .
i thought you had this all figured out . good going 'irwin . '
do n't ever call me 'irwin , ' okay ?
i 'll tell you what i 'll do , brad - i 'll get drunk , too - maybe that 'll help .
no , that wo n't help . besides , you never get drunk . i wanted to talk about you and emily .
what about now , is there anything you can help me out with ?
i know they get pentangeli , that 's all i know .
we 'll work out the roller hockey thing , okay ? whatever you want , we 'll work it out . i promise .
you always say that . then you go to work and forget you promised .
will you slow down ? it 's hard enough to read this thing .
well , who told me to take this cow path ?
you were right about the telephones . there are no lines , there 's some problem .
hello tom . you 're off ? what are your plans ?
meth precursors and the dutch party favors are en route .
all i want to know is the where and the when . spare me mini moves , progress reports and bullshit .
oh no , no . you know what ? fuck that . no , you lied to me . you lied to me because you 're gutless . you 're a gutless , drunken looser .
i 'm a loser . and i 'm drunk . but i 'm not gutless .
i just left the garden , it was empty . what did you see ?
it ... was nothing . a nightmare , nothing more . go away , i --
it 's only my favorite song . it 's sonic youth doing `` superstar '' by the carpenters .
i 've heard the carpenters before . chick drummer and freaky dude . not unlike the white stripes .
ca n't you listen to me ? do n't you want to get out of here ?
why should i want to get out of here ? this is where i live .
you should n't have shown the film to frank .
i had to . it was the only way i could get at them .
it 's done with , royce . let it go .
someone screwed you over like this , left unanswered charges hanging over your head , and you 're not gon na fight back ?
yeah , what's-his-name would n't like it . the suit .
do you always have to call him that ? the suit ? it makes you sound like such a hick . his name is michael .
i 'll get undressed now . is that all right ?
sure . shall i -- i mean shall i just stand here ? i mean -- i do n't know what you want me to do .
with her family . rowan 's mother died yesterday .
rowan 's mother died at childbirth . and she does n't have . any family .
static is right ! the radio 's static , patton 's static , we 're static !
maybe it 's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh , duke ?
come on , man . do n't shut me out . i 'm telling you , you and me , that map , we can go places .
you know what , claude ? this whole time we 've been down here , you 've done nothing but think about yourself , acting like this whole thing is my fault . that plan with your cousin , did that include me ?
suave . goddam are you suave , you fucker . you want some beer ?
certainly frank . darling , get some glasses . we 'll have some beer with frank . wo n't you sit down ?
with your mother 's pull , how come you 're not a chicken colonel by now ?
lay off , i said -- if you do n't want your head handed to you .
yeah , man . let 's throw a bachelor party with drugs , booze and broads .
yeah . right . all the things that make life worth living .
he 's a worm - and i 'm gon na step on him !
to engage in a brawl ! a cheap , common brawl , in my own home ! `` i wear the pants ! '' the pants ! not even the trousers !
looking for the fossils . why should we wait until we 're in london ? this girl was probably twelve years old .
you should n't go into another man 's tent . it 's inexcusable .
roper . metro division . hostage negotiator . give me the short version .
husband came home . found that guy and his wife `` in flagrante '' . now he 's holding her at knife point .
no , i do n't . i 'm not jack ...
but they never will , dick . no matter how many elections you win , they never will .
maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
what do you mean ? you talkin ' about coppin a plea ?
who cares what he spells it ? read the letter .
dear miss laury ... i take pen in hand to let you know ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them com- anches the late mister futterman told us about ...
sir , as the enterprise left orbit , one of their support craft went down to the surface . it appeared to be the captain 's yacht . five persons on board .
we 're not waiting until morning ... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight .
you were never going to let women serve in combat . you always had a safety net . or thought you did .
jordan . i do n't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there 's more to be gained from the fight than the victory .
just came by to wrap up over there . thought i 'd say `` hello . ''
glad you did . come on in . buy you a cup of coffee ?
you played it for her and you can play it for me .
well , i do n't think i can remember it .
oh , i know . so , who 're these clients ?
couple 'a guys in from outta town . they want to see the new lesabres .
you mean , did you personally come and pee on my --
hello ! do you speak english ? parla usted inglese ? i 'll say it again . did i urinate on your rug ?
you can bring a lawyer if you wish . and you 're privileged under the constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes .
you know what you 're askin ' ? you 're askin'
yeah us golden warriors . you 're a good kid , jimmy , a good tough kid . we stick together , huh , kid ?
you was our first supreme commander , terry . keep out of sight and i 'll tell him you 're out .
i was quoting from the bible . if the shoe fits , wear it .
`` out of weariness , i spoke to my own heart ; to leave it all and to die . and i gave my heart to know madness and folly . ''
jesus . he must 've siphoned it from the cars .
if you go in , you ca n't use tear gas or flashbangs . the whole place would go up .
she might have used an alias . mary crane 's the real name , but she might 've registered ...
i do n't even bother with guests registering any more ... i mean , little by little , you drop the formalities . i should n't even bother to change the linen . i guess habits die hard . which reminds me ...
no . i do n't want to see you .
mr. lounds , you 're a reporter . you 're here to titillate your readers . if you do n't open your eyes , i 'll staple your eyelids to your forehead .
you 're worried about recouping the loan . i already told you .
no , i understand that . what i mean ... what i 'm trying to say ... i was actually wondering about ... well , my cut .
there 's still nobody in the world who can play `` as time goes by '' like sam .
he has n't played it in a long time .
he did n't even pull his pistol , huh ?
he ai n't as tough as you , kid .
you got these cops outta here . they 're comin ' in too close .
come on . i want you to see something .
two years in the women 's reformatory at framingham .
but our crime was n't burglary . it was balling white girls . they gave us the book .
well fuck , you guys could do this every day .
we 're like 7-eleven . we ai n't always doing business , but we 're always open .
oh , it 's just marriage in general you 're not enthusiastic about , huh ?
no , marriage is all right for harry , and marty , and sam and you .
do you need a large sum of money ? legal counsel ?
no , no , i 'm definitely not asking for anything . except maybe mercy . like , it would be really great if nobody hit me .
but ... where was this man gardiner before last week ?
apparently the white house shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation , and , according to our sources , neither the f.b.i . nor the c.i.a . has met with success .
that 's fine with me ... get it ? fine . a fine ! hey c'mon , c'mon , what is this , an audience or a jury ?
miss farmer , is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night ?
yes , sir . general , can i ask a question ?
certainly , major mandrake . you 're a good officer , and you can ask me a question any time you want to .
it 's the way of all martyrs , is n't it ?
give me back my anonymity , that 's all i ask ! let me be invisible again !
the world is going to end pretty soon if you do n't learn fast . look , why not make yourself useful ? i 'm just about out of smokes . go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias .
twenty dollars is a lot of money . are you sure you can trust me with it ? i mean , are n't you afraid i might steal it ?
of course . well , we should all go out onto the terrace .
oh no , really . she has her book .
you touched him -- - and saw him ... ? what was he doinging . kinky ... ?
it 's come to that , huh ... ? three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life ... ?
we 're really gon na be in a movie ! ?
that 's right , evan , and you get to be the star .
is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that ?
no . that is what you get for distracting me .
well , mr. bernstein , you were with mr. kane from the very beginning -
from before the beginning , young fellow . and now it 's after the end . anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
come on , it 's our only senior prom .
deaf ears , mr. nelson . i answer to a higher power .
i might call to check up on her , you know ... to see if she 's better ?
she 's fine , really..do n't you worry.. just needs some rest..she 's had a very long trip .
the cobra 's waitin ' to strike , chica .
that guy sailor came around this afternoon ... asked me if there was a contract out on 'im .
i know , but since we 're talking , i thought i 'd mention it .
we 're not talking , you 're talking , and doing too damn much of it , if you ask me .
my shift ends at four , but i could n't --
meet me at 4:01 , top of the run . that 'll give you a minute to freshen up .
you know , eddie , i 'm not as much of a chump , and a patsy , a yokel as you think .
how much is a shave and a haircut , roger ?
did you use the sword that you held in your hand ?
no , i ... i held it up to ...
leave her alone ! you 're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard .
have tom hagen meet me in the harbor house .
harry , what 's the matter with you ? tell them the truth . we 're married , we have a daughter --
i do n't know what this crazy bitch is on . you should just cut her loose , so we can get down to business .
do n't i have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school ?
but papa -- you need all the help you can get .
eddie , i do n't understand . why are < u > you < /u > the most qualified director for the christine jorgensen story ?
aw , er , it 's just a bunch of hot air . i had to say something to get in the door .
well , if it is n't the ripper hisself .
are those < i > my < /i > suits ?
that 's a face you do n't forget -- he was there too --
herman scobie . and you 've never seen him before , either ?
she 's very beautiful . she 's much younger than i am . and she 's rich , i hope .
rich ? i have n't the faintest idea . why ?
just cool down , son . i ai n't accusing you of anything . serves toby right to get his ass whooped . if you had n't done it , somebody else would 've .
is there a problem up the road , sheriff ?
are you tellin ' me nobody knows what he looks like ? come on , there must be witnesses somewhere .
juntao 's standing orders were to kill everyone . there were never witnesses .
i 'd prefer not to be the president to push the button if i can avoid it .
the longer we wait , the less accessible the hostages will be , mr. president .
well , in times like these most people are cutting salaries , but suppose we say , in your case , three hundred and fifty ?
oh , madame , you 're just too sweet for words !
so help me ! all i wan na do is meditate ! !
andy , do n't raise your voice . we do n't wish your presence here .
mrs. wilson from the telephone company . i understand you 're having problems with obscene calls .
yes , i am ... i 'm sorry mrs. wilson ... it 's driving me crazy ... i 've changed my number twice already ... please help me !
yeah , well i never wanted to get slaughtered much .
well , most guys do n't . i mean that 's the point . you all mind if i take my vitamins ?
the kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a jesuit . a french jesuit .
i think he 's going to come for me . not just because i know who he is , but because i hurt him . only i do n't think he 'll try again as lowe .
the police used him as a witness in this case .
i 'll be at bedford tonight , if you need me .
that is bullshit ! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho . i ca n't believe you 're saying this , marylin ! there 's nothing wrong with us . we 're attractive and charismatic and successful and ... i like us .
i 'm sorry miles . you should n't listen to me . i 'm sure you have a very fulfilling life . i 'd better go . i 'm depressing .
talk to him . tell him how you feel .
it 's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when i was consigliere to sonny .
now i know i did n't hurt nobody when i was drunk - -
of course , not , charlie . i never thought you did .
there 's no limits to where he can strike , and we 've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days . it happened like this before , in , when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach , in long island .
a shark 's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you ca n't avoid it !
and that 's why you 're losing your bet ?
i 'm not losing the bet . it 's just taking longer than i expected .
how do you know he 's still not here ?
guys like me take those chances . let 's go .
do you think she will give us the designs ?
eventually . these things are always a matter of leverage .
what ? the dead guy ? she 'll get over fucking the dead guy . shit , my mom 's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years ; i call him dad .
caitlin and i ca n't be together . it 's impossible .
have you ever talked to carl - tried to see his side ?
'his ' side ? i 've seen it , all right . a nice , bright yellow !
she 's younger than i am . did she tell you that ? how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you ?
you , however , had time to hide the gun , did n't you , chutney ? after you shot your father ?
i do n't think she will . she 's a slut , but i just do n't think she 's that mean . jasmine 'll bring her around ...
jasmine ... do you have yesterday 's show on tape , by any chance ?
i am ... grateful for what you have given me . but i still do not wish to be assimilated .
a universe of sensation is waiting for you ... do n't you want to explore it ... with me ?
that 's not going to be the way we say good-bye . even though i think what you did was rotten -- it 's not all impersonal . you mean something to me .
you keep coming after me and looking down on me . it 's starting to make me batty .
it was ... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part .
wow . so you made love . ooo , i hear the birds chirping .
... i have never met a man who was so well beloved .
... he was < u > wealthy < /u > ...
good day to our brothers-in-arms . have you come to join us ?
i am looking for monsieur george varlac who resides in the rue de frelicot . do you know him , monsieur ?
mr. mitchell stephens , esquire , would you be likely to sue me if i was to beat you right now ? beat you so bad that you pissed blood and could n't walk for a month . because that 's what i 'm about to do .
no , mr. ansel . i would n't sue you .
have i flipped out ? ... is any of this real ?
it 's all real . look . the storage tanks for the whales .
you good-lookin ' sumbitch ... do n't you ever die !
that 's your line for tonight , ya know .
that mcp , you know , that 's half the problem right --
the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do . i ca n't sit and worry about every little user request that --
my friends , i am not a rash , impulsive person . i 'm not given to wild , unsupported statements . we must evacuate this planet immediately !
you are one of krypton 's greatest scientists jor-el -
you 're telling me some white boy is gon na direct this pilot ?
i just want you to meet him . keep an open mind .
wanted to see how good you were . i 'm hoping we might work together .
may i say something , no offence ? you look like a gigolo , you sound like a thief , you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind ?
you would n't get mixed up with that little rotter , would you ?
no ? give me a chance , baby . money is music in my ears , and when his old man kicks off there 'll be a million dollar tune .
i 'm going to see a man called julian cross . ever heard of him ?
is the pope catholic ? who are you , mister ? ... i ask because he does n't see a whole lot of people .
what 's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out ?
he 's top man in astro and nuclear physics . he knows all about meteors !
what the fuck do you know about my people ?
only that you 're all tough undeluded motherfuckers . and that it 's not in your nature to let me go .
hey , lady , i got faults , i know i 'm not perfect but i do n't get this at all , your attitude . i saved your ...
a lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet ... blackmailing a national hero ...
left ? when ? i just come from his place and there was no one there . a neighbour of his ...
no . i meant he left as in no longer works here .
mapping the fucking pig genome . we 'll call your dad , he 's a neurosurgeon --
it 's three a.m. i 'm not supposed to be here . i snuck out --
do n't worry , mr. baker . we 'll knock him out . he wo n't feel a thing .
i think maybe i 'll bring him back next week ...
would you shut the fuck up ? you hear what i 'm doing ?
yeah man . i 'm jealous . you 're always great , benny . `` her name is g-i-n-a gina and she lo-oooves me . '' i did say chicken !
course maybe you do n't have to wait until i faint .
no , i think i will , it 's safer . i have patience .
take care of mr. whale like he was your flesh and blood .
it is my job . i did it when he was happy and it was easy . it is only fair i do it now when he is ill. enough talk . i must wake up the master .
well ... i ... i do n't want to be rude , but ... it 's generally known that --
generally known ! what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots ?
you have to go . he 'll never stop . leave this place . find another .
i 'll go . we 'll both go . far away .
it 's getting so a girl ca n't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies . hello , post ... mr. walter burns , please .
well , hildy , we were only saying that a swell reporter like you would n't give this up so easily .
gee . sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it .
well , they have n't got me yet , baby . dig up some ice from the kitchen and let 's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise .
it 's 1:45 , i told you there 's no one to pick up annab ...
but you 're not < u > done < /u > !
really ? no . not at all . you 're a very pretty girl . you should know that . you should be confident .
thank you so much . merci . it 's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment .
i just want you there in case there 's trouble .
and if there is , then zero can kill someone ?
i love your early work . `` was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium ? ''
i have a new one nearly done , and better . the massacre at paris .
you are bringing in wrong values . love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological , or shall we say chemical , process . a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it .
oh , i see . what do you use instead ?
well here we are a family again . been so long plain forgot how good it feels . want to thank you for that , wyatt . all your doin ' .
we 're gon na do it , boys . gon na get ours . feel it in my bones . all we have to do is keep our eyes on that brass ring .
they are brutes without feeling . though i admit that i 've requested cremation for myself . burial is an archaic tradition , even more ridiculous now than it ever was . to say nothing of the ... spacing problem ... on a small island like this .
i thought the purpose of decapitation was to ... to ...
we 've got get out of here , we got get out of here .
think , think . try to open the lid , try to kick a hole in the wood .
sweetheart , you 're okay . you 're okay . you 're okay .
never had a doubt . never did . us kirby men , we stick around , huh ?
say it anyway . come on , how much do you love me ?
`` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
what 's the matter ? is n't it cheap enough ? a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars !
let me get this straight . you want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars ?
the leads , the overhead , the telephones , there 's lots of things .
what do you need ? a telephone , some broad to say `` good morning , '' nothing ... nothing ...
if you did want one , how 'd you go about getting one ?
from someone who did n't want to have a baby .
nice to meet you . i 'm marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans . she 's here to take the pictures .
y'all have a seat . is this all of you ?
is this all the display space we can get ?
i tried to get more , but this is the limit . the de vries line has the same area .
lay off pittsburgh . it 's one of the great cities .
if it can produce a miss sloviak you 'll get no argument from me .
you contacted us . we were simply listening . we 've been listening for millions of years .
and those other docking ports i saw ... i mean ... there are others ?
do we simply ask him where he 's hidden it ?
sam , that old woman , whoever she is . i think she told arbogast something ! and i want her to tell us the same thing !
he 'd have to be crazy . where 's sidney ?
she 's with my sister . should i bring her in ?
why do n't you just go outdoors , mister ? cool off .
cool off , huh ? how 's this for cooling off ?
mom , you hitched all the way to berkeley once , remember ?
mom , just give me five more minutes . just five minutes , okay ?
but it is n't right , paulie . that tommy , he 's making trouble for me all over town . i ca n't go here . i ca n't go there .
you ? you think you 're the only one ? i 've talked to them a million times , but they do n't listen .
first of all , maam , i never touched your daughter and second , i would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines .
oh do n't give me any of that racist crap . my husband and i gave money to colin powell .
lamar burgess thinks that you left john because he lost himself in precrime instead of you .
i left him because every time i looked at him , i saw my son . every time i got close to him , i smelled my little boy . that 's why i left him . and now you can leave .
it 's the best opera yet written . i know it ! why did n't they come ?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , my friend . do you know you did n't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap ?
i would n't trade ya for a brass spittoon !
yeah ! it 's supposed to be made outta pure gold !
you know what a mixer ball is ? it 's like you , you come out of nowhere and upset things , scattering everything all over . buzz grumpily waves at him to sit .
what are you doing over at the lanes that 's so dangerous , buzz ?
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs .
a word ? im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover .
i could swear i had a '63 chateau latour in here . you have n't seen it , have you ?
i doubt i 'd recognize a '63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it .
me too ... hey ... if it gets dull a little before 11:00 , drop by the studio .
i 'm not sure i 'll be able to ... i ...
i wan na help you , but i do n't wan na be locked in the trunk of no car .
you think i wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass ?
well , nobody , i guess . but that father barry , i did n't like the way he kept lookin ' at me .
he was looking at everybody the same way . asking the same question .
unbelievable . look ... here . i do n't know what 's going on . that 's so much baloney . i 've got enough cash for one night , okay ?
that 's fine , mr. kesher . you can pay cash when you check out . i 'm sorry . it was my duty to inform you .
mr. grant . did you read that script i was talking about ?
uh ... yes . not for us . no woman in jeopardy . find me dr. quinn medicine woman . find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women .
this is a fine thing . maybe we 've missed him already .
how can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like ?
what are you < u > doing < /u > ? you just ca n't go ... ..besides , she 'd never drink anything that looks like that .
okay we 'll use this . she wo n't be able to tell what she 's drinking .
tell you what . i 'll book you on some concerts , and meanwhile , we 'll show the special around ... see if somebody wants to buy it --
yeah , we can have a garage sale . `` hey look , i got a floor lamp and a network tv special for only fifty cents ! ''
tell me the truth . am i a female fog bank ?
you 're not seriously buying into darren 's nonsense .
oh yeah ? can you think of something to charge me with ?
when i do , you 'll hear about it .
i read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl . i 'm that girl 's fianc .
oh ... i 'm sorry i have to rush but i 've got to write a story about this thing that just happened ... tell me exactly how it all turned out .
come on , alex . come for walkies . hahahahaha .
come , come , my little droogies . i just do n't get this at all . the old days are dead and gone . for what i did in the past i 've been punished .
you mean you did n't have any gay thoughts when you were my age ...
well , uh ... promise me you wo n't do anything until you 're .
john : take that look offen your face and act nice .
he do n't mean no impudence ; do you , boy ? do you , boy ? ah , many 's the time poor brother ben told me about these youngins .
okay , chaz , i hear you . i 've got you on my board .
good . i 'm getting you clear too . let 's just keep the line open .
i mean , your amazement . i could have understood it in any of your companions , but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds . or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it ?
mr. chang , if you do n't mind , i think i 'll go on being amazed - in moderation , of course .
you 're barking up the wrong tree , hartman .
i 'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is .
so here is my candidate . what do you think ?
but what about school records ? homer does n't have any *diplomas* ...
faith , we know about jeriko . iris made me a copy of the tape .
oh god , lenny . i was trying to keep you out of this .
... the opinions of others , and you went right along with them , is n't that the truth ?
yes , that 's the truth . but i was pushed into that fountain , and that 's the truth , too .
what 's your fucking problem ? you 're a shithead !
i just want to see how much bullets it takes .
i 'm going to move to a smart hotel , tomorrow if it 'll make you feel better . let 's talk about tomorrow . wan na do something ?
sure ... tonight . then please stay at my place .
as long as there 's a pile-up , we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest .
it 's a technique ugly john and i worked out in case something like this came up .
absolutely . listen , barnett , i understand your position .
no , you do n't , so do n't say you do . bunch of damn liars . what do you get out or this ?
i wondered about them , for so many years . i wondered if i looked like them , acted like them . i wondered why they gave me up .
giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded `` heaven , '' they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours .
the terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations , increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies . can i tell you more ?
no -- wait -- the moon 's falling out of orbit -- that 's not possible !
well , i think you 'd be a sensation in pictures .
but what bout accent ? some people tink i haf too much accent .
i 'm sorry . i was asleep . i must have fallen asleep .
you look ghastly , tom . are you okay ?
it does n't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it would n't stay in the city 
sure -- certainly - but what 's that got to do with this ?
so , what kind of stuff do you guys do together ? is she into old records and stuff ?
sort of ... she does n't dislike any of that stuff ... she 's trying , anyway ... actually , we 're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon ...
leave shangri-la ! that 's not likely . you could n't drive her out .
no , i mean about her appearance . if she should leave the valley - what would happen ?
oh . sure -- if it would make a good scene .
you do n't care . do you ? but hundreds of thousands of people will carel
i do n't like it , i do n't like it one bit . we shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity . we 'd be half way to new york by now .
we 'd be in the hole by now . hey , man , you 're peeing on my shoe .
i just made this picture , over at screen classics . it opens next week .
screen classics ? hmm , do n't know them .
your partner 's through . department scapegoat on the chief 's orders . he 's been billed , he 'll be indicted and he 'll swing .
him and me both . < u > fucking exley < /u > .
maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio , which is now working . same report milholland heard . and < u > that < /u > makes him get the lantern fast . before the freighter 's wake can bang it around .
but you < u > could < /u > be wrong . he < u > could < /u > have climbed up earlier .
i suppose you see a piece of this for yourself ?
well , it 's my plan . we 're in this together .
you still do n't believe me , do you ?
it 's a long detour to dead lake . what would we find ?
levi , i do n't know if you 're familiar with investigative work , but we have this little thing called `` motive '' and you just gave yourself one .
you said you wanted to know what happened -- i 'm telling you the truth .
it 's a good , honest business , is n't it ?
oh sure , it 's honest . but somehow , i ca n't picture you with a guy who sells policies .
using filthy language in front of the customers ... you should both get fired .
we 're sorry , ma'am . we got a little carried away .
but he never ends up marrying her . strange .
weird . why do n't i slip into something comfortable ?
okay , we got ... one , two ... three ... two caddies and poe 's mustang .
could be worse . i do n't know how , but i 'm sure it could .
and what will you do with the big , big , money ? have you not everything you need ? if you need a motor-car , you pluck it from the trees . if you need pretty polly , you take it .
brother , you think and talk sometimes like a little child . tonight we pull a mansize crast .
there you are darling ... have we met , lewis lane , oasisburg times .
oh , how long have you had your own route ?
i guess it 's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach ...
not < u > any < /u > car . i like to keep a variety . i 'm always looking for the new experience , like this one . i liked it .
thank you . but when you take these cars do n't you think you are wronging the owners ?
wait a minute ! that was thirty years after daddy . do you think ... ?
i do n't know . i 'm completely in the dark here . that 's what i get for moving away .
look , the man may be a fellow vulcan , but that does n't ...
no , no , no , captain . you do not understand . sybok also in a son of sarek .
it sounds like you 're doin ' really super .
yah , well , i , uh ... it 's not that it did n't work out - linda passed away . she , uh ...
i 'm no cop . i want some action .
i saw . $ fifteen minutes . $ half hour .
i 'm sure i would n't know , ma'am ... and buffalo hunting too ... hmmmmm ?
and jus when my baby 's out on some texas road with a killer .
we fight , she gets the clown -- how 's that happen ?
shut up -- i like this song ... april in paris , this is a feeling , no one can ever reprieve ...
you can not . i 'm still editor of this sheet .
all right , you said i was fired . well , i quit ! give the assignment to somebody else .
listen . if that guy lays an egg . i want to get something out of it . i 'm getting a jane doe ready !
that 's fine , honey . now , get out !
i just realized this is for television , is n't it ? i ca n't swear up and down like i just did .
it 's fine . i can bleep it out .
these strange stories you write -- they come naturally , do they ?
naturally ? -- that 's not the word i would have chosen .
... there 's plenty of movies around here . i have n't seen any of them , but i 'm sure they 're good .
no , travis . you 're a sweet guy and all that , but i think this is it . i 'm going home .
because i can deliver the actual noc list . the one you have is not only worthless , it 's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location .
it 's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say i ca n't look at the information and < u > see < /u > if it 's worthless . not a tenable position , sir .
i do n't know who you insult more ; her or me .
`` part the gates of heaven , '' as it were --
is it because of the hookers , sir ? you tell them there 's no crime in being lonely .
no , carter . the reason i 'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to hong kong . and what the hell is heaven on earth ?
of course , he 's concealed about me person .
no ... he 's must have slipped off somewhere .
i 'm the only person you 've told ? that 's a great line . does that make other girls swoon ? do they actually eat up this bullshit ?
i could n't give a shit if you believe me or not , and frankly i 'm too tired to prove it to you .
well , i know , more so . that 's why i was thinking ... maybe she 'd be better off .
better off ? how could she ever find love and happiness , if you did what you 're talking about ? are you insane ?
i always lock my files . and you were the only one here today ... what do you mean , you son of a bitch ?
you know what i mean . i saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer . and a lotta strange people .
seems to like some of the same places you do . funny you never met .
yeah , real funny . you 're wrong about this , i could get busted on the spot .
i 'm a little embarrassed . i 'm not used to losing control with such -- volume .
and i 'm not used to -- marylin -- there 's something i want to ask you .
i do n't know . perhaps he met somebody .
obviously . one ticket of passage to south america -- one letter , stamped but unsealed , addressed to you --
the munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the wicked witch of the east .
oh . but , if you please -- what are munchkins ?
burgel gave me this -- what does it mean ?
burgel ! -- i did n't leave it with him .
compared to you , my friend , shapeley 's an amateur . whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this ! you 're positively the most conceited
hey , wait a minute ! let 's get something straightened out right now . if you 've any peculiar ideas that i 'm interested in you , forget it . you 're just a headline to me .
someone help me ! i 'm still alive , only i 'm very badly burned .
some of you i know , some of you i 'm meeting for the first time .
hail to the chief ! we-all got a responsibility , men . he 's crowned like a king ought to be , but he ca n't just walk to the mess hall by himself . he has to be carried by native bearers .
good thinking , duke . how about it , ho-jon ? can you round up a few of the boys ?
he took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies . this is all in your statement , lara ...
he shot a hole in the damn ceiling . so what ? you lose your son , let 's see how well you handle it .
so we 'll take him with us . at least 'til we get back to the hummer .
he 'd just slow us down , and drink our water . and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he 'd sell us out .
i did n't even need to change this gasket , just put in a little hydraulic fluid .
stop it . when you talk like that , i get turned on and it frightens me .
well , i ... i had n't thought about it that much . i was thinking ... well , it 's an idea , the girl is oversexed , and ...
rose is n't oversexed , that 's ridiculous . if you 're going to talk nonsense , i do n't want to talk to you at all . rose is exactly the same as the rest of us , except more so .
when you get the ak , open up . you got me ? open up .
you 're crazy ! ! ! ... no way ! ... now you 're crazy ! ! ! you 're completely crazy ! ! !
the developing room . i need to ... see you .
i want to see you , too , francis ... should i come over ?
my mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner .
are you kidding ? i 'll be down in a `` i-crapped-my-pants . ''
you have to be careful what you say in front of the others ... they frighten easy . it 's always been that way , most men frighten easy .
we 're making a big investment in cuba . that 's my only concern .
well , you and junior have the same name , too , do n't you ?
yeah , but he 's my son . nothing strange about that . he 's my own flesh and blood . but here you got the same name as this man here , and you 're not even the same color .
huh ? i give it up . but this not knowing where you 're going is exciting anyway .
well , mr. conway , for a man who is supposed to be a leader , your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing .
do n't shoot me . mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder ...
for christ 's sake . mason trudges down the tu=3del . goodspeed follows him .
um , clear ? i 'm sorry ... about before . i ...
your entire world view just went out the window . i could n't expect a religious conversation overnight . we 'll get through this . i promise .
you 're on your way to a contempt citation , young lady .
that 's fine with me ... get it ? fine . a fine ! hey c'mon , c'mon , what is this , an audience or a jury ?
oh , nothing out of the ordinary . growing old .
we 're all getting a bit long in the tooth .
doctor , we have a hard problem in psychological profiling . i want to ask for your help with a questionnaire .
`` we '' being the behavioral science unit , at quantico . you 're one of jack crawford 's , i expect .
blade does n't talk about the old days much .
blade does n't talk about anything much . what about you , though ?
what is that smile on your face ? is there anything wrong with me ?
now , jabez ! i 've got on my sunday bonnet and i 'm going to church with my husband . almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that is n't an occasion , i do n't know what is .
i do n't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that .
hey , relax guy . it 's just a cruel joke . rich , chocolatey snacky smores are only available up on earth . he 'll never get 'em , see ?
but just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times ... maybe even just before we left , while i was waiting outside your place ...
so , even if i did say them , i was sincere with her , as i am now with you .
i am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and v.c.r.s . there 's four thousand here .
zuzu petals . sounds like a drug . a lethal one .
ever wonder why the dalmation 's the symbol of the firehouse ?
first organized fire department was on the border of dalmatia and sardinia in the year .
hey take it easy man . they 're scared .
they 're scared ? what about me ! i 'm sick of this shit man , i 'm sick of this shit ! they do n't want us here ! who do you think they 're fighting for ! get outta there !
yeah , we check you into mt . hebron for a few days , run lots of tests , charge a bundle . you can pull your pants up now .
i hope they still fit . do i get to keep the glove ?
we 're going to be patient . if we start flashing money around , buying fancy cars and fancy clothes , people are going to ask questions .
well , we wo n't do any of that shit !
i 'll meet you on one condition - i get exclusivity and you surrender to me .
we 'll talk about that . four o'clock gives you time to go to bank . three hundred thousand dollars .
nine to five it 's a pulitzer prize , i know .
i was going to say that there 's only one 'p ' in subpoena . what the hell did you major in at radcliffe ? middle english ? nice job on the teamster 's update , kent .

i 'm aware that i do n't look so great , but i thought you 'd be glad to see me .
no ! well , well , well ! that 's all right , if you like it . can anybody do that ?
oh no , sir . some people are natural putterers . others can never master it .
yes , mr. webster -- it was here where it all began .
i see . and this is where he 'd like to collect , too .
no we should n't , but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime !
oooooweee ! ! you shoulda seen me ! like i 'd been doin ' it all my life ! nobody would ever believe it .
it 's really too bad you have to miss the grand finale .
i thought you liked me being in the audience . do n't you want me to see it ?
okay , look , you swim to the rig and come back with another suit .
seven , eight minute swim each way ... not enough time . look at this ... time i get back you 'll be --
... ..have you ever seen this..i mean , never mind , you said --
i work as a nurse , for a proffesion --
you 're kind of a sellout , are n't you ? what would the melvins say ?
they 'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home .
you 're not going to lose the house . everybody has three mortgages these days .
but at nineteen percent interest ! you did n't even bargain with the guy .
that 's good goddamn work , ray . let the salmon run . let 'em run upriver .
why we setting eagle bear up as an informant ?
no -- i was just talking to one of the guys at the office .
oh . i wonder what 's keeping mother ? she was supposed to come down and get you .

i do know . i 'm a cop . this is what i do .
can we buy into their ipo ? or is that a justice dept . problem ?
there is no public offering . the guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in san luis obispo . 'wrote this just to run their web site .
oh , i do n't know . maybe i was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
oh no , amy , pardon me for saying so but i find that very farfetched .
this is like my every wet dream come true . i do n't even care that you 're here , too , bro .

ma ! please ! you 're driving me crazy .
driving you crazy ? do n't get me started . you 're here a month and sometimes i know he does n't come home at all . what kind of people are these ?

hah ! jewish guilt . well , it wo n't work on me hammer . i 'm too strong for it .
where is your daughter ? she might be able to give us some information .
she 's at school . we 've tried not to upset her more than she 's been .
many thanks . you 're patterson , yes ? nigel starling- i 'll be assisting you at tsavo- but surely beaumont must have told you that .
he just gave me his `` monster '' speech .
god ! and why did n't you come tonight ? we all had a terrific time . i really think you would have enjoyed yourself .
i 'm going through a period of my life where i just ca n't be around people . i did n't want to wind up abusing anyone .

you do n't , i 'll call you . oh ! i have a tape recording that i am sure will interest you .
-- i am the sea , which covers the desert forever under its weight .
-- i am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea , escaping ...
you were n't straight with us , frankie , what else could we do ?
we could have talked first , saved a lot of running around .
oh yeah . who cares ? i 'm the queen of typos . wow , this is really starting to open up . what do you think ?
my palate 's kind of shot , but from what i can tell , i 'd dub it pretty damn good .
who are you , the serial killer police ? what difference does it make ?
it 's not historically accurate , that 's all .

where the fuck are they going ? to butcher a sheep ? i thought this was a robbery .
where did they get those outfits from ? have n't we got some like that , tom ?
she 's a little jealous , i think . and confused when it comes to men ... so where are we going ?
well , first i thought patina , and then the ivy , but then i thought of somewhere a little more romantic . like my place .
they went after castro . in some crazy way it got turned on kennedy . i do n't think the `` p '' knows what happened , but he 's afraid to find out . it 's got him shitting peach pits .
christ , we created frankenstein with those fucking cubans .
well , i 'm not sure that was . christ ! they better get the guy .
uncle al , what if it 's not a guy ?
i 'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you .
say , you could do anything with me you wanted to . putty - just putty , that 's me . now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if i kind of got closer so i could see them ?
look , you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again . we 're watching her very carefully ... this woman has been into laudanum . it 's a controlled experiment , but i suspect we 'll need your cooperation before this thing is over .
well , certainly ... we 're always happy to cooperate with the police ...
hello , hildy ! what are you doing around here ?
i want to interview earl williams , warden . how about a little service ?

they ca n't reduce nuclear fuel . but once the reactor 's miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it .
that 's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit .

maybe you do . y'know i 'm starting to like this game -- baseball 's a helluva good way to make a living .
leonard does not hold a driving licence . as for his passport , i do not know where he keeps it .

there are a thousand things ... why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch ? is this a punishment ? are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell ? and how long is this going to < u > last < /u > ?
i do n't see anything about 'rewards and punishments ' or 'heaven and hell . ' this book reads like stereo instructions ! listen to this ... 'geographical and temporal perimeters ... functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation . ' this is going to take some time .
should n't be bad . might even help . but my guess is we 're going to have to paddle our way back .
we 'll worry about that later . okay , i 'll take damage reports .

i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place ... do you ever think about stuff like that ?
i guess i probably used to when i was your age .
it would n't hurt to hear the plan , i guess .
alright . the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later .

bela , somebody misplaced the motor . so when you wrestle the octopus , shake the legs a bit , to make it look like it 's killing you .

that smell 's still fillin ' this room good .
i do n't know - i do n't remember anything that happened before the revolution . . .

alex , how shouldi know ? i 'm just a girl .

she was raised in a funeral home , she knows a thing or two about it .
i do n't know ... three , four weeks .
much less than that . an hour and a half .
that 's a lie ! listendo n't believe what he says . . .
let go of me ! this man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building ! he was paid to say so ! do you deny that ?
i want to reach people . nobody listens to me . this is my way to reach them .
to reach people , you have to feel something first ... you write about the wrong things . how can you feel for dog food ? the people at the gazette do n't respect it , and neither do you .
catholicism is not on trial here . i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else ...

nothing so glamorous ... actually , i 'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters .
toto , are you pulling my leg or something ? how is it possible to see this television without film ?
just so , alfredo . there is n't any . and if you buy a television set , you can watch it at home , without any fuss ...
that 's not the point . four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
oh , it wo n't . believe me . and it 's not going to happen again . from now on , nobody is going to use my apartment --
air france . glasgow . direct , but then you 're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds . that 's nine one two . it 's up to you .
yes , the first one 's fine . heathrow direct .

half the pilots down here fly drugs ... he 's always going off ... .

your friend 's ship ? oh , man . i must 've walked onto the wrong yacht . i knew there was a reason my keys did n't work .
i put a gun right here ... ... and i tell him , 'sign the paper marty or your fuckin ' dead . ' like that .
i wonder , would that work ? you know who i see for al roxy ? harvey keitel . the man could do it in his sleep .
not native american myths and legends . i 'm with the fbi , walter , remember ? not national geographic .
what you call myths , we call our history .
you 're right . probably penis , mouth and neck .
all right ! here 's another one . 'the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first , you climax first , you and your mate climax together ? '
aye , sir . on course to ceti alpha . all is well .

the bills are right here . you did n't say what you wanted .
jack , it must be so terrible for you , to be trapped here on this island , all over again .
ah , well ... the company is better than last time . and the scenery has definitely improved .
you do n't need to know the details of this mission ... you 're better off if you do n't .
you 're right ... i do n't . i just need to know that this thing is out of here ! you hear me , roger ramjet ?
i never laid a hand on her in anger . not a day . not even when i 's drinkin ' . but this business got me wonderin ' what a good shake and slap would do for her .
that kind of talk is between us . do n't you go in there with that shit on your tongue .
that monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away . never fails .
that 's not compliment , melvin ... that 's just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid ... a compliment is something nice about somebody else ... now or never .
there was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs .
i thought , and correct me if i 'm wrong , but were n't you trying to play both sides ?
clark . . . it does n't matter . . . we can move . . .
do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside ?
too bad it did n't happen to miser stevens .
are you one of old stevens ' customers too ?
listen , elena , if you 're gon na pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
your unfaithfulness -- that 's what i 'm trying to talk about . your unfaithfulness . your betrayal . your dalliance . and you wo n't do me the dignity of being up front about it .
matter ? with me ? nothing 's the matter .
otis , were you up to your old tricks ?
this is ohio . if you do n't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress .
oh , you 're so smart . how about a little heterosexuality before we go ?
i thought you said you never did an honest day 's work in your life .
well , not to say mr. lindgren is dishonest , exactly .
w-why ? you do n't think it 's realistic ?
no , i did n't , i , that 's no . no , i- i-i , no , i-i just ... hate to see you put yourself in a position where , where you get hurt , you know . you know , you know how you take ...
you destroyed his memory ! his mind ! his identity ! and , you want to do the same to me !
bailiff ! stop this outburst ! gag that monstrosity !
he told you and you let him do it .
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go .
ouch ! eat ? you can do a solo if you do n't step on it . i 'm going to bow out on you .
what 's the rush ? there 's no first act . they 'll all be there and we do n't have to appear at any particular time .
you must have been some tail gunner ! go ahead , cookie .
come on , let 's get that mail . anything for stanislaus kuzawa ?
why do i get the feeling when you say some time , you mean some time .
i was already here a good many years when they came in in .
they did n't think he 'd be so cagey , that 's all . they 'll get him next time .
use salino . it 'll take a little longer , but there wo n't be any holes in it .
the network is on an intranet . it 's a direct feed into our computer system .
your station wo n't have any easier time contacting the military than i did .
so he 's got this catalogue of women touching themselves ? that does n't make you feel weird ?
no . i do n't think they all did what i did .
i think maybe you 've got your dates mixed up .
but how ? where do you place paul that night ?
or in dreams either . i repressed it completely . classic pattern of inhibition .
that 's what you 've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on ? repressing your real self ?
'course . larry wildman . one of the first raiders .
sir larry wildman . like all brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in ... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole rdl pharmaceuticals right out from under me . wildman the white knight .
sit down , woman , sit down . you like me , do n't you ?
i 'd be really ungrateful , if i did n't like you , sir ; you took me and my little girl in when i did n't know where to turn .

i would n't want you to marry me just to prove something .
you 've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me ... margo , tell me what 's behind all this .
now remember ... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence .
i know . but if it is a trap then why are we going ?
i appreciate your cooperation . i 'm looking for a missing girl ... ... this girl here , denise willis ... have you seen her ?
well , i ... mmmmm ... no , i ai n't seen her , sorry .

a little more was taken out before . my brother 's a director of that bank , mr. mccoy ... i had a few pressing debts .
i do n't suppose you 'll ever tell her , will you ?
she is very young -- i have an old habit of failure . it would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage .
yarbles , great bolshy yarblockos to you i 'll meet you with chain , or nozh or britva , any time , not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless . it stands to reason , i wo n't have it .

you were lucky today , vice boy . captain said to leave it alone , but just remember , i 'm watching you .
i 'm sorry , detective , but you 're just not my type .
i said it 's not worth the fight . steward , please .
we 'll just say it was in bad taste .
why do n't you try letting her in , steve  i mean shenge .
get up . she wo n't buy anything if she sees me working on it !
i 've been looking at the duty roster ... at the shack hours outstanding ...
uh , oh ... i see where this is going ...
we need to narrow this down somehow ... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests .
maybe i do n't want to meet someone who shares my interests . i hate my interests ! where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself ?
it does n't sound too bad . i 'll try and stay awake .
oh . well , thank you very much . it 's very nice of you . your vote of confidence is overwhelming . all right . the princess bride , by s. morgenstern . chapter one . buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin .

we need those flights . we have to know when those missiles become operational , because when they do , we need to destroy them .
fair enough . but castro 's on alert and we 're flying attack planes over their sites , on the deck . there 's no way for them to know they 're carrying cameras , not bombs . they 're going to be shot at , plain and simple .
in cheyene walk ? lucy 's going to have a meltdown . oh , i 'm so sorry .
i should have damn well bought it . well , we ca n't afford it . the movie 's going to eat up a year of my life and i 'm getting paid next to nothing . do you know how much skye davidson 's getting ? four million .
it may not have been an accident . they never did find her head ...
her 'head ' ? ! you 're making this up ...
the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects .
only part . what else ? what did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because joan of arc told him to do it .
you 've lost interest ... you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex .
i was never much of a sweater . you know that .
i got ta make a report to fish and game . i was just wondering , that 's all . what 'd he do , to shoot himself , i mean ?
who the fuck knows ? musta slipped or something . i just heard the gun go off .

these blast patterns are consistent with type iii disruptors .

here . here . is this enough money ? ! huh ? will it last you two fuckin ' days ? take it , greedy bitch . take the fuckin ' money you fuckin ' want .
i 'm going to the bank and i 'm getting my jewelry too !
it 's a suicide note . says he killed jack because jack had figured out a pornography scam patchett was running .
he had help getting up there . two of his fingers are broken .
my cpu is a neural-net processor ... a learning computer . but skynet presets the switch to `` read-only '' when we are sent out alone .
does n't want you thinking too much , huh ?

no , i mean it 's growing , it 's part of us . and we cut it off . and throw it away .
is this what you want ? you ask me for this after all i 've told you ?
if i could see what you 've seen , feel what you 've felt i would n't let it end like this ! you need a like to the world out there , a connection ... then it wo n't end like this ...
you know , my dad 's done some work for kaminski ...
now you 're catchin ' on . do n't wan na get your daddy in hot water , do you ?
... she went in complaining of stomach cramps . good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart .
is that what a good doctor would do ? how old are you , please ?
okay , okay , lenore , calm down . either let me call the school or better yet , the f.b.i .
sure -- and they record your voice . and later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder . that 's out !
hi , mom . how do you feel on your fortieth anniversary ?
ancient . how do you think i feel ? put that thing down and give me a hug . andrew , stop ! ... he still does n't listen .
sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface ...
transmit a wide band co-variant signal . that 'll get his attention .
oh , is it ? buddy boy , in this business if people do n't produce , they get fired .
sloan is the hardest working person i 've ever met .
they 're all over the place ! what the hell 's going on ?
looks like we 're in the middle of the drug war .
... you know , that 's another reason you 're probably not in a successful relationship .
another reason ? ? ? did i miss something ? ? ?
you 've seen the post-its . i 've already got more juicy material than i need . why should i pay you dollar one ?
because i think you 're writing on spec and with a first person interview , you might actually sell that thing .
yeah , non-believer ? here 's yours ... `` scorpio , october to november : jupiter is in conflict with saturn , so proceed with caution ... ''
look out ! jupiter and saturn 'll get you every fucking time .
i think what mr. daniels is trying to say , jack , is --
why do n't we let mr. daniels tell us what he 's trying to say .
and that 's where you met oswald for the first time ?
yeah , strange guy . dave introduced him as ...
hey , the driver knows billy idol . wow , huh ?
yeah , hey i saw your album at musicland up at the mall .
my life is departing . i 've only one breath left .
use it to meditate . free yourself from this world as you have been taught . let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath . do not waste it ... for me .
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
my name is bobby . now i 'm not a stranger anymore . see how easy it is for us to get to know each other , beautiful ?
you had them eating out of your hand , kiddo .
they had their minds made up before i even went in there . they think i 'm a head case .
come on , dad . you could have rick drive down cunningham road and look for them .
megan , my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble .
i 'm not going anywhere , ted . you 're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
i decided to let helen run the magazine . i need to go to college , learn a few things , you know .
oh , leland , sit down and eat you dinner .
oh , i 'll sit down , but none of us are going to start eating till laura goes and washes her hands .
i 'm going to daikanyama , do you want to come walk around ?
yes , but no , i ca n't right now .
well , rose , my sleep was a little disturbed last night , and so was mrs. hillyer 's , and so was the children 's . how about you ? was your sleep disturbed , too ?
yes , mr. hillyer , it was . i ... i heard strange voices in the night .
my brother 's killed people , i know he has . truckers . if you talk him into thinking you 're not you , you 'll only get yourself dead .
he did n't `` find '' nick 's letters , did he .
just tell me when you 'll have it fixed .
-- the bad news is there 's a problem with gordon 's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night . figured you 'd know something about that , wade .
tell 'em the party is through in this state on account of you .
ah , fred -- hello ... this is hartman --
yah , sorry , so i was married to linda cooksey - ya remember linda ? she was a year behind us .
i think i remember linda , yah . she was - yah . so things did n't work out , huh ?
the phone . what did you hear on the phone . tell me . word for word .
you said hello . to frank . you wanted to talk to someone ? . don ? . and little donny . you said something about momma loves you . and something about a meadow lane . something in an hour . i do n't remember any more .
that 's fine . can i have a telephone number , area code first on where we can call you back ?
no i just ... .i do n't want to , i just want to be connected to talk to a girl .
the united nations . madmen are on the streets , paul . but i will take care of you . your cellar is well-stocked , right ?
yes , general . i am glad you came by . i overheard something that i think you should know about .
lay off , schulz . he 's got a sickness . he 's krank .
sometimes i think he is fooling us with that crazy business .
look , sergeant i know i said some things last time that i should n't have said at all but ...
i think the phrase was & quot ; sleazoid geek & quot ; .
i told you - it 's a sure thing .
but we 'll freeze - it 's below zero - we 'll catch pneumonia .
then i 'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over .
no need for bells , jack . i 'll nay enchant ye .
are you out of your mind ? i still have nightmares , my reputation 's a joke , my leg is shot -- you think i need more of that ?
it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen .
let 's go . i 'm not paying for a room , and if we do n't leave now we 'll never make it .
leave ? the honey-baby 's bringing us some cocktails .
i did . but the jury wo n't s ...
it 's not for the . they only get to convict him .
oh , i do n't want to be no bother to nobody .
oh , do n't play it small , charlie . it do n't look good on you .
strange , is n't it ? you know -- how it would have a button .
earth does n't have a patent on buttons , ted .
i want to talk to you for a minute .
not now , my dear . i 'm playing three no trump .
you think so ? you do n't think that this might not be a little dry ?
this is entertainment you 're making , toby . this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has , with this brady crisis , evolved into something much richer and more provocative .
and the idea is that the beautiful mad carlotta has come back from the dead , to take possession of elster 's wife ? ah , johnny ! come on !
i 'm not telling you what i think ! i 'm telling you what he thinks !
what 's with that laura ? yeah , sure , take a look around . there 's no one here anyway .
you 're right . there 's no one here .
you ? do n't make me laugh . you ca n't take care of shit . you 've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt . all you 're good for is games ... so far , what i got outta you is nothin ' ...
i 'm impressed with you too , jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night .
i ca n't help thinking there 's something that pendergast overlooked . if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard , it wants something that 's in here .
a blow dart . seed pods . a plant press . pretty unimpressive stuff .
i 'm only on tv because i got ta be able to hang around the casino . you understand that . you know that . come on .
your fuckin ' ass ! you could have had the food and beverage job without goin ' on television ! you wanted to go on tv .
finally someone who 's noticed ! i 'm a great admirer of yours , too , mr. nixon . you are an unusual politician . we share a mutual idol -- `` six crises '' sounds like a page from churchill .
churchill , degaulle , disraeli . they all went through the pain of losing power .
ten to one shot , you said . ten to one shot in my favor , and i lose .
get a good night 's sleep . we got a new suit , new shirt , new tie , and i 'm going to shave you myself . tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow americans .
now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i 'll break you in half .
easy , chief . i ... i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that 's all .
visit those foreclosin ' sonofaguns down at the indianola savings and loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm . hell , you ai n't no kind of man if you ai n't got land .
what about you , everett ? what 'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place ?
i love to swim , and i do n't mind the cold at all . it 's invigorating .
well , i would n't want to get too invigorated myself .
yes , that 's true , but he refused to give the nazi salute . he kept his baton in his right hand . in hitler 's presence . that was a brave act ...
brave ? to celebrate hitler 's birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute ? bravo .
i saw you sitting over here . by yourself . i thought , thank god , someone normal , who does n't know how interact at these things either .
yeah . i do n't ever know what to say .
look , i appreciate being able to talk this out , but , uh ...
this is just to satisfy my curiosity . i 'm still leaving town saturday .
i do n't think so . she 'll want larry first .
that 's probably her now . or the police .
it 's a programmed < u > mechanism < /u > , mr. spock ...
we have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in < u > precise < /u > detail . suppose that beneath its programming , the real ilia 's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision .
what 's gotten into you , sheriff ? i was --
you are the one that decided to climb into this --
yeah , i feel like ripping your fucking eyes out ...
leonard , listen . i need to see if there 's any nerve damage before we carry you back . look , i 'm trying to help you here ...
let 's get something straight , jeff -- i never asked you to leave your wife .
of course not . you had nothing to do with it .
i < u > told < /u > you .
the museum of natural history does n't send out investigators to --
a balloon and a banana ! tell me , mary clarence , what were you thinking ?
those girls were asking questions . they 've got it rough . i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age . i wish somebody would talk to me about it now .
the song . are you sincere with me , fredo ?
sincere . what are you talking about , of course i 'm sincere with you , mike .
i 'm a historian . it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious .
... your < u > scar < /u > .. ?
you look frightened . have i been saying something frightening ?
i do n't know what you 've been saying .
but there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- investigator .
are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
boing . you 're one hell of a lip reader .
why thank you . it 's a christmas present . that was my sense of humor , everyone . i wish you would fake a laugh . it 's easy with a deaf person .
you sure this is a good idea ? dobisch ca n't think of a better one .
i mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night ?
oh sure . a man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it was n't a trick .
clark kent , if you had only seen it the way i did , you -
what are you talking about ! can you transmit the code -
yes i can transmit the code emergency ! i just do n't think it 's a prudent move at this juncture .
yes , you did . you said as long as i do n't act like a fuckin ' nut , implying that i 've been acting like a fuckin ' nut .
take a pill , kid . i just meant stay cool .
i 'll get you a toe by this afternoon -- with nail polish . these fucking amateurs . they send us a toe , we 're supposed to shit our- selves with fear . jesus christ . my point is --
they 're gon na kill her , walter , and then they 're gon na kill me --
this is your bachelor party . you have n't had sex with anyone yet .
get a few drinks into me , we 'll dance and see what happens .
`` events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals ... ''
ellen , what are you trying to prove , anyway ? that we 've created ourselves a ghost ? come on !
i do n't know , but the british are excited about it , i know that . the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich .
jeez . and you think the british 'll share it with their allies ?
walk him over to bethesda fountain , buy him an ice . it 'll kill twenty minutes .
i 've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill .
oh my gosh . what 's he gon na to do ?
i really do n't know . ben miller 's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market .
you must be joking . i 've been doing all my own reading since i was forty ... you know .
hmm . i think it 's lucky i ran into you . maybe .
but i can save you -- get you to the autodoc !
no good ... it 's eaten too much of me ...
you 'd prefer that ? ... james ... you do n't really have a gun , do you .
everybody 's got a gun . in this city ...
at work there 's always this sort of film over you .
well , thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you .
yeah ... well , yours . you still do n't believe that you 're the princess , do you ?
i know i must have had something to do with the palace - i 've had little flashes of things - but being the princess ? it does n't matter as long as i find my home .
i really do apologize , mr. wayne . his project was terminated this morning ...
let me ask you something , bruce . what is man 's greatest tool ?
i do n't know -- i do n't remember .
the boy in the well . how did you know that was just a hoax ?
so you say . i 'd like to hear her side of it .
mom ! for the last fucking time , i 'm telling you laura did n't want to get married ! she is not that kind of girl ! to use a phrase . that 's not what happens now .
mookie ! how is anybody gon na call in ?
big deal ? if that 's not love , i do n't know what is .
i do n't know , mon . the food lines took forever .
food will be eaten on your time ! why are you continuously late for this class , mr. spicoli ? why do you shamelessly waste my time like this ?
if this do n't beat all ! well , i see you been busy already !
you do not see either ! -- not yet !
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night ? nighttime is my time .
you 're telling me , but only because you never let me in on any of it ... you 're not going to see bobby , are you ?
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe . i knew about it , but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business . not till now , that is .
you hired someone to open it . i 'll bet the lawyer loved that .
it 's going to go bigger than that . could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it ?
i 'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens , and it 's not gon na happen !
i was just getting ready to take a bath .
do n't take a bath . come swimmin ' with us !
i just turned i was for a whole year .
you are precious . please , call me gale .
kevin ... you 're not your dad . the two of us , we 're not your parents .
i know , vick . i 'm just not ready yet , okay ?
well , my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful , peanuthead niggas outta jail , but i do it --
look , man , i know i owe you --
go on with your dream . what was it that frightened you ?
i stood alone on the green , searching for something , and i started to walk to the church . but then the darkness closed in , i was alone in the dark , being pulled into darkness , and i fought to wake up ...
you have done well , saavik . as your sponsor at the academy i have followed your career with ... satisfaction . and as a vulcan .
sir , i speak to you as a kindred intellect . do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the federation ?
he does n't make sense to me either , chewie .
i do hope he 's all there ... if you take my meaning . i would hate to see master luke develop a short circuit ...
really ? what about hell ? they got a sign or what ?
hey , wyatt , god damn it , i 'm serious !
all right ! if you insist on being an idiot , i 'm not going to waste time coaxing you . how about you ?
oh , no - you do n't want to go yet , honey . she 'll stick around too . is that right ?
sure . you alright ? is this still that contest you 're in ...
i 'm tired . i 'm sorry , i should go . i 've been enough of a nuisance .
did anyone in your family keep in touch with her ?
not really . she was just one of those names you hear growing up . you know , so-and-so who lives in ireland . i really do n't think anyone knew about this place .
i want to rehire you . to find out what 's happening to my brother-in- law .
i 've been on another case . all day . i suppose i can move it over . seven fifty a week , plus travel expenses .
it 's still just death , the absence of life -- no honor at all . it 's worse than the blue soup by far -- that nothingness . to you , though , it 's the honor that crowns them all .
may i continue with the rearing of my son ? load that gun !
so , do you guys want to do something , go someplace or something like that ?
so , we 're all old friends of pony 's . we go way back to our childhood .
ingen is a genetics corporation , is n't it ?

why ? am i some kind of freak to you or something ?
no , no , i do n't think that , i 'm just curious about it ... do you think i 'm a freak ?
we take the licks and he gets the chicks .
how long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it 's not gon na happen ?
i 'm really lost . what does this have to do with walking ?
i said , 'i would do anything for her ' ... and she did n't believe me . i said , 'i 'd walk across the country for her ' ... she did n't believe me .
it could n't have been out at glades , if that 's what you 're thinking . i was never out there .
no , that 's not what i 'm thinking .
oh , well , i do n't wear a lot of jewelry .
all right , so you do n't like jewelry but ... eh ... you do like ... eh ... good music . liszt , one of my favorites .
is this going to be a stand-up fight , sir , on another bug-hunt ?
all we know is that there 's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved .
i got my here . that 's six shots and two refills . downstairs , i think we got another rifle , maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools . maybe a couple boxes of shells for the judge .
i got shells too , box and a half , tops .
he 's just a lonely old man . he likes to talk .
hey , i 'm a lonely old man . i like to talk , too . so why do n't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you 're working on ?

you think i 'm crazy , rosa , but you do n't know the half of it . my husband was , ahh ...

who the fuck are you , dr. joyce brothers ? i hate the son-of-a-bitch .
it 's transparent . the press 'll be all over it .
six months from now , i 'm not going to care . are you ? we 'll deal with it .
admiral , if we go by the book , like lieutenant saavik , hours could seem like days .
i read you , captain . let 's have it .
yeah . i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too .
no . but you tend to tie them up .
danny , the night we met , you said the name ilio manzetti . we were impressed . we were excited . but here it is september , and mr. manzetti is still walking around breathing the air .
we need intellectuals , we have enough thugs already .
divorce ? an alcoholic relative ? tell me , did chip torture animals when he was young ?
no , he did not ! we are a loving supportive family , mr. stubbins .
shut up ! both of you shut the hell up !
we 've got to do something . we 've got to turn around .
jeanne , what are you doing with that ... you 've got it back to front ...

stellas . i hate stellas almost as much as i hate dogs .
there might be an opening for a manager at salem next spring .
salem , massachusetts ? where all the witches were ?
we 'll see . if it does n't , what the hell , at least i gave it a shot .
that 's right . and the good thing is you can do it anywhere .
i ask only one thing ... to hear me in confession ...
i -- i ca n't jeanne ... i ca n't hear your confession ... i 'm sorry ...
and you know real cops are n't half as smart as keanu .
forget it . i 've got a scholarship to harvard hanging over my head . i wo n't risk it .
i do n't want you meeting around that house . you stay away from those kids . and away from that dog .
they seemed alright . bring a little life to that old building .
we had our agent on you . she sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a robinson's/may bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy . the white guy takes the shopping bag and they go .
this guy with melanie , that was louis gara ?
i 'll tell you what ... i think it 's all you 've got .
well ... what can i do ? you 've created a dilemma ... and , look at the that . time 's running out . i wonder ... how can i impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me ?
i think i speak correctly when i say that cameron 's love is pure . purer than say -- joey dorsey 's .
dorsey can plow whoever he wants . i 'm just in this for the cash .
all right . sure . just curious . the picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle -- or something --
well , if it 's all the same to you --
who am i ? i 'm gon na be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me . you understand ? where did you get the car !
i 'm done talking until i get a lawyer .
i saw it . clean through the palm of her hand . do you think hysteria could do that ?
it 's being doing it for centuries . she 's not unique , she 's just another victim .
if you look at hunt 's operational history , he invariably favors misdirection and deception . for a start he wo n't go into biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security .
not going in from the ground . show me the atrium .
love . it 's love parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you 've read ' ? you skimmed two chapters at miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines .
i 've been doing this a long time , tripp . i feel this kid in my bones .
guinan . it 's important that you tell me what you know . we think soran 's developed a weapon ... a terrible weapon . it might give him enough power to-
soran does n't care about power or weapons . all he cares about is getting back to the nexus .
that 's close enough . it 's a confession . the truth . jesus , i 'm sorry , laplante . i had the shoe , you said you did n't want , publicity because of your legal problems .
i do n't recall saying i did n't want a million bucks ...
let 's jump right into it . your show has sparked a world of controversy , provoked a tone of dialogue . how do you see all of this ?
yo , tavis , check it out . this is the two-one , the 21st century and it 's all about the money . like my man mase says , `` it 's all about the benjamins . ''
planet p ? what kind of name is that ?
they ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy .
gila flats -- place where jon turned into . . .
dr. manhattan , right . now if you boys care to join me , we 'll go save the world .
he 's got something to tell you , auggie .
if he 's got something to tell me , why do n't he tell it to me himself ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about -- get fucked --
i will -- i assure you that -- you got a fifty on that h-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- i 'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
it 's a beautiful home you have here mrs. rosemond .
thank you , annette . chance hill has been with my family for over sixty years . does your family do much riding ?
we ca n't even radio for help ; the carrier wave would n't reach its destination till long after we 'd died and turned to dust . we are utterly , absolutely alone . can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances ? halfway across creation ...
we came out there , we 'll go back . a long time by the clock , but a short time to us .
well , why not do it ? there 's a job for you . get a bill started to accomplish it -- present it to congress -- it would be a great experience --
senator paine , if i could do just that one thing while i 'm here , i -- i 'd feel that i --
his son is worse than he was . he 's smoother , so you do n't always hear him coming , but he 'll do anything to keep his range free .
i 'm worried what he 's going to do when he finds out you boys are back .
man , you play like a kokonut . you got to call him at least .
i know he 's got a paira kings . he do n't have to stick 'em in my ear .
katharine ! oh dear god , katharine - what are you doing here ?

no , it 's not that simple , dave ...
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust ?
it is of no concern . soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us ! your work here is finished , my friend . go out to the command ship and await my orders .
ben franklin 's going to paris , but i think the french will be long on talk and short on guns . our troops are mobs , they wo n't take orders , have no equipment ... could they beat the british ?
it comes down to leaders . if our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe ; if they go into the forests with the troops , eat what they eat , fight with them , perhaps to die ? the most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation .
what about you ? what 's your interest in this ?
well , the corporation co-financed that colony with the colonial administration , against mineral rights . we 're getting into a lot of terraforming ... 'building better worlds . '
flown ... and that 's the last you 'll see of them ?
see , yes . but we 'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them .
i 'm putting in a new illusion tonight . will you be there ?
sure . you want me to find out about quaid ? i mean , the funeral ?

i was praying this curse would have ended with me .
but it did n't . and now i need info to make things right again and you 're the only one who can give it to me .
stop talking like that , you white mouse ! nothing 's going to go wrong . as a matter of fact , today i have taken steps to insure total disaster . at two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than roger de bris .
roger de bris . roger de bris . oh yes , the director . is he good ... i mean bad ?
and you missed this ? how are you going to miss something like this ?
i did n't miss it . i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you 'd want to turn back .
youre right . i was so desperate to make everyone believe i was happy that i spent six grand on a lie . and after all that ? the only one who ended up falling for it was me .
go ahead , kat . hate me . you were running out of steam on the whole jeffrey thing . maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship .
please ... senor ... destroy me ... one bullet ... please .
maybe . we 'll have a little talk first . then ... .maybe ... i can help you out . string him up .
cook and i are almost finished here . have a seat .
stephen ... i ... can i talk to you a second ...
just a minute , robles . let him go on .
i can understand about the cat killing the first girl . charlie how come told me . all that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything . last night there was nothing to disturb it . just a little girl alone in a cemetery .
no , < i > this < /i > is your man .
with respect , sir -- it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests --
there was something . it happened up your way .
yeah , i know him -- the kid that was with him . maybe you do too . jack hewitt . he works for lariviere with me . he 's my best friend .
lois , i do n't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you 're --

whadda i got ta do , joey ? i knocked him down . what did i do wrong ? i do n't understand .
you won and was robbed ! you did n't do nothin ' wrong .
nyah , it 's very important not do anything to alarm ambrose..

oh , what bullshit ? what , do you want to fuckin ' talk it over now ?
you 're done yakkin ' , okay ? you 're done yakkin ' now ?
no -- i can see it in your eyes . i 'm a goner . it 's alright , z. in this ant 's army , a soldier 's life ai n't worth a sack of fungus . i ca n't feel my legs ...
hang in there , buddy ! you can make it ! just -- take deep breaths , i 'll try and find your body -- it 's got ta be around here somewhere !
not only is it tacky , it 's exploitation .
it 's not exploitation . these people wan na sell and i wan na buy . how are golf clubs exploitation ? she takes one night class and suddenly she 's a socialist .
well , you did n't get your prince , and there goes your diamond .
you did n't do so well yourself . finding that stone could 've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about .
look . let 's just forget about it . let 's just go to the meeting and ...
i told you , george . i 'm not going .
no , i mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you 'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart ... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be your goals ... whose dreams seem to be your dreams ?
have you ever been to bed with anyone else ?
< u > think < /u > , for christ 's sake , you guys are mired in detail , open your minds , it 's got ta be staring us in the face ! what does ethan hunt < u > want < /u > ? !
same thing he wanted in prague ! same thing he 's always wanted ! the noc list !
you sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .
that 's 'cause i 've done a lot of living .
that fella `` sport '' looks like a killer to me .
he never killed nobody . he 's a libra .
i do n't know . i 'll have to look it up .
i thought you were supposed to be an expert .
but why take the chance , when there must be other doctors ?
we have no choice . duval 's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country , and he 's right here , at hand .
do n't treat me like i 'm stupid . it pisses me off .
all right ... sorry ... i feel indebted to him .
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook ?
you always were a son-of-a-bitch , were n't you ? a little weasel with a quick , dirty mouth .
it 's the boy next door throwing at his birds . i 'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
i 'm going to wash up now . you all please excuse me .
so you 're testing < u > me < /u > now ?
oh , i think you can do it . probably .

i do n't care . load me a deck . set it up for threes and nines . i 'll cut it in on his deal .
are you so certain you are away from it ?
as far away as i ever want to be .
for the kind of money they charge here , you 'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes .
claude . here 's to your new job down at the bank . i always knew you 'd make something of yourself .
whatta you mean , whose point of view ; the audience 's point of view .
get down here . i wan na talk to you . come on ... right now ... she 's gon na talk to martin ?

black sue , fat phoebe , rosaline , burbage 's seamstress ; aphrodite , who does it behind the dog and
aye , now and again , but what of it ? i have lost my gift .
that street down there -- i always used to call it the approach road for suicides . it leads straight down to the bridge and the river .
burgel hated eduard . and me . i 'm sure he knew about us -- and i 'm sure it drove him mad .
alfred , i know you 're sick -- i can get you the best doctors .
i 've seen the best doctors -- ! a gentleman does not discuss his health . it 's not civilized . i hope i 've taught you at least that much , young man .
he did lie , and ... and ... and mother , yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook !
quiet , you little muddy-eyed brat , or ill kill you !
hey , uh , mister ? hey , okay if i grab a cue ?
hey , you 're eddie felson , are n't you ?
a vulgar pop term , but yes . take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin . that was our goal .
ask what you can do for your country . that kind of thing .
i think so ... they 're just ... so ...
i know . but let 's prep 'em . we could stay here all night ... that would n't be good --
until dallas , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race .
that 's why you bombed the building . the infected firemen , the boy --
that 's what he wanted -- a ten-year- old wife . he 'd come home from a war or a safari , and he 'd wind up talking to the little kids .
wo n't you please join our club ? please ?
i ca n't really go into it right now . i 'll just tell you it 's someone big .
some < u > one < /u > ? gim me a hint .

well , im just a little confused right now about why i work here ...
i know he 's boring but ... neuro-specialists ! that sounds pretty drastic .
it 's no use pussyfooting around , janet -- we have to cut quick and deep .
a week ago it was my business , now it 's none of my business . in other words , when you need me to take care of somethin ' for you , then you need me .
yeah , that 's right , the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams . i 'm gon na have to straighten out what you just did with this guy .
it 's cheaper than a movie , and there 's free coffee .
these are my groups . i was here first . i 've been coming for a year .
then you have never loved ? your heart is empty .
your word `` empty '' makes me laugh . is it fortunate , or unfortunate ? if it is fortunate , i congratulate myself . if it is unfortunate , i do not care , for i am not aware of it .
albert lucas trumbo . but you 've been `` luke '' since you were a baby .
ah . luke . luke . i like it .
this is n't mine . wait , where is that kid ? ...
you know it 's one thing to treat us this way , but how can you do this to your fans ? ...
another thing that baffles me , doctor - what was his connection with the deceased ? major financial dealings , obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions .
hmmm . you say he showed you his garden ?
i will not have them on my conscience . they will stay in my room .
zozo , get a key for two staff bedrooms . put these people in them .
you left her . how 's that for a fact ?
how 's this for a fact ? i loved her first .
he 's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is .
there 's got ta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown philadelphia . i take it there 's a reason we 're going to this one .
something simple . a fur coat over a nightgown ...
the point is - in the cathedral , a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends .
are you kidding ? i 'm not going to tell them .
well you have to tell them . what if something happens ? we 're actors , not astronauts ... we ca n't do this stuff !
if they 're sick , great . but let 's make sure . come on , nick .
okay . we 'll see what 's up . but if things are cool , i do n't want to hear anything more about this . life 's too short , know what i mean ?
we 're all whores , frank . you know what i 'm talking about , the way she looked at me .
she was n't looking at you , man , she was looking at me .
to conserve our oxygen , we should severely restrict our activity . anyone who can should get some sleep .
i do n't need sleep , dj . i need answers .
but first , you have to start with the clothes !
exactly . you understand that , do n't you ? you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that .
maybe we should just wait here ? hide in a tree ?
i 'm not hiding up no tree . i 'm with her . let 's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho 's butt .
my mind was not playing tricks . he was there in the storm ... gloating over his crimes ... challenging me to come .
but why risk yourself ? has n't this family suffered enough ?
you mean , < u > dis < /u > satisfied .
that 's right -- you 're a left-brain word fetishist .
skip on to the fire swamp -- that sounded good .
oh . you 're sick , i 'll humor you . so now , where were we here ? yeah , yeah , yeah . ah . oh . okay . westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor .
it was jason . i saw that goddamned movie twenty times . it was jason .
then you should know jason 's mother -- mrs. vorhees was the original killer . jason did n't show up until the sequel .
that 's nice , but we ca n't dodge this kind of heat for long .
we wo n't have to . the run is tomorrow night .
she 's not my secretary . she 's what they call an executive liaison , and i 'm not banging her , if that 's what youre implying .
not at all , dr. lester . i simply misspoke .
peter , at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue , ten people witnessed a free-roaming , vaporous , full-torso apparition . it blew books from shelves at twenty feet away . scared the socks off some poor librarian .
sure . that 's great , ray . i think you should get down there right away and check it out . let me know what happens .
... and bill . especially bill . eve did that , too .
you know , she probably means well , after all ...
please , maya . i 'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense .
if you really believe in god , why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real ?
did n't you see it ? he lifted me up and crashed me down .
hmm . . . nuclear levitation . now that 's a trick that could come in handy .
is there < u > anything < /u > we can do ? !
only one thing , sir ... get him off this planet ... his aging is part of what 's going on around us ...
what 's it say ? a hundred and two ?
i do n't believe this . i 'm calling the doctor .
... yeah . but two 's enough not to look anxious ...
yeah , but three days is kinda the money ...
it works , poppy . it works , it works !
now , icky , i do n't need you winding yourself up . i need you focused and in control .
yeah , well the only woman of the indian 's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend . i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet ... they both looked mad enough to kill him ...
yeah , too bad . they were real nice lookin ' too ... in bed together , hardly any clothes one watching tv ...
if i could find the key ... find the beginning put it together ...
and so explain it away ? but there is a way to explain it , you see . if i 'm mad ? that would explain it , would n't it ?
take the radio , stay down here in the lobby , watch the elevator .
what ? daniel , i wan na go upstairs .
christ , ai n't they all . all them retards wan na do is fuck and eat .
well , yeah ... i think that if you knew him ... i mean if you 'd understand his urges , shit the guy 's like forty or something .
that 's , uh ... that 's pretty serious stuff there .
yeah , 'cause i-i 'm , you know , i 'm , i 'm obsessed with-with , uh , with death , i think . big-
it was just the complications . i mean , you take a little thing over there and then you get complications . i mean all the guys had it .
i made you a sweater . here ... you have to take that off .
and i love the inscription you wrote to me . only i 'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am .
i hope that is n't true . we need all the downy innocents we can get .
i ... i never killed anyone before . i told you that .
well , you 're going to start with a bang , 'cause you 've got four of them to take down .
in santa ynez . and i agree with you about cab franc .

get your bag ! come on , get your bag ! get your things ! let 's go !
it 's this bullshit . it 's just bullshit right here . this is the fuckin ' problem , you know .
his family 's lived for almost a hundred years . richard does n't know how to live anywhere else . and the kids ...
the kids are grown ! they do n't need you anymore . you told me that . they hardly talk to you .
it is customary to make a little speech on the first day . it does no harm and authors like it .
you want to know what parts you are to receive . all will be settled as we go
dr. lester , would you point me toward the restroom ?
with immense pleasure , my dear . down that hall , ninth door on the left . watch the step down . it 's sunken , you know .
c'mon , talk to me ! we can do it !
he has a timer going as back-up , in case we got a hold of the remote . okay ... first , run your fingers along the edges , feel for a sensor .
then you got no excuse for living . what the hell you doin , being buddies with this creep , beni ? what 's in it for you ?
it is better to be the right hand of the devil , ... than in his path . as long as i serve him , i am immune .
they 're gon na kill her anyway . at least now with all these cops we 've got a fighting chance .
son , i have this situation under control . i know exactly what i 'm doing . you 're going to have to trust me on this .
and a month later , the sucker calls the cops and you 're on the run .
no no ! he never calls the cops , not after we give him the blow-off .
when this is over , will you get this goddam thing out of my head ?
on my life , i promise you i will .

i do n't want to place you in any position --
it was you ... that night in the tunnels . you . you did this to me .

no matter how it happened , if she goes ahead and has it '' zack , there 'll be a child in the world that 's mine -- and i could n't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived .
jesus christ , sid ! is everything your responsibility ?
and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories .
what is your problem ? you got what you wanted . cotton weary is in jail . they 're gon na gas him . a book is not gon na change that .

tom -- he 's our guest , not a prisoner .
your `` guest '' happens to be six foot five , bright red , and is government funded .
i can practically taste the water in my throat . and something else . the smell of flowers ...
then it was n't just a sign . it was a premonition ?
i mean where have you been ? nobody 's seen you around for a while .
i 've been here . i guess i have n't been out .
are you fucking nuts ? that was forty , fifty thousand . i need it . i was depending on that money .
they had a warrant . they went through everything . they would have found it . i swear .
thanks for giving me a ride . i just have a few stops , mostly on the west side --

the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it . he 's got ta cap all three of us before they even read our rights . he 's probably planning it right now .
that 's crazy . he 's not going to kill us .
so . is it true that gene simmons had a cow 's tongue grafted onto his real one ? y'know , to make it so long ?
i dunno . i think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther . i 'm not too up on gene trivia .
all i have to do is grab my suitcase , and i 'm ready . you 're lucky cause i happen to love night drivin ' .
let 's head for texas and see if we can pick up the trail .

get a grip . reed . we did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields ...
why do n't we just do his job then , so we can do our job , and get the fuck out of here .
do his job ? i 'm not a cold-blooded killer .
we gave so much to get here . i do n't know . sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for ?
because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else .
is there anything in the world that you want or need ?
i < u > want < /u > to know why you < u > need < /u > that scary guy in your house .
i -- i was wondering -- is there anything you should n't eat -- because of jungle fever ?
i could eat a raw baby crocodile . the way to get your wife back is in bed . do such a job on her that she 'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours . we 're starving . do you mind ?
well , herr inspector ! how did you find the camp ? crowded but gemuetlich , shall we say ?
i want to talk about lieutenant dunbar . is this lieutenant dunbar ?
who 's been talking to you ? the army ? have they been talking to you , huh ?
nobody 's been talking to nobody . you do n't have a case , you hear me ? it 's pure and simple . now leave me alone . okay ?
a strange collection . you 're like the false god you worship ... fallen angels , all of you .
life has betrayed us . we 've found there is no heaven on earth , so we must worship evil for evil 's own sake . we 're not wicked . we commit no violence , unless ...
this is all about fashion for you , is n't it ?
it 's the gear . chicks love the gear .

did i ever tell you , i dislocated uncle merrill 's arm ?
should we make a run for it out the back ?
then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like i was dumb or something ?
'cause adult education 's a wonderful thing . you meet a lotta interesting professors . you know , it 's stimulating .
you said do n't say nothing and i did n't .
no , you just broke his fuckin ' nose instead .
thank you for seeing us ... we ... just felt that it was time to discuss ...
what i think is going on with your son .
yes , of course , he knew , but at the time , he felt -- we both felt their existence was ... an insignificant variable .
insignificant to you maybe , but what about those people i put away with alternate futures ? my god , if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
they do n't know anything peter , they just sense . they 're hardwired !
right . hardwired to eat anything that 's not like them !
oh really - you must remember me from when i was a regular customer .

i do n't know . i was just thinking the same thing .
high-pressure nervous syndrome . muscle tremors , usually in the hands first . nausea , increased excitability , disorientation .
very good . about one person in twenty just ca n't handle it . they go buggo . they 're no way to predict who 's susceptible , so stay alert .
nothing particular the matter with him , they tell me . just -
just old age . it 's the only disease , mr. thompson , you do n't look forward to being cured of . you ought to see mr. leland . there 's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to .
what was god thinking when he built this place ?
if we do n't get out of here soon we can ask him in person .
we 're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you got ta at least look classy , if not be classy . you got ta do this thing and i do n't even know if you can .
you 're just going to have to trust me .
all right , cop . i want my money .
it 's still my money . if you want to have a chance at any part of it , shithead , you will take my $ 120,000 and bet on tomorrow 's game .

my friend , if you 're planning on crossing me ...
but real . this is gritty . like cassavetes .
exactly . why do n't you leave the guns behind this time ? go in with only batons , brass knuckles , and numb-chucks .
he 's right , theo . she might not be around to back up your story . you could end up in the middle of this .
look -- i 've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line .
what 's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates ?

i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you . i seen you over there follerin ' me .
we 're liable to win if we keep this up . for somebody like you , you sure run fast .

and things sort of just went downhill from there .
it was me . he just told me how ... i wish he could tell me now .
if he was able , what would he say .
i wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives .
a thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it . big car , slow car , chauffeur-driven car , still a car .
he was there with someone . so i suppose she must have dragged him -- that 's not fair . i 'm going back to mongi . i think dickie 's coming home . i 'm going to go home .

that sonofabitch kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow . dick , we 're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of .
nobody 's gon na beat kennedy in '64 with all the money in the world .
let 's hear from you , you goddam yankee . be nice to see you some time .

maybe he likes you , ever think of that ? it 's good for you to go out -- get your mind off mark .
i 'm sorry . that was stupid of me . i did n't mean to be so rude .
you were n't . you actually , for some reason , you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself .
i 'm trying to organize a boycott of sal 's pizza joint . ya see what i 'm saying ?
i almost had to yoke him this afternoon . tell me , tell me , radio raheem , to turn my music down . did n't even say please . who the fuck he think he is ? don corleone and shit .
but it must be done ; your government is paralyzed .
all kinds of shit would come out . like the ellsberg thing . you knew about that , henry , did n't you ?
but the lifeboat ca n't accelerate to light speed .
does n't matter -- we 're already at light speed . and when we get back to the colonies , they 'll pick us up in the network .
i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted .

lady has some deep pockets . that 's all i 'm saying .
i know how deep her pockets are , ken . i thought i might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan . guess who 's on the board of directors at the bank ?
you may be right - i sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
it 's not a habit . i do it because i like it .
how long do you live ? i mean , last ?
a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell .
there it is . better swallow it . we 're not going to have any breakfast .
need n't rub it in . what 're you eating ?
what about that tattaglias ? what will they do about bruno ?
part of the deal : bruno cancels out what they did to my father .
holy shit ! she told you about that ! buddy of mine worked there . said he watched the whole thing . they used to film people at that hotel ; nobody knew about it .
she said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm .
well , what it was ... i , i do n't want to admit it , but , you know , i was jealous of pony .
well , sure , he 's rich and he 's famous . he 's got everything and you 've got nothing .
i know you mean well , dudley , but i do n't need to do it the way you did . or my father .
at least get rid of the glasses . i ca n't think of one bureau man who wears them .
i 'm on my way to venice . why ?
venice ? i love venice . with the boats , right ? ...
yes , sir . as much as you can give me .
as much as i can give you ? ha ha . very good . i like that . come , george . let us drive . we have much to talk about .
then what brings you out on such a night ?
well , one must do something to live , you know -- and i have an elderly mother who depends on me .
listen ! do n't you hear that strange music ?
yes ! what could it be at this hour ?
yeah , that 's right . you better get us a chest-cutter before there 's trouble .
this outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded .
god , how can you stand all these assholes ?
i do n't know ... some people are okay , but mostly i feel like poisoning everybody .
we 've no proof , of course , but we rather think so , yes .
well , there you are ! charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it !
you 'd worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support .
they want this fucking job , they can have it . it 's no great joy to me .
oh man ... i do n't know . i 'm gon na miss being disreputable .
well , luther - if it makes you feel any better i 'll always think of you that way .
that 's not true , we have a great time together . i 've said i 'm sorry . let 's forget about it and go stop by my place , so i can get changed .
oh sure and you will want sex , always sex .
do i hear the sound of ... wedding bells ?
i ca n't believe you people ! no wonder she never comes to these things !
are you always this funny , or only on days when you 're wanted for murder ?
my philosophy is if you do n't have a sense of humor , you 're better off dead .
i 'm calling out . going to hit the hospital-see how caitlin is . then try to see veronica .
you wan na grab something to eat tomorrow night ... after i get out of here ?
i know that guy . his hand looks like a paw . an old black guy , the newsstand at --
no , this is young -- well , i 'm never sure how old black people are -- but , anyway , he is n't old . that 's for sure .
no , i 'm not all right . they got away . and we ca n't even follow them . they can get off the tracks anywhere they want .
which is why we 're heading to houston , texas . home of the loveless steam engine works .
have you heard anything from the girl staying with me , anne marie ?
not a damn thing . what 's going on ? mr. meyerling was here , all steamed up , looking for you .
you can trust me . is it jack ? it 's not jack , is it ? it 's *muddy* ! is it muddy ?
no . it ai n't muddy . muddy 's just ...
okay . so he 's weird . maybe on drugs . still , that 's not -
i 'm telling you . it 's not drugs . it 's something more . someth -
it 'll give you the different countries , how they came to be , what they are now , how america came to be , the governments , the languages ... everything .
many of my people will not believe those things are possible . on my planet there is only one government , one people , one language . i will be asked a lot of questions .
wait a minute , that 's going to cost you more than forty bucks .
i 'm getting angry . i want some answers . where 's the guy who runs this place ?
there 's always an excuse , is n't there ?
i think it 's time i came home now .
i do n't ... i ca n't believe it . they killed him because he wanted to change things . in our time - in our country ?
kings are killed , mr. garrison . politics is power , nothing more . but do n't believe me . do n't trust me . do your own work , your own thinking .
just , it does n't look like very much .
it 's plenty ! it 's the acorn that will grow a great oak . i 'll just find a double to finish his scenes , and we 'll release it as `` bela lugosi 's final film ''
the thing is , sir , i 've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection , with the help of dr bean here - and we feel the time 's come for whistler 's mum to have her first face-lift .
time taken its toll on the old girl , eh ?
it 's utterly fantastic ! this is the sort of thing i 'm talking about ! we should be learning this !
why ? god alone knows what it means . until it has proven value , it 's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick . hardly fit for the classroom .
-- all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt .
bullshit . marty 's plan is only about efficiency . i 've got two cousins on the job , you think i 'd work for him if i did n't believe in it ?
it 's people with no lives watching other people 's fake lives .
yeah , i guess there 's nothing like watching those tenpins fall , huh , del ?
you must return here with a shrubbery or else ... you shall not pass through this wood alive !
thanks you , knights who say ni ! you are fair and just . we will return with a shrubbery .
gee , sir , that last remark does n't exactly make all the sense in the world .
major , you 're talking like one of them !
the crown is that of scotland . and scotland is william wallace .
that is another matter . there is a price to all this , required both by longshanks and our nobles . pay it , and you will be our king . and we will have peace .
you thought i 'd help out on specifics ? i 'll confirm what you get , try to keep you on the right track , but that 's all . are you guys really working ? how much ?
i do n't know maybe sixteen , eighteen hours a day -- we 've got sources at justice , the fbi , but it 's still drying up .
you went into the cells -- - and you changed them . how ... ? !
there was no thought . there was no act . that is not what i am .
hey -- joe ! where you going ? we 've got to celebrate tonight !
no -- i -- i 'll take a walk --
well , i thought that ... well , the way it always works is that sga president does a count , then the sga advisor , you know , for the two independent counts .
fine . so do your count . start with president , and i 'll be right back .
honey what a pleasant surprise , sorry to keep you waiting .
josh , i have to speak you , it 's urgent .
you mean there 's something you have n't asked me ?
you 've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped sid and you 've got his module . you 're free to go  right now . why are you going to do this ?
it 's not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone . i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of .
you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
that should be enough . can you enclose it to hold water ?
i suppose i can , sir ; are you planning to take a swim ?
she 's off with jimmy , that 's her boyfriend .
that 's lonely for you , i guess . i always think of motel rooms as lonely .
why do you even need a ride ? you could walk there in two minutes .
it 's just an excuse for us to spend time with you .
not as well as i 'd like . we 're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient . i 've had supply problems of every kind and ... what 's so funny ?
nothing . i never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer i knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... but you wear it well .
those kids seem to be getting along fine ! --
it must be the sea air -- it gets everybody .
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan ?
will and deanna joining the titan . dr. crusher going to starfleet medical ...
shit . sarah darling . i interviewed her too . god , it 's happening again is n't it detective ?
yes well we have a suspect , so do n't get that worried .
yes , sir . the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal , malicious mischief and scientific heresy .
be it so ordered . the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question . this hearing is adjourned .
i know what < u > that 's < /u > like . anyway , i brought a copy of the script . you would play the `` ghoul 's wife . ''
the < u > ghoul 's wife < /u > ? ! god , i ca n't believe i 'm doing this ...
nice piece of work , fox . why do n't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room ?
i 'd love to , mr. lynch , thank you .
money . how they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs , that i do n't know .
i 'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to hollis and who is involved .
ai n't that the sweetest thing . what am i supposed to do about supper with you traipsin ' around with that fag ?
you 're not crippled . get in there and make somethin ' .
that is my daughter . she say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon . i am sorry , mr. jimmy . i will make it short .
i 'll be out this afternoon , remember ? your family can visit as long as they like .
it 's more like 40-60 , would n't you say ?
we agreed that if i took care of the business ; i 'd be entitled to the extra . is n't that what we agreed ?
just relax . you 're at school now . no one can get you here .
but if it was n't billy it could be anybody . he could be here at school right now .
this book is n't arranged that way . what do you want to know ?
there are a thousand things ... why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch ? is this a punishment ? are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell ? and how long is this going to < u > last < /u > ?
you got a punk-ass mouth on you , kid .
my name 's not kid . it 's client . as in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle . now , you got something for me or not ?
i 'm not huggin ' you in the middle of the street . you must be crazy , julius .
whoa , hold up li'l sis ' . i done told you 'bout that . julius ai n't my name , you better recognize hopkins was our slave name . my true name is ...
that 's good . now , seven more like that while i make fuses .
i was thinking , there 's so much i 've got to show you when we get through this . it 's mind boggling , the pos- sibilities ... disneyland , the beach , movies ... matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs ...
captain picard agrees that the b-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself . if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix , he should have all my abilities .
he 'd have all your memories too . you feel comfortable with that ?
simon 's home . i was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he 's had a chance to think and adjust ...
it 's been five weeks ... another few wo n't kill me .
are you kidding ? you buy enough gourmet junk every week ... most of which < u > rots < /u > ... to garage a fleet of stretch limos .
i had the dream again . and i got another call . this time he spoke . he said `` you and me , you and me . ''
your father-in-law packs a wallop , for an old guy . he and his wife gone back to chicago ?
no ... squatting out there at the holiday inn like a couple of vultures . he really thinks rachel 's going to go back with them . her and ellie .
i thought it was important for you to know the facts .
and so should you . sketchy told me i could expect a visit from you . i know all about how you threatened him . that if he did n't break it off with me , you 'd save him the trouble .
that 's all right -- our men can ride your horses .
not a bad idea . if our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change . now , i do n't mind letting you have our horses , but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers .
cupid stupid ! that 's the last time i am getting any more fruit off you tom . call that fresh ? there was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit . you should open a butcher 's , not a grocer 's .
if you will order stuff that comes from kat-man-fucking-du do n't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route . ~ never mind that , what about the money ?
... not what i expected when we walked through that door .
no . but it 's somewhere without big worms .
hi . i could give you a ride if you need .
no , that 's okay . thanks , though .
gov , want to leave me that one . how come he got to play with this one , anyway .
i left them here . i was doing some work here .
look at this . the lock is totally demolished .
i guess someone lost their key . you did get your tetanus shots , i hope ?
you ca n't take a guess for another two hours ?
no , i mean we ca n't < u > land < /u > for another two hours . fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains . we 've got to go through to chicago !
well , thanks again . this was really nice of you .
it was the least we could do . and i love to cook .
i 'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here ... .a weekly thing .
hmm , i see possibilities but you got a lot to do .

yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . that was ...
that was good . you were holding the evidence .
alright , roper . you want to come ... come .
good . i wo n't be armed . we got ta operate on trust here . we 're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible .
you should . a lot of comics play vegas .
well , i 'm afraid it 's not that easy ...
he 's got ta be in the forest . all three ranches run alongside it .
think we should get up a search party , head in there ?
they feel you 've been sort of left out of things , terry . they think it 's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks .
a steady job and a few bucks extra , that 's all i wanted .
sulu 's giving us his position and telling us he 's standing by ...
he 's placing himself in a most awkward position ...
it 's not falling asleep . you 've only been standing there for three minutes .
i 'm the one who can feel my leg , and it 's falling asleep .
what ? why the hell did he do that ?
he was trying to get into my apartment and ... i know this sounds gross but i was so turned on . i grabbed him and kissed him !
all i know is -- it 's not brooke .
that 's touching , elle , but we need an alibi .
shit , i forgot to call her back . she 's off on a trip somewhere . oh god , my grandad 's flat in london 's been sold .
in cheyene walk ? lucy 's going to have a meltdown . oh , i 'm so sorry .
so . you 're a soldier . fighting for whom ?
with the one thirty second under perry , from '21 to '27 --
uh ... ... how long have you been thinking about this , walter ?
oh ... f-for a long time . ever since you first came to the club .
john never said much about him . he dies . even before the war ...
stop ! i do n't want to know . hold still . so ... it was john that ordered you here ?
i was just bored . i only think school is awesome like , % of the time .
plus , you 're the only person who does n't stare at my stomach all the fucking time . you actually look at my face . and every time i look at you , the baby starts kicking me super hard .
no -- wait -- the moon 's falling out of orbit -- that 's not possible !
well , considering it is , in fact , happening , i would assume it 's possible . the retrograde orbit began in when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
an energy reading from 'c '' deck -- from inside mr. spock 's quarters ...
mr. chekov , i ordered spock 's quarters sealed !
it has bones . be sure to swallow one .
although knowing you as i do -- there will be no settlement . this time it will be complete and total annihilation .
< u > what 's < /u > your point .
well , i need to find out as much about daniel as possible .
tucker , you know where the money is -- i want it .
qualen , go fuck yourself . the game 's over -- you lost .
so you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good .
yeah , but he insisted on us bringing him to the station .
ted ! what are you doing ? you ca n't fly this plane !
that 's what i 've been trying to tell these people .
or do you have a taste for the good life , ted ? it 's in your blood .
i always knew there was more . i felt it .
maybe you did n't hear what i said . i will not tolerate this infighting among the staff , i warn you that ...
boss , then i 'm afraid i ca n't continue working with bill .
commander , as i was saying ... in `` the quasar dilemma '' , you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override . but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix , so we were wondering where the error lies ?
it 's a television show . okay ? that 's all . it 's just a bunch of fake sets , and wooden props , do you understand ?
nothing . why , do you think i should ?
you tricked me - i would n't have - i 've never - never
not much . he 's an uncle of mine , i think . i never saw him , but my mother 's name was semple , you know .

all anybody saw was clint eastwood drinkin ' coffee .
can you develop an ulcer in two minutes ? being cool is hard on your body .
we got the sphere but the commander 's down there with a bunch of cannibals ! teb , reset the pod , we 're going back .
that thing 's not going to get us down there fast enough . face it , he 's dead .
you want me to get out of my own fuckin ' town ? !

i want to meet her one day , please tell her the great news . i 'm out like vanilla ice .
i like it . can i be your friend ?
stay away from my thang . sorry , honey . 'thing . '
the users ... you really think they 're still there ?
they 'd better be ... i do n't want to bust outta this dump an ' find nothin ' but a lot of cold circuits waitin ' for me .
are you kidding ? his hair 's probably the most nutritious thing in here . see , you 've reduced me to eating weeds .
... my friend does n't like it here either .
mr. wayne ... a reminder : tonight is that loathsome party , hosted by that odious mr. shreck . may we rsvp in the resoundingly negative ?
i 'm tempted , but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration , and ... umm ... selina will probably be there ...
how 's that ? can you hear me better now ?
yes , mr. zorg , i hear you perfectly ! so , how was the concert ?
and , father , i 've never been guilty of any institutional infractions , have i ?
you certainly have not , you 've been very helpful , and you 've shown a genuine desire to reform .

yeah , i know what i said ! but -- trust me , it 's not gon na happen !
yes murdered ! you said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too . i do n't know ... maybe mom 's nuts !
it 's a cool idea , misty ! let 's make a gore movie about mom ! better yet , a tv series !
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly , causing reverberations --
that 's bullshit and you know it ! you built this fucking ship and all i 've heard from you is bullshit !
so what was all this -- some sort of test ?
congratulations , you 've penetrated a bastion of male privilege . i guessed you were n't a stickler for tradition , doctor .
that 's going to be tough . you know how these guys are about their chains of command ...
any problems , you remind them those chains of commands end at one place . me .
mr. spicoli , you 're on dangerous ground here . you 're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time .
i 've been thinking about this , mr. hand . if i 'm here ... and you 're here ... does n't that make it our time ?
i 'm glad somebody finally cried . every time i come in here and see all this unnecessary death , i want to cry . i do n't cry , of course . not manly , you know . did she try antihistamines ?
they made her so sleepy she could n't work .
this is a mistake . i should n't be here .
i want you to meet me here right after class , okay ?
a new outfit bought the red car . some big company called cloverleaf industries .
no kiddin ' ? bought the red cars , huh ?
[ then what do you have to lose ? ]
[ it 's a moral issue . on one hand you 're cleaning up the bad guys , but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys . ]
i want to see my mother . where is she ... ?
in the coffin , my dear . where else ... ?
mrs. robinson , it makes me sick that i said that to you .
we 'll forget it right now . finish your drink .

every last bit of it . the big guy 's room was empty .
clarice ... you 're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying .
i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore - or starting to . tell me the rest now .
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like ?

ricky , who knows how long we 're gon na have to be here . we got ta make it last .
fine . i 'll put it on my room . okay ?
i 'm sorry . i forgot about calling for you .
it 's quite unimportant , mr. mitchell . after all , you got what you wanted .
soggy bottom boys - i do n't precisely recollect , uh -
they cut a record in here , few days ago , old-timey harmony thing with a guitar accump-accump-uh-
well , either we 're gon na hit the hay or get married . now you do n't want to hit the hay , and i don ' want to get married .
you have some very primitive ideas , do n't you ?

police . they have their head in their asshole and they still ca n't find shit .
-- < u > whoever < /u > -- they built an entire house < u > around < /u > a < u > tree < /u > . sticking up right through the living room . somebody like to explain that to me ?
the rest of the family was crazy as rusty parr .
you want to take her to my place and get cleaned up ? you come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes , `` oh , i had you all wrong '' ?

`` seymour butts . '' i never get tired of that one .
that 's why it 's a classic . come on , man ... how 'bout a hug ... ?
if you do get out of your marriage , will you continue to be inhibited ?

he made friends with a family called columbier , and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter , caroline .
it will scarcely be considered credible , perhaps , but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together .
i 've seen guys like you go under before . guys that never had a worry . then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy . the first thing that happens to a guy
hey , did yuh get a load of the bedroom ?
to you ! you just made a 'yummy ' sound , so i thought you liked the dessert .
i did n't make a 'yummy ' sound -- i just asked what it was .
the name van tassel is blackened . you share that name .
call me a liar , then , and a murderess . say it , out and out .
this guy 's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks , ever since he got outta jail , wreaking general havoc , contributing to the bad name of the place . the term `` menace to society '' was made up for him .
he 's crazy . he ca n't help it .
but you 're dog enough . maybe they 'll let you sleep outside the box near your master .
big deal paper hanger ! hell , anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks . like breakin ' open a piggy bank .
scientists . i 'm supposed to report in to them . they 'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time .
so you could talk to these scientists and they do what ? send you to the future ?
dad , you have to talk to coach for me .
and what am i supposed to say to the man ?
sadist ! i ca n't believe i thought you could change -- this is your idea of discipline ? you 're a monster . that kid is going to be traumatized for ...
about three days . i 'm a monster . he 's a monster . actually , we 're both just guys . i do n't expect you to understand that i ...
it 's cash . and a second passport . if anything goes wrong when we 're inside , if you sense even the slightest deviation do n't look over your shoulder , you walk away - you hear me ? just walk away .
you do n't think we 're going to make it .
hey , he 'll be all right . believe me lana , i know . i was a late bloomer myself .
it is n't only that he 's small for his age . how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father ? look at him , he 's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon .
i need a partner , roy . i need an inside man , and you 're it . you could be as wonderful as cole .
i do n't know , myra , i never had partners . i never needed them .
how come you did n't let him shoot me ?
like i said , i 'd still be up on that mountain , frozen solid , it was n't for you .
i 'm staying right here . doing my job . fighting to get my show on the air . you do n't like it ? hey , i 'll tell you what ... fire my ass ...
end up in a high-profile lawsuit with lowell , the first amendment martyr ? i do n't think so . take a look at this ... this is a summary of a dossier that 's being prepared .
micheal , now is probably not the best time for this .
no , this is the perfect time . this is real time . adam . your brother and i , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you ... ... are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy butt-fucker .
okeh , i was wrong . but you ca n't expect a fellow who never saw lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin ' . you 've been sorta close mouthed about him .
i guess i have . you were pretty little when they locked him up . i do n't suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months .
oh , nothing , wade . how ya doin ' there ?
stan grossman looked at your proposal . says it 's pretty sweet .
so , what 's < u > your < /u > name ? it 'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway .
jack foley . you 've probably heard of me .
yes , but it 's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .
anyway , it 's just as well that we replace it . better safe than sorry .
joanna , whatever it is , believe me , i 'm sorry .
here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning . they 'll be ready on saturday .
and here is three tree mesa -- and here i go out of the big arroyo --
that 's the place : i remember - my feet were so darn sore , i could n't make it -- and galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
you ca n't expect me to explain that to you .
what matters to me is whether you understand it .
what about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in gotham ?
if there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- i would have seen to it they were shredded .
he says okay , it 's all right catherine comes here .
oh , marty , thanks a lot . that really takes a load offa my mind .
i really should go . i really need to catch my ride .
i did n't want to go . i was too nervous . i thought , maybe you were a nut . but you were exciting . you called from upstairs .
okay , look , i 'm delivering this to a man who 's going to give us the key to our job . but it 's pointless to try to explain it yet . you just have to trust me . i do n't have any more secrets .
everyone has secrets , it 's what makes us human .
oh , right . the guy flipped out or something ? killed some people , then put a gun to his own head ?
they found him dead in his own cab down by the port authority .
you 've got some huevos bringing this ... thing ... into my rig ! with everything that 's been going on up in the world , you bring a nuclear weapon in here ? does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic , or is it just me ?
you do n't need to know the details of this mission ... you 're better off if you do n't .
you ca n't switch 'round jobs , anyway . i figured he knew that .
you ca n't expect him to learn everything the first day . hopefully it 's taught him a very valuable lesson .
that 's frances . i 'm not the cookbook .
you see : we 've got to change that name .
i remember you turned around . your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- i could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between naomi and me .
i did . you said , things were fine .
the dixie cups ? oh my . i was just a girl . of course . spring is here the sun will shine
hold it . mary patrick , you 're a pretty cheerful person , are n't you ?
son , lots of people tell me i 'm a gifted man , but i still ca n't see around corners .
just exactly what are you so hot about ? i mean , i know it 's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds , but --
what goofy idea have you got now ? do n't tell me you suspect judge ramsey of stealing the body .
i 'm going to make you eat dirt , you soap bubble ! i 'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go !
taking genesis ? who ? who is taking genesis ?
... see you but ca n't hear . did you ... order ... ?
of people like you . people i was just trying to help . they could n't get worse so i thought , with medication , they might get ...
medication ? what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer ?
if he wo n't listen to you , who will he listen to ?
he wo n't listen to anybody . he 's been very crazy all summer . since june he 's been trying to kill me .
you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me .
i respect you . you 're a bold fighter , maybe not the brightest , but ... han no , your worship.. that 's not what i 'm talking about .
i said we 'd see . and as it is , i was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids . ' when you 've saved it up again , i 'll let you go .
you used my savings ! you stole my savings . if my father were here ...
yeah ... like  stupid , ridiculous , crummy art .
ohhh . that 's new . that sounds good .
it is n't safe , man . do n't go splittin ' us up . not with this one .
-- what the hell 's the matter with you ? you always check the other side . i have n't got time for bullshit right now , okay ? we got a job here .
here ... here we are ... here you are and here i am ... feel it ?
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points . must you flirt ?
i keep thinking i should call the radio and tv stations ...
if you do they 'll be seeing him everywhere , on every street corner , in every house . just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes .
he did n't hurt you or anything , did he ?
you mean , did he try to jump me ? no , but he was kind of talkative .
you sure ? what about before he turned up with the boy ?
... no . in fact , id seen him a couple of months earlier . he was quite depressed . his work wasnt getting anywhere . he said he was going to try something new , realism , london in the nineties - documentary stuff , you know ...
honey that song came out in , when i was exactly your age .
unbelievable ! trent told me he wrote it . he 's history .
you do n't act like the rest of gideon 's friends . they believe if you are not hard at work , you are hard at sin .
oh , i 'm more modern in my ways . i do n't believe in sin , though there is good and evil . and evil is a thing you work at .
are n't you a sweetheart ... no , not quite . anyway , she 's been with us awhile .
but she wanted more out of life , right ?
would you like a dessert ... i 'm having one .
no thanks . i 'd like to break away --
do you have the musical , `` annie '' ?
sure do . did you bring back `` ghost dad '' ?
i want you to leave with us . right now .
i ca n't leave . we have to tell this to the president .
come on , spock . why did n't you jump in ?
i was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words .
we 're going to leave that up to detective williams . i 'll tell you though , you 're okay . you shot a real son of a bitch .
yeah . i sure know that . yeah , but how many more are out there ?
what law , merk ? having fun ? letting down our hair on prom night ?
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .
she only works when i 'm on . i make her wait and it drives her crazy .
is it true that you and love went on a blind date ? she hit you with a bottle ?
no snacking between meals ! off you go ! now -- what were we saying ?
i do not recollect , your majesty . will that be all ?
well , the sofa is n't often used for sleeping on ...
oh yeah ? on your own a lot , huh ?
that 's because there 's a lot of bad people out there . hey , puffy tried to warn you about that steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself , did n't you ?
okay , you win . now try to get some sleep , huh .
no , that 's not what i 'm saying . i 'm saying i do n't need a limousine to know who i am , alright ?
right on . you know what ? he does n't need the limo , man .
you professional men drive a hard bargain . i 'm afraid i only have five on me . sheila pulls out a dollar bill .
if you want a professional man , you have to be willing to pay for him .
why ? you 're a wudan fighter . training is everything .
during my meditation training ... i came to a place of deep silence ... i was surrounded by light ... time and space disappeared . i had come to a place my master had never told me about .
`` under the bleachers '' ... by seymour butts .
pardon me ? i 'm afraid i do n't ...
poor baby . she do n't know what she missed . what color hair she have ?
sorta brown , blonde , i guess . but dig this , sweetie . then she turns over , peels off them orange pants , and spreads her legs real wide and says to me ...
you see anybody else here ? just between you and me .
during the landing ... when things were at their worst ... owens was at his best . he 's the one who would n't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin .
hello ? city ? cops ? it 's a fucking conspiracy !
pardon my glibness trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic . the next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type . you 're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse .
ca n't you tell when somebody 's hittin ' on you ?
so what if he was ? it 's all your years of waitin ' tables has made you jaded , that 's all .
what 's that little 'droid ' carrying that 's so blasted important ?
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system ... our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness , which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo .
what a load of crap . hell , a week ago i had n't even heard the word parabnormal --
`` paranormal '' but -- you read the transmission .
i think you must go now -- the key is on the floor .
i 'm not going -- you know i 'm not going -- let me stay here ?
well then -- i beg you -- i beseech you --
but then i would n't have the fun of having you come here and beg again , toddy .
do n't tell al . he does n't know .
well , he 's the only one in america who does n't !
dorothy , please ! we 're trying to count ! fifty-eight --
oh , but aunt em , she hit him over the --
not exactly , but i want to be one , like you .
i admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly .
it was her boss ' idea not to report it to the police ?
no . the man whose money she ... he talked so loud and fast , and i ... i should 've called the police .
all that is comes through the eye of the artist ...
alright get a grip on yourself now since you 're here why do n't you start early , the kitchen needs cleaning .
hang on . hang on , max . you see ?
i see . i see the earth opening up and swallowing us all .
what are you trying to say ? just because i dress well and like to dance --
what ? no . i 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms .
i do n't know how many times i have to say this , elaine , but viktor and i are not in love . i only make love to the camera .
simone , i recognize the shirt you 're wearing . i gave it to viktor on his birthday .
now what do i have to do to be left in peace ?
i think all you have to do , giulia , is to close the door .
with a little checking , i could get to believe you .
i do n't care if you do or ... i want to see mary ... before she gets in any deeper ...
it 's a long shot , but ... billy used to tend bar here a few years back . i heard him talk about it .
this part of town , they 'll make us for heat the second we walk in . just back me up like you 've got a piece ...
he saw the truth , and < u > spoke < /u > it ...
i 'm afraid , this wine is making me woozy ...
i understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits , doctor .
they are fremen suits . i hope they fit well , my lord .
a great artist will have great privileges in a russian zone .
that 's why he did n't get the hell out of here when he had the chance ! i put that to him , he could n't answer . why did n't he go and direct in america , like that italian , toscanini .
i know your intentions . i probably know much more about you than you realize . in many ways you 're a lot like your father . he was an indulgent man , but a clever warrior . now what brings you out here ?
my father told me many stories about you . he said if i was ever in trouble , to come here ... i need your help .
billy 's right . whenever he touches me , i just ca n't relax .
you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother 's untimely death . it 's no big deal . you 'll thaw out .
lecter is still the key , i know he is . whatever he told me about bill is just as good now as it was before .
or just as worthless . but i want you in memphis , close to him . maybe when he gets tired of toying with senator martin , he 'll talk to you again . there 's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip .
when you say , i can be somebody else , what do you mean exactly ?
exactly that . we can put you inside someone else 's body for fifteen minutes .
no you do n't , and you know it .
if our positions were reversed , would you leave me ?
i do n't know how to thank you . mother 'll be so grateful - she 'll probably want to kiss you .
your mother will want to kiss me ? give me back my letters . that 's the breaks i get . it 's the mothers that are always grateful to me . here .
detroit . snoopy miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash .
ever seen an uncut diamond , studs ? they look like plain old rocks .
a couple of hours ? why are you going up there in the first place ?
they said they wanted to know about this stuff . they said to keep them updated , so i did !
no , no , no ... i love my husband .
oh , sure . i can just feature you standin ' outside your little hutch , holdin ' a carrot cake waitin ' for hubby to come home .
we should charge ! does n't anyone have a job to do ?
they have to clear all the local roads of mines . that 's a big job . they wo n't stay in the house . they 're putting up their tent in the garden .
i taught him to drink beer . he taught me how to fly .
he said you 're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him .
what is all this `` nick '' stuff -- nick would you like a cigarette . nick can you give me a ride .
she did n't ask me for the ride . she asked anybody .
i think we may have found our mexican drug czar . it 's this general , salazar . at least i 'll have somebody on the other side i can talk to .
does this mean you 're going to be gone more ?
of course he is . freddy 's dead and gone .
and how about your co-star in nightmare i. would you trust him alone with your child ?
it 's still not going to work ! they 'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel !
who said i 'll re-enter in the pod ? i got friends out in space , ryan , friends willing to get me back unnoticed . thank god for deregulation huh ?
not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia .
he 'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid .
you were rich before . this is the first time i was ever rich .
go home ! show them how rich you are for a change !
i 'll meet you , marietta , if that 's what you want , but i 'm against it .
seven tomorrow evenin ' . we can eat at galatoire 's . fix it .
my life 's an open book . you read ?
i 'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic .
i ca n't believe you just rolled a joint in here .
hey , man , what happened with that old guy ?
a normal human being could n't live under the same roof with her , without going nuts . she 's my idea of nothing !
i asked you a question . do you love her ?
all these parties are so marvellously < u > alike < /u > .
they should be ... but there 's something funny about that soldier .
you know nothing about feelings , natural or unnatural .
then without feeling , your guests were also wondering whether the music could n't be a shade more on the - shall we say , happier side ?
across ninth avenue . dodgie 's . where you 've been getting your hair cut for fifty years . where uncle billy and uncle marty got their hair cut . where jim rorty shot a man for cheating at poker .
it was rummy , not poker . but i 'll take a chance and let you in .
did n't you hear me , grandpa ? or you got your hearing aid turned down ?
i heard you . but i 'm choosing to ignore you . epps , let 's go .
come on , let 's go have that drink .
what the fuck did i do wrong ? ! tell me !
bianca , i do n't think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding .
sometimes i wonder if the guys we 're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with , you know ?
and they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world . you know why ? all they eat is seafood .
also , never underestimate the restorative powers of `` karaoke . ''
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy . pit of your stomach . like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you 're head over heels ... . ?
well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken , m'boy , but i believe it 's that sort of love . sounds nice to me .
good for you , miss winch . you now have exactly seconds to get this rust bucket out of here .
i know my rights . these are international waters . the british navy abandoned that boat , and i 'm claiming it . under international law , i have the right to salvage what 's on that wreck .
you had better bring a few bottles home with you , my friend ; you 'll need help sleeping tonight .
this one could seduce the devil . a body ! and eyes as big and black as olives .
this is n't gon na get you laid , you know .
yeah , we 'll just see about that , wo n't we ?
i had n't thought about it . understand me , gregor -- i take no pleasure in killing . it does n't bother me one bit , but i do n't get off on it .
a means to an end , is that it ?
jogging . i was running , now i 'm jogging .
that 's what you were talking about yesterday ? everybody does that in the future ?
but you did n't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the warren commission .
that 's what bothers me , mr. garrison . you see , they 've been altered . my statements ...
and now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you ... ? !
no , my love . i want nothing more of the dead . i want you to -- - chang me .
i do n't ... what , someone on base ? a `` mole '' ?
this is what you get for brain- picking an old cia spook . but if i needed to control the outcome of this test case , that 's how i 'd do it . a man-in-place . makes everything very controllable .
we 're not going next door until we 've flayed these dead men walking . count it out the back . i do n't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in .
but ... give it us here , you dozy sod . you hide and get the guns ready . wait until they are well in , then give it to 'em .
ben , think about all the people we can help if this works --
maybe you should think about yourself for once . you always let this guy push you round --
thanks . but i 'd like to hear what you 're feeling ...
well , i just feel that life 'll be much sweeter for you now with me around . i promise ...
we had to take shelter in the checkpoint . jesus , wes , i killed the iraqis in there .
you actually got around to killing someone . i 'm impressed . i guess you 're only half a bitch .
who 's she gon na tell , anyway ? she only hangs out with dead people .
not her . me . they 're beautiful , are n't they ? the stars . i never just look anymore and they 're beautiful .
i 'd really like it if you would come round some time - then i could cook you a meal - what do you say ...
yes , that would be nice - i 'll call round some time ...
i just admire your maturity , that 's all . i mean , there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring . day after day , year after year ...
... see , that 's what i thought at first . how can you like someone that perfect ? no potential for long-range livability .
of course not , no . is that why you 're here ?
i think we need to talk about some things .
we 'll hop a plane tonight . an island ceremony . an abba dabba honeymoon !
it looks so ... < u > new < /u > .
good , yeah , it is a rose . only this one is rather atypically made from % pinot noir .
pinot noir ? not again ! you know , not all pinots are noir .
it probably has the dumper 's name . it might give us some kind of new lead . i want a look at it anyhow .
klute , the company 's interest is tom grunemann . solely and exclusively . you say you ca n't find tom ; all right , i 'll see that you 're paid off ; the case is closed .
how 's it going to look on your report ?
it 'll look like justice . that 's what that fat fuck got . < u > justice < /u > .
you feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins ? honey , you 're not on your death bed , yet ... .this kinda talk 's gon na get you in trouble --
-- - do n't . do n't . please . just ... listen to me ... honey ... . ... i 've done ... i 've cheated on you .
we got about two more hours of day light left . that 'll get us into el paso , which is right next to the border . we 'll stop at a motel --
stop ? we 're not going to actually stop at a motel , are we ?
but what 's our relationship ? are we good friends , or is she just a casual acquaintance ?
dolores , i got five days to shoot this movie . quit kidding around .
it 's all right -- you 're my guest .
... i 've never been in a man 's apartment before .
you 'd be taking away his freedom , nathan .
freedom 's just another word for nothing left to lose , lila , to quote janet jackson .
this may be a very good inn for germany , but it would not pass in old ireland . corbach is only a league off , let us push on for corbach .
do you want to see the loveliest woman in europe ?
do n't take that . tell him to shut the fuck up .
i ca n't do that . he 's the man . he 'll fire my ass .
you know who that is , do n't you ? you really do n't ? that 's skip skipperton , man . he gets himself hit by a truck , this whole town shuts down .
oh , so that 's him ? the panda man .
she 's not property , john , she 's a person . were you just going to keep right on lying to her ?
what the hell do you think ? i love ann . you think i 'm going to tell her about cynthia and hurt her feelings like that ?
and you 've been roaming the streets while your mother is god-knows-where ?
i was going to a funny movie , but i changed my mind . if you 're depressed , laughing does n't help much . when did you know my father ?
rick . let me tell you . wait , we 're in the ...
shut the fuck up . ricky . you have a mean streak in you ... and what the fuck are you babbling about ... ?
thank you . and thank you for the flowers .
i wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of long island is fogged in .
maybe you can ask him to loan you the money .
yoooo , that 's it . you ai n't as dumb as i think you are , roach .
but when your sunflowers come up , i 'll pay you for them .
i planted a row just for you and you do n't owe me anything .
alright donald , alright , but just let him talk . i want to hear all viewpoints . i truly do . i truly am .
do n't you see the danger , john , inherent in what you 're doing here ? genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet . but you wield it like a kid who 's found his dad 's gun .
ok. come back this afternoon , about four o'clock . if you give me the number of the case , i 'll have the dossier here waiting . my tailor , ... well worth the investment .
i 've got numbers all over these - i 'm not sure which is the one you want .
but sooner or later we 've got to end this relationship . and it 's better to do it right now .
i have no desire to sacrifice myself ... it 's idiotic to sacrifice oneself ... why ? ... for whom ? if anna were here i might understand your scruples . but she 's not ...
tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
i guess ... some of them are probably faking .
god , sometimes i think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a cd player ...
the way you talk . never heard a woman talk like that .
oh look , i have n't got time to be proper , i want to live . i 'm a woman , i like men . if that 's unladylike then i guess i 'm not a lady . at least i 'm honest .
i mean -- on account of that policeman last night . you think he 's a bank robber , maybe ? or a gangster ?
no , dear , of course not . he 's a very nice man . i just think he might prefer to be left alone . now you get to bed and forget about it . 'night , darling .
we can send in a plant -- try to get pollux to spill the location .
he 'd see that a mile away . the only person he 'd talk to about that bomb is his brother . unfortunately , turnips ca n't talk .
do you want your buttons on the left or the right ?
the left . it 's more natural . hey , i 've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb . what would that be made of ?
that 's what winston does . he finds people who do n't want to be found .
well , bully for that nigga . you say she wants to give me the money , huh ?
... we got ta get outta here -- now .
shut up , man , just shut the hell up ! i got ta think ! i got ta think ! !
the university can not do this . is the room safe ?
yes , i think so , it is still barred , but it is not the university who are in the building .
hello ? is this me ? i 'm trip . am i on the air ?
i should hang up on you right now , but you 're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk . what are the names of the four members of kiss ?
pop , i 'm gon na go with mookie .
good , make sure he do n't jerk around .
mrs. eleanor biddlecombe . she also owns % of the profits .
mrs. virginia resnick . she also owns % of the profits .
it 's okay , mister . no big deal .
yes it is . it 's a law of the universe . if i let you walk away , the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years .
any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers ?
no , sir . they all been real straight with me .
-- but you enjoy being the stronger one ? you like the control .
if you 're asking me if i 'm passionate about what i do , the answer is yes . without passion , nothing moves us . what 's your passion ?
not always . but i want you to know i 'm very grateful for what you did for me .
i did n't do anything . it just happened .
i did n't want to leave without saying how much i admire your jewelry .
hey , smart ass , how 'bout i kick your butt ?
excuse me , steve . i said namely you should n't go around wild , blaming people without justification .
i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated .
i do n't mention that anna 's a vegetarian , did i ?
i have some parsnip stew from last week . if i just peel the skin off , it 'll be perfect .
oh no . i 'm not tired at all .
we 'll stop for just a moment . then we 'll do the lacrimosa .
nah , see , maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor . he , you know , he tied in with the club . set us up so , you know , you feel at home .
well , i did n't care for the club much . and , i must say , i did n't care for him either .
but if it got late and i had n't shown up ?
then i 'd think there must be a reason .
well , nick , that 's your name , is n't it ?
what 's that got to do with it ? i do n't know you from adam 's off ox . hey , you ! rummy ! come here ! come here !
i 'm in san francisco five days a week . with a lot of time on my hands . i 'd like to see you . maybe we could go swimming or something . mother tells me you like to swim .
how does mother know what i like to do ?
guess who ? it 's your old friend , lex .
luthor , i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you 'd be far away from here by now .
we 've allowed this man his freedom . his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial . has he outlived his usefulness to us ?
no one believes kurtzweil or his books . he 's a toiler . a crank .
then for god 's sake , harvey , cancel the anniversary celebration .
we 've told him we 'll deal . what could he possible have to gain by --
you pay great attention to small things . i hide these as i hide all my books . father would not approve , lest it were the bible .
i , um ... i have something to show you , if you have a moment .
naw , that 's some stupid shit . now you know how i got that name .
negroes kill me , always holdin ' onto , talkin ' 'bout their dicks .
you 're gon na pay for that , pebbles . what ? !
you gave us < u > names < /u > ? what are you , the `` face '' of the fantastic four now ?
`` checkers '' of course , hiss , ike 's heart attack , venezuela , the kitchen debate , and kennedy .
sounds like you got a crisis syndrome . are n't you exaggerating a bit , dick ? call it three-and-a-half , maybe four ...
lem me go ! i did n't go to do it !
keep qui'te , will ya ! shet your mouth !
he 'll care all right . that was going to be his money . whether he cares about us is different . pass your phone .
think about what you 're going to say , ed ; we are on thin ice .
i 've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from .
you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men . and yet you 're able to remain an outsider . with the concomitant air of ... superiority ?
no , i heard you . i just ca n't give the baby to people who describe themselves as `` wholesome . '' i 'm looking for something a little edgier .
what did you have in mind , a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest ?
i told you i do n't like to talk about it .
well , this big stake 's got to be big by now . when you leaving ?
the shaking of the bed , that 's doubtless due to musuclar spasms .
oh no , that was no spasm . i got on the bed , the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking . the whole thing , with me on it !
... so we 've got three guys dead . all newcomers , all killed the same way -- execution style .
warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery ... joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub ...
it has been taken , freylag and all his people slaughtered .
it is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen .
no , she was old and probably senile . maybe schizophrenic .
i saw my death in that eye . and this is not how it happens .
you know okra asked me to marry him the other evening .
rush your mouth , girl . no , he did n't . he can not be that big of a damn fool .
who will it be ? put your mind to it , then .
guenevere . and a beloved friend who will betray you .
the police ? we 'd never live to testify . not against spats colombo . wabash .
we got to get out of town . maybe we ought to grow beards .
at pee dee , all you think about is the future , you know ? gettin ' out ? and what you 'll do and what you 'll think about when you 're on the outside again .
i just think about things as they come up . i never been much of a planner .
oh really ? we 're they `us'es ' or `them 's ' ?
do n't be facetious darling . now drink your milk , you 're late for college
are you out of your mind ? what on earth 'd make us-
i 'll pay you each in advance and i 'll mount you on those .
i 'm not being grouchy . i just want to finish my work .
okay . i understand . i 'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and ... maybe you 'll let me read something then .
i thought if i could spend that kinda money on a car , it 'd mean everything else was fine . i do n't even know how much they cost .
a lot . but you hang in there , maybe you 'll get one .
tradition . royal sense of adventure that 's been in my family for centuries . dates back to the crusades and king richard . what i was born to do .
yeah , tradition 's a bitch , ai n't it ?
delayed shock . or maybe not . i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or ... go to another magazine , someplace ... just not sure if i want to .
guess you do n't have to figure it out until you go home .
twice i took the name of god in vain , once i slept with the brother of my fiancé , and once i bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident .
then it was not a sin . but what was that second thing you said , loretta ?
well , now , mister , that sounds all right . but --
a clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere . money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man . all he needs is a friend to point it out to him . like that !
you hear me , martin ? open the outer door .
chaz , if it 's an organism , and we let it in , the ship will be infected .
it 's a call back service -- a girl will call you back .
i thought i was just gon na be connected to talk to a girl - that 's fine , ok , i 'm sorry , it 's , um ... ..818 ... .
leo 's gon na need his hands , cooch . he does quillwork .
i think leo 's retired from quillwork for the moment .
hey , you know , what can i say , i dig those cute little sweaters she wears .
i 'll bet you do , you little horndog , she 's givin ' you fuckin ' stiffies , right ?
there 's a couple of points i keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you . buddy is it ? and this fella jack foley . i swear the man must 've robbed two hundred banks in his time .
really ? huh . he told me he did n't remember how many he robbed .
well , you be careful with that boy , lula .
sailor ai n't a boy no more , mama .
think about it man . nine men , six bullets .
you think they sold me out ? no way .
`` goodness , gracious , great balls of fire . '' to the killer . jerry lee lewis .
jerry lee lewis , elvis , dinky doo and the do n't 's . let 's book , charlie . if he starts on motown , we 'll be here all night .
i think it was a little more complicated than --
i just wanted to share an apartment . what was so complicated about that ?
and this is my future . this is who i am !
this is who you were . exactly who you are is up to you .
i 'm searching for patterns in the noise , that 's all . order in the chaos . i 'm practicing listening --
the point is , this is n't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it 's turned into some kind of personal obsession .
nicky , the worst thing that could happen on earth is you get killed , in which case , boom , you end up back here .
are you telling me i have to go to earth and kill my brothers ?
before he started to run . he said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck -- and someday we 'd all hear the sound of that key in the door .
we 've got to find him . i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last . and you stay here , norbert , in case he comes home . that 's all he said -- the thing about the key ?
why sure , luke . i mean i did n't talk to them about that . but why not ? they 're reasonable , luke . hell , we only been gone a coupla hours .
you do n't understand a thing , do you , drag ?
well , it 's on ! we 're gon na rock . linda , call vaughan . tell him to get over here . i 'd like him to be here . i owe him a good time .
no doyle . vaughan do n't want to come to a party with you .
civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes . but logan and max , with a song in their hearts are gon na march into battle to keep that from happening .
and whether you want to believe it or not , you already fired the first shot . on another matter , federal corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks -- scars , tattoos . i did a search and came up with this .
yes , you 're right , i do n't understand .
look ... my daughter ... she 's going to die ... unless you can help me .
you mean a symbol of someone who does n't exist .
but you do exist . narcissus : hero of the battle of the danube .
either you 're making a fool out of me because you get off on it , or you got serious problems . which one is it ? !
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
well , it 's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented .
and it 's bullshit . and if i 'm right , are you going to put the journal 's reputation behind a story that 's going to blow up in your face ?
why would n't they ? look at hyenas , jackals , nearly all species of predator birds --
that does n't say a thing about t-rex , they could have been rogues . robert burke certainly thinks they were .
a healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child , she 's given the wrong anesthetic ...
... we , we love her , dick and me ...
lawyer ? i do n't need no lawyer , do i ?
no , of course not . just say it , that 's all .

not like this ... they do n't seem so bright with all the city lights . i never really noticed them much ...
i do n't know . i hope craig got a good idea . we got ta ask him when he comes out . let 's go and clean up before pinky gets here .
maybe you can ask him to loan you the money .
crunch -- my father 's -- you going to kill him ?
you clean out of your head ? come on !
but they do n't have a case against you .
are you kiddin ' ? did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court ? did you see the papers ? `` lamotta on vice rap . '' everybody likes a shot at the champ .
i thought i might , you know , nip it in the bud before it gets worse . because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant .
yeah , typically . that 's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant .
and how did you feel when you ate this guy ?
i do n't know . i do n't remember doing it .
and i think they just came back from masters and johnson .
yeah , intensive care ward . my god-hey , max , i think she 's ... i think she 's giving me the eye .
jos , you 've been to college , you 're successful , you wash your hair now -- you 're not josie grossie anymore .
do n't you realize how much i wanted to be you in high school ? just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular ?
'but i say to you , love your enemies , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who persecute ... '
i 'll tell you who you can pray for ... next payday , i 'll be at tony 's place ... johnny better show or i find him and break his legs ... and i mean it .
five-man job . bustin ' in and bustin ' out of a diamond wholesaler 's .

i 'm sorry , neil . you brought this on yourself .
for god 's sake , elizabeth ... just try to help the kids , will you ? listen to them .
swiped your purse ! while he was saving you ? you got ta be kidding !
and sold it to mister laplante , the fence , who 's now trying to blackmail poor john .
sometimes it 's easier to just rip out the backstraps .
they 'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs .
i was about to say he looked like shit , but hey , sure , he looked like you .
'it 's booty time , it 's booty time , across the u.s.a. it 's booty time ... '
she will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway .
my dear joseph , the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress , he does not want her for his wife .
a woman should not be out alone in these woods .
but , i am not alone , am i ? i only wished to see what you were up to , and ... to thank you .
fatigued , certainly . but dead is a little extreme . on the other hand , when me dear gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live .
it was in the bloody papers , on the telly..what 's this about gradski ?
it 's all set up ... ghost phones and fax , all the usual stuff . you have a suite at the marquis hotel under renquist . okay , reality check . go .
hi , i 'm harry renquist . i own a --
then i 'll fry taking this son of a bitch out . i 'm making the run , dixie .
i 'm getting too old for this shit . one oh four and counting .
well , if you could just come for the day . new york 's only a few hours by plane , i 'd have you home by dinner ...
look , even if it was nearer , that 's just not what i do . i give clinics . and i 'm not even doing them for a while . i 'm heading back to montana right now . i got a ranch to take care of ...
look at all that meat . is n't she the bitter end !
give it back . you must not arouse yourselves .
ca n't get a little bit pregnant , bud .
it 's a winner mr. mannheim , trust me -- buy .
barstows miles to the left . los angeles a hundred to the right . wherever youre heading , i reckon somebodyll pick you up .
huh ... i suppose the idea of a one day trip to los angeles doesnt appeal to you ...
i mean , jesus christ , bob . you did n't have some vicious lunatic screaming , `` i 'm going to remember you ! ''
that 's true . that would give me nightmares .
nothing ! swear to god , i did n't do nothing !
look , you did something that set it off . try to remember . concentrate . tell me exactly what you did ! !
i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight ?
this is n't some 's porno film , you dip shit . there are no wild sex orgies .
i do n't expect an apology and i do n't even want one . i just want us to --
i ca n't fucking believe this guy . an apology , bob ?
and , you seem in excellent health , your highness .
ah , well , my dear madame de montesquiou , peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness .
aw , you ai n't disturbing me , but it kind of looks like rain , do n't ya think ?
my name is lt. wydell , i 'd like to ask you a few questions .
come on , sherm . you 're my cousin . do this for me . i 'm begging you .
i ca n't do it , louis . it is n't ethical . i could lose my license .
no , i just do n't feel like it . that 's all .
why do n't you just try ? please . for me . come on .
i fucked her ! okay ? i fucked her . i 'm sorry . but that 's what the hell i did .
do you know what i gave up to be with you ?
three years i 've worked for the railroad . now i do n't know why . it seemed a good idea once .
i feel the same about the bridge . this country certainly did n't ask for it , does n't need it .
yeah , i said i - let the bullshit blow over for a while so i can run the casino . anything goes wrong with the casino , it 's my ass . it 's not yours , it 's my ass .
oh , i do n't know whether you know this or not , but you only have your fuckin ' casino because i made that possible !
yeah , man , it means love , respect , community ... and the dollars too . the package . the kwan .
but how did you get `` kwan ? '' _ .
eleven years ago . oh , it was dark ... he was big for his age ... damn ray gun he had looked real enough ... yeah , i had all the right excuses ... but afterwards ... i really could n't draw my gun again .
i ... i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to make a joke of it .
did you hear what thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us .
that 's impossible . i told them jacks died of a sudden heart attack , probably brought on by over drinking .
lancelot , how did you fare in the north ?
we spared the lives of a few , so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of king arthur 's knights ...
i 'm all right , mom . i 'm not in siberia , you know .
did you have a nice flight ? are they taking good care of you ?
i felt that you could do better for yourself --
what ? become a nun ? you did n't want me going out with anglos --
martin ... i want you to know some- thin ' ...
yeah ... you want me to know i ai n't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man 's clothes to wear ! ..you tole me that already ... now shut your head !
you guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he 's talking about .
come on , chief , you think about it , the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we 're more like clergy than cops .
there 's my little darling . the night would n't be complete without you .
yeah , mom cut me some slack -- but i decided ... i 'd like to be here for you . here , mom . you can have it back . thanks , though .
no , but i might have some indian chief tonic .
i have n't heard anyone mention swamp root since button-up shoes went out .
rapidamente ! everybody in the world is going to see !
donde vamos ? [ where are we going ? ]
that noise do n't come from no ordinary bird .
it may be just a cricket or a critter in the trees .
okay . so ... what , uh ... what just happened ? just now ? jus then ? in there ?
i do n't know . i , uh -- i frankly do n't even want to talk about it .
what do you expect ? for them to bring it up here ?
we ca n't go down there . we 're not prepared . that deep ? that takes years of training , beth . we 're just scientists . lab scietists . we wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks .
mr. fairlane , i 'm very rich . the kind of rich that warps minds . nothing offends me . when i was eleven , i walked in on my father and the shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday . does that excite you ?
i do n't know , i never met your father .
she is n't a part of this . this is between you and me .
call up petrov and order stravanavitch ' s release .
forty years . that 's a long time for any crime , even murder .
it 's a hell of a lot longer when you 're innocent .
it must be wonderful to be so smart . i do n't see how you do it , reading all those books , learning all that stuff .
rose , you work too hard . why do n't you go sit down somewhere and drink a co-cola ?
yeah - that 's all that 's worrying you . what do i want ? a chance to feed a wife and kids ! i 'm a farmer . a job ! that 's what i want !
a farmer , eh ! you 're a moocher , that 's what you are ! i would n't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles ! you 're a moocher like all the rest of them around here , so get out of here !
george , listen to what you 're saying . this thing 's changed itself into a man . disappearing may not be that big a deal .
so far you 've let it cross the heart of america . for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security . i do n't see the humor in that .
did n't have a choice . my car overheated up the road .
good luck it did n't happen a few miles back . maybe they never would have found you . day like today you 'd be dead for sure .
no ... metropolis is a confusing place . back in smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple . people would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand .
that 's not what we were taught . 'look out for number one ' -- that 's daddy 's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold .
maybe you should go , alex.you 'll meet someone wonderful .
for my life ? at a discussion group ? i think not .
i hope you noticed how coolly i behaved under the threat of discovery .
do justice and the fbi know what we know , and why the hell have n't they done anything about it ?
she 's on to him . you shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is , he kin run her crazy .
it ai n't my fault you do n't know how to handle your dogs .
the ex-ship news ' reporter . no body , no voice , all mind !
the gong rang . the fight 's over . calm down .
yes , i feel their spirits . cora ... keaton ... i am here to communicate ...
no , they sold the house in to a millionaire , uriah bloodworth .
i 'll call them and tell them you 're taking your time . being a professional .
okay , call them . fine . oh -- and if you could find out why they double- booked the job , and who is trying to kill me , and call me back -- that 's be great .
why do you say things like that ? you 're so much better than you know .
thank you . if i had that kind of support on a daily basis , i could definitely shape up by the turn of the century .
i 'm curious , mr. boone . what convinced you to come back ?
i do n't know . i guess i like your stories .
i want you to take a look at this girl here . she 's been in some porn stuff .
no , andy . do n't know the kid .
the radiation is not an anomaly , it 's the clue . this creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur .
do n't tell me why it 's not , tell me what the hell it is .
uh-huh . another news clipping . another one about sid 's mom . dewey , whether we like it or not it looks like we 're going to have to go back into our past .
you mean our past as in me and sid . this has nothing to do with you gale .
... will you stay with me till they get here ?
do n't worry about it , barton . we can sort it-
damn , sis , you do n't keep no food up in here in dis ' piece .
i order out mostly . so what do i owe this visit to ?
you see for me it 's over . over baby . i 'm gon na turn myself in . after the wedding of course . after the wedding . out of respect .
i do n't think that 's a good idea .
what makes you think they were lesbians , or as you so quaintly put it , dykes ?
come on , they were a little old for a slumber party .
fuck that redneck noise , dude . all dem chicks be rappin ' how dey losin ' der ' ho 's and how dey ai n't got no bread for beer . fuck dat honky shit . got to get me some motown jams , dig it ?
whaddaya talking shit for man . hey junior ! y'ever smoke any shit ?
oh my god , does this mean you 're becoming normal ?
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we 're going .
it 's ... i do n't know . first world war , right ?
correct . the fields of france . and many dead flowers ... oh . forgive me . my name was spenser . elliott spenser . captain .
all right , tell us , rose , what makes you think you 're pregnant ?
i have n't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big .
yes . you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out .
no , as a matter of fact , i did n't .
ahh , shit . we 're pretty much tapped out . i 'm getting denied access all over the place ...
it 's not very much to go on ... is there anything else we can check ?
yes . it 's not a very good name , is it ? but we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need !
er ... + you are the keepers of the holy grail ?
what is wrong with old habits , mr. overstreet ?
they perpetuate mechanical living , sir . they limit your mind .
you okay , man ? i mean , what just happened .
the venom of bad memories . you were there ; you saw her . i saw you seeing her .
oh , i fell on my keys . i 've got to get out of here .
you miserable , cowardly , wretched little caterpillar . do n't you ever want to become a butterfly ? do n't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory ?
i ca n't go through with it , i tell you .
your perfect . your bitter and you 're strong .
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion . but keep in mind , even the arts are n't free of aggressive content , nor the institution of marriage .
i think these cold , `` objective '' discussions are aggressive , samia ...
parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home .
look , i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win . okay ? i 'm not interested in the scoop anymore . excuse me .
i-i could n't think where to invite you without taking risks .
i promised myself i would n't let this happen till you were living alone . i was so torn when you called .
yeah . i 'm extremely worried about that . it 's right up there with global warming .
on our way home , a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield . terminate us instantly . we 'd never experience what it means to make love .
you were right , mr. dickson ! brown did n't have anything to do with it . here 's your man .
why , you must be crazy . i 've known this man for years .
i want to see that . do you mind if i stay ... on the side ? i wo n't bother you .
no , no -- you ca n't stay or they wo n't come !
i just do n't think it 's right , keepin ' him under wraps like we 's ashamed of him .
well if that is pete i am ashamed of him . the way i see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a babylon . these things-
leave us alone , stephens . leave the people of this town alone . you ca n't help .
you can help each other . several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit . your case as an individual will be stronger if i 'm allowed to represent you together as a group .
this is stupid . it 'd be just too easy .
we 'll take a look at him . talk to him .
no . you just looked as if you did .
no . just as if i 'd like to .
i ca n't help . i ca n't help anyone .
why , sure you can , buzz . you can get me out of here and then i 'll get that rocket off you , and we 'll make a break for andy 's house .
just smile again and be reasonable . i 'll order dinner here -- just the two of us -- like old times .
-- and you swear when you get to the other side , you 'll never come near either of us again ?
all the same , someday you 'll lie to laszlo . you 'll be there .
no , rick . no , you see , victor laszlo is my husband ... and was , even when i knew you in paris .
yeah and they forgot to ask for one who was n't having hormone surges .
oh come on harry , we 're talking about five days here .
worse . i have betrayed you . i do not expect you to forgive me .
forgive you ? i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass !
it 's hard to tell , there all chewed up .
loomis , it 's over . leave it alone .
yeah , ya should 've come along with us , miss ratched , an ' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two .
mr. mcmurphy , you had no right to take these men out with you !
oh , the whole family loved him . of course , they loved the last guy i went out with , and he strung me along for three years and dumped me .
really ? you see , to me , you should n't have any trouble with men . there should be , like , a line behind you .
sally , first of all , you 're talking bullshit . and second ...
you want to talk about bullshit ? lucy called you three times this week . she 's a fucking mess , joe . your sister is a fucking mess . she needs you . i talk to her more than you do .
what ? if i was in nicolet 's place ?
no , i mean you , right now . not it you were somebody else .
what am i supposed to do after i get my nails and hair done ... ?
reality tv and stay by the phone . that 's what all wives-in-crime do ...
she is n't anybody 's friend , and i do n't like you living with her . she 's a bad influence .
nonsense . she 's one of the nicest girls i know .
that was al on the phone . he wants me to meet him out at the fawcett place . says some detectives from santa rosa 'll be there in a little while . will you be all right here ?
yes . i was just taking her in some tea .
put down the gun and i 'll take your statement . okay ?
you 're the boss . just do n't make me repeat myself . i hate that .
jesus , steven , that 's ... that 's really lovely .
i mean , how can you go through life without never having made a prank call ?
does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow , or could you hold off for a few days maybe ?
for one night in your life , do you think it 's possible for us to be completely real ?
how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
and why the fuck would you do that for me ?
not for you , ray . for me . a close friend of mine was killed this week . the way i figure it , i stop you from doin ' what you said , i 'm one up on body count .
it 's okay ... you 're going to be okay .
i want to go home . i want off this ship .
is that what they teach you at that school of yours ? kind of , sort of ? everyone knows about this except me ! do you know how humiliating that is ?
i would 've told you , and you would have stopped calling , like a baby .
somehow , i got the feeling that did n't help us very much .
threepio , tell them if they do n't do as you wish , you 'll become angry and use your magic .
when you say your sexual relations with miss lawson were intense what exactly do you mean ?
it was like she was trying to push me as far as she could . she called it opening new doors .
you look so well , clair . a wraith .
you think so ! ? i 've been working out a lot since the baby . and i 've been working . and that takes it 's toll , you know .
no . it 's not enough ... i told you before that i would like to get away for a while and be alone .
but you just said that a month was too ...
he finished it . he wrote the worst notice i ever read about the girl he loved . we ran it in every paper .
i guess mr. kane did n't think so well of susie 's art anyway .
to me , it would mean that you 're a liar . you saw it twice . once with laura -- oops -- once with me and dick . we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the fourteenth century .
yeah , yeah , i know . but say i had n't seen it and i said to you , `` i have n't seen evil dead ii yet , '' what would you think ?
you snore at night . that bugs me . can i take you out ?
your brothers are right . it was the most god-awful smell i 've ever had my nose around .
and what do you think you might have said ?
i think i might 've said i was in love with you .
. . . and they call me a fucking nut .
adrian . itšs too late . the world is blowing up as we stand here .
well , are you satisfied now ? can we just lie and talk , huh ?
hmmph . it has a nipple , all right .
because when i scheduled it i did n't realize it was a holiday . you were there , why did n't you say something ?
look at the calendar , for christ 's sake . you said a sunday , not easter sunday .
are you sure ? jack -- this is not something you have to do .
i 'm sure . when you 've led the kind of life that i have , there are debts that must be paid . maybe i can balance the scales a little .
do n't tell them about adcox ... do n't let 'em ...
i 'm sorry ... i 'm sorry i thought ... i wo n't .
are you implying that my motives are less than sincere ?
yes , but that 's not the issue . what 's on your wish list , ed ? pleading kim out to first degree man on both homicides , with an agreed sentence of to life running concurrent ? come on ... what 're you looking for here ?
well , let 's not exaggerate . i take pictures . you line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter . no need to mess around with all that artisto crap .
i 'd like to see your pictures some day .
you 're an amazing woman . what a feeling having you inside my head .
yeah . it was an unusual place to be .
ah , doolittle , i do have a malfunction on this readout , but i ca n't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is .
do n't worry about it . we 'll find out when it goes bad .
my attorney , she 's just outta law school , about a couple of years older than my kid , for chrissake .
you got ta kid ? how old 's your kid ?
now wait a minute , hawkeye . i come a long way , learning to put up with a couple of crazy yankees , but ...
do n't tell me about your problems , boy . explain them to ho-jon .
fat sam left the beach today . so did gummy . it began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe i should be aware of .
i said i 'll take care of it . now , a man of your position should n't be a part of what 's about to go down . so go home and i 'll call you tomorrow .
how are the hometown folks treating you , back in xenia ?
well , jay . they 've been exceptionally supportive .
welcome , mr. miller . jim garrison . would you care for some coffee ?
yes , thank you , mr. garrison . your coffee 's almost turkish down here but i could get used to it .
i see . you 're good , because i did n't hear anything .
yeah . i put a rag on the strings , to lessen noise .
... ... ... ... ... right there . four numbers ... that 's two hundred and thirty eight dollar ... merry christmas and shit ...
ticket bad . you draw in lines with pencil .
kevin , next year ... with you in ann arbor , and me in nashville ... it 's not gon na work , is it .
do n't say that , we can do it somehow . it might not be perfect , but --
we ... we went to school together . college .
did you ! imagine that ! how long will you be staying ?
somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you 've done your job , x , head back to prague . i 'll be landing in minutes . this is my operation now .
we do n't have that kinda time , boss , i do n't think prague 's gon na be around much longer . i 've got ta go now . i 've got a lot of bad guys to kill .
yes , sir . but what about the disks ? if the cops end up with the disks , we 're gon na see a whole lot of heat .
i hate that mickey mouse bastard . i hated his father , and i hate sonny , too . always with the tan .
oh , you 're a rapper , huh ? you got a record contract ?
not yet -- `` give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust -- ''
alan , we still have to control this guy ...
and look at this . russell came around on the trade bill .
that much magic i can offer ye , a small measure of entertainment at best . making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers .
then , what 's gone wrong ? why did it happen ?
they were pretty clear they did n't want this coming back on them .
well , that 's all i can do . sorry .
he 's probably made copies . he 's not going to give them up to us .
forget the copies ! he could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original .
well , do n't jump down my throat . i 'm just trying to help .
how is that helping , natalie ? how exactly ?
i know . mr. eichelberger -- in the mortgage loan department -- last night he had a little halloween party here --
well , lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it .
if this is their ship 's data banks , where is the crew ? or is their entire ship automated ?
captain , i do not believe there < u > is < /u > a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such .
sit down , this concerns you too . i do n't need to say that your department 's handling of the black panthers -- particularly inspector brimmer 's `` undercover operation '' has been a complete travesty .
just hold on a god damn minute . i ...
of course he thinks he can beat me , bert . he would n't be playing me if he did n't . right , felson ?
i did n't ask him can he beat you . i already know he can beat you . i asked him will he ? with eddie , that 's two different things .
i 'll always remember it . if i had n't remembered it , i would n't have divorced you .
you know , hildy , i sort of wish you had n't done it .
you mean it 's just lying around someplace -- all that cash ?
or a safe deposit key , a certified check , a baggage claim -- you look for it , mrs. lampert -- i 'm quite sure you 'll find it .
sorry , son . this is a matter for adults .
officers , i 've never said the p-word out loud , much less written it down !
i ca n't . they trust me , they accept me . i 've got their confidence .
no , i mean maybe we should back off a bit , you and me .
this is where he marked on the map , scully . where he says those fossils were unearthed .
i do n't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite . not even a sewer or a storm drain .
-- i guarantee she wo n't gain an once . she 's very disciplined .
well , we have to do something about this -- `` stuntwoman '' .
man , what 's this about ? ya know , you were robbing a store . it was n't personal . it was his job .
fuck you ! you know what he did to me ? ! ...
took a guess . lucky for you , i guessed right .
who the fuck are you ? who do you work for ?
maybe if i kiss him i 'll feel it .
or maybe it 'll turn him back into a toad .
sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor . the son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice .
so all of our intel was bogus to begin with .
you 're his friend , jack . why ca n't you leave him alone ?
because it 's his bad luck to be special .
in the necropolis , when i saw him , - alive , ... walking , he called me anck- su-namun . and then in mister burns ' quarters he tried to kiss me .
it is because it was you who read from the book . he has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of anck-su-namun .
veronica . and jesse james . quelle surprise . hear about veronica 's affection for regurgitation ?
we both said a lot of things we did n't mean , last night .
so how come you do n't have any kids ?
darryl , that 's my husband , he says he 's not ready . he 's still too much of a kid himself . he prides himself on being infantile .
it 's just not low enough . this is the scene . we have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky . as towering virtues in combat --
spare me the aria , i know what you want --
so when are you authorized to use deadly force ?
well , a 'course , taxes provide your basic service -- police and whatnot . but our customers need a little more than just that , you understand ? this badge does n't mean that i am a peace officer .
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay . it is not often we have so distinguished a visitor .
thank you . i hope you 'll forgive me , captain , but the present french administration has not always been so cordial . may i present miss ilsa lund ?
we 're not going anywhere . not 'til we get what we came for .
we just about got killed . you know what happened ? we just about got killed , and you want to go on ?
no , no , it 's not a threat , i 've explained all of that .
i 'm actually a little relieved you 're going , to be honest . i think we 've seen enough of each other for a while .
ca n't nobody read minds long distance . all he have to do is ask somebody .
why ? why he have to ask ? ca n't nobody offer ? what 's going on ? since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog ? !
look , i must have pupils . without pupils i ca n't manage .
you do n't mean to tell me you are living in poverty ?
is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday ?
no . mister harding , that is not true .
yes . i 'm the only one . i have to enter malkovich and destroy him from the inside . if not me , who ?
if there was any way i could go in your place . but i 'm only a monkey and ...
i 'm afraid that 's hardly the sort of security i was thinking of -- you see -- there is that promising little fellow , your son ...
no ! no ! no ! not him -- not my son -- i 'd rather go with you -- right now .
leave me alone , brother . i 've never seen you before . tramp shouts to other meths drinkers and tramps .
this is the poisonous young swine that near done me in . him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me . alex breaks away again .
i ca n't help you , sorry . i 'm not here to teach remedial reporting .
and it has nothing to do with the fact i left your room instead of staying there ?
you 'll have to become used to it , child , if you accept the crown ...
`` if '' i accept ? ! of course i 'm going to accept ! it 's what i always wanted !
it 's good to be king , hey charles ?
kings are out of fashion . i 'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant . it 's an anti-trust action .
not a bad idea . if our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change . now , i do n't mind letting you have our horses , but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers .
oh , sure . we have horse maneuvers every morning .
so we 've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements , my wonderful men .
terrific . we 're all going to be rich and famous .
max has gone to a great deal of trouble , it 's going to be an elaborate party , and it 's for you .
no , it 's not . it 's for this .
but you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
there is no wisdom , no insight , no plan
sure , i 'll take her up to eight hundred .
could you take her up right now , king ? other- wise we 'll get kind of close to the fireball .
jesus . twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already .
ninety-two . only gon na get hotter . i remember one time . . .
we 're leaving , do n't try and stop us .
you 're not going anywhere . you hear me ? i 'm still your father .
i came up here after kevin 's father died . they were very supportive and helped me adjust . i got myself together . i 've gotten myself together now , too .
small difference : i 'm not dead , yet .
-- what do i ? -- i put the name of the person i came to see ? --
-- this is serious business down here and we can not have people coming and going --
we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery . let 's turn back .
no . it 's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind .
comrades ! comrades ! do n't let 's give in so quickly . after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia .
all right , let 's uphold it for another ten minutes .
well , ya know , doc ... does n't it say so there ?
well , according to the warden at pendleton , you were a disturbing influence on others . 'it appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates . ' what do you think of that report ?
but mr. webster ... you 're doin ' okay with brazil and them other places . what 's wrong with just one little old country doin ' their own thing ?
a very wise man once said ... i think it was attila the hun ... `` it 's not enough that i succeed . everyone else must fail . '' and you are going to do it for me .
i mean , why did you get married ? was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
i got married because betsy said we had to break up or get married . so we get married .
demon ! demon ! that 's why you can walk on it ! demon !
oh , cole , please . please come out of it . what would i do without you ?
`` the female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves . '' see i knew you never loved mark .
who is this madame sconce ? let 's find her and talk to her .
i 've still got a few teeth in my head , mr. gittes , and a few friends in town .
okay . my secretary 'll send you a letter of agreement . tell me are you worried about that girl , or what evelyn might do to her ?
yeah , the guy with the bmw i told you about . i did , did n't i ?
here 's my theory . twombley , unaware of illegal union loans or whatever , starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son-in-law is involved .
forgive me now for seeming personal , but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in provo .
what the hell does this have to do with insurance ?
so give him a tour . he does n't know enough to ask the right questions .
if he 's looking for a flaw in the system --
well , to tell you the truth , gentlemen , i 've sworn off playing poker .
why , you would n't quit when you 're ahead , would you ?
this was the reverend porter 's wife , you have her looking like a two dollar hooker .
i think she looks nice ! her lips are very thin so i used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality , and her eyes just needed a little definition , and her hair , i 'm sorry , nobody wears this hairdo anymore in .
i do n't know . he do n't seem like a guy that 'd fall into line .
when you 're desperate for money , you do a lot of things , mr. connell . he 's our man , i tell you .
are you crazy ? ! you ca n't do this .
this is it jos ! this is my ninth inning ! the game is n't over -- i just thought it was ! i get on the southglen baseball team , the right scout sees me -- i 'm into the minors- it 's game time !
it could be a purely impersonal thing . what matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions .
you should have been a marriage counselor . but i 'll show you what 's wrong with your theory .
you 're one fuckin ' bastard , merle . you know that ? you 're one fucking bastard !
this is this , vince . this is n't something else . this is this !
we could work together . then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . there 's a beach in bora bora with my name on it .
a beach named x ? that i 'd like to see .
well , you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger . you wore jeans and t-shirts , and so did i. and i still do , and you do n't .
because i 'm not allowed to . i still do , after work . so , what ? should we just break up ? is that what you 're saying ? because if you are , i 'm going to run out of patience .
no ! you ca n't ! they 're in on it .
i do n't see how they could be in on it . they 're the best . they 're hand- picked .
sustained . in all fairness , dr. zira , you must admit the accused is a nonape , and therefore has no rights under ape law .
then why is he called the accused your honors must think him guilty of something .
dormer . still no sign of the bullet that went through farrell .
i 'm going to the hospital to talk to him now . you get the search party together . no fewer than thirty people . i 'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes . do n't waste any time .
we got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together . the day after that they 're shippin ' mallory . that 's when we do the mickey knox interview , 'cause the next day he goes .
would the network really not run it without the interview ?
okay ... would you rather ... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a super-model for a month , or make love to a otter on crank for a week ?
soft . i 'll take the junkie otter , clearly ! i 'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants ... okay . would you rather make love to the candied corpse of phyllis diller --
an angel is like you , kate , and you are like an angel .
o bon dieu ! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies .
you 're taking `` no '' for an answer ?
no . i 'm not going to take `` no '' for an answer . no .
as to that , i do n't know , charlie ... we had n't got around to talkin ' marriage ...
what right you got to be talkin ' marriage to any decent woman ...
i think some people are meant to be alone . maybe i was a man in a former life and i used women for pleasure so now i 'm paying for it - which would be fine , if i could just remember some of the pleasure parts ...
i do n't understand you . what is the problem ?
del 's dead , by the way . i sent him to the great beyond .
actually , i scalped him , and then you killed him .
that 's too bad . that 's casablanca 's leading commodity . in refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market .
suppose you run your business and let me run mine .
but you ca n't explode in the bomb bay . it 's foolish . you 'll kill us all . there 's no reason for it .
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
... face '' crap you 've been telling me ?
i was not in the man 's face . i was nego- ...
i 'm sorry , kelly . i 'm sorry it had to happen like this . she was losing it ...
there was no way . that cop would 've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ...
well , do n't blame me . i told you .
i do blame you , bob . and woah . look at her .
do n't make me raise my hand to you . you have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction .
ca n't i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong ? the world is not black and white . show me one perfect person . if you ca n't , do n't ask me to be .
oh brad - mmmm - oh yes , my darling - what if ...
it 's alright janet . everything 's going to be alright .
thanks a lot . no respect from my offspring --
par for the course ... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner ?
what ? fuck french people . fuck 'em in the ear .
mkay , you see , children . this is exactly what i 'm talking about . we have to change the way you think .
in a way . you find yourself trying to say what you mean , but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you 're not saying what you mean , but what he means-
do you expect me to believe that you did n't say any of those things - that they were all addison ?
hi , lins . i thought you were in houston .
i was , but i managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here . only here is n't where i left it , is it , bud ?
because ... we 're just friends . that 's all . just friends . walter i get it . i see the whole thing now . no one knows if walter paisley is born !
jeez , what is your problem all of a sudden ?
well , to tell you the truth , i 'm having some trouble getting started
getting started ! christ jesus ! started ? ! you mean you do n't have anything ? !
that 's a nice tour . all booked ? when was susie around here last ?
four five nights ago . that 's how i know the romance is off . also steve 's in a very bad mood .
margo . bill is all of eight years younger than you .
those years stretch as the years go on . i 've seen it happen too often .
i have to think about my future . and what people expect from me .
so you 're breaking up with me because you 're afraid your family wo n't like me ? everybody likes me !
i mean , i 've done what i came to do . it should n't hurt this much . but it will pass ...
right . you sure i ca n't just take you to the emergency ward ?
just because i 'm not a vanderbilt , all of a sudden i 'm white trash ? i grew up in bel air , warner ! across the street from aaron spelling ! i think most people would agree that 's way better than a vanderbilt --
i told you , elle . i need someone -- serious .
i buy my shirts by the dozen . fortunately .
where did it all come from ? or is that a permissible question ?
i know i have n't seen you in four days . i 'm a working man .
i work too , but i still make time .
yeah , well he left out a couple of steps , ah look , i 've got ta get back to these bills , phil will you help vada get settled ?
come on ... i 'll show you where you 're gon na stay .
i 'm not an idiot , man . i watch tv .
i know . i 'm sorry . i 'm just ... a little nervous , i do n't know why .
yeah , well , we all got our little problems today do n't we ?
he has come to help mister burns . somehow i feel responsible .
and blow up the universe just to prove he 's right ? bit egotistical , is n't it ?
a messianic complex is nothing new to octavius . in his universe , there 's only one mind -- his own . it must be very lonely .
this stuff . love and marriage . i want to think about something else .
i 've changed my mind . that 's the most romantic thing i 've ever heard . i do . i will .
okay , if brooke did n't kill the guy , who did ?
my money 's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife .
ma'am , i 'm very sorry about your problems and i appreciate what your daughter must be going through , but i 'm afraid you 've misunderstood whatever it is you read . i do n't do that sort of thing .
well , if you could just come for the day . new york 's only a few hours by plane , i 'd have you home by dinner ...
you must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in . it would n't have been so bad , but even the medical officer for the district was killed !
i did read that . they gave him a posthumous medal .
i do n't think you could have a real affair . you could n't care for anyone .
i 've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but i 've never hit one with dough . this love-in-an-attic is n't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon .
thanks , but miss dawson and i are going out to see the sights .
fine , fine . swell , you just showed me a sight lovely to behold , and i 'd like to reciprocate . listen , you hop aboard my magic carpet thanks - and i 'll show you sights that you 've never seen before .
what you mean you ai n't goin ' ? we *got* to go . we got no place to stay .
i ai n't talkin ' about you , i 'm talkin ' about me . and i 'm a-stayin ' . i give her a good goin ' over all night long -- and i 'm a-stayin ' .
do you think your friend 's up in heaven now , looking down on you and watching you all the time ?
well , i hope he 's not watching me all the time .
he 's alone , tired , hunted , and has n't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you 're going to do to him ? robinson , wake up and smell the shit you 're shoveling !
anytime you want to go home , sergeant ... consider yourself dismissed .
kay , we were n't expecting you . you should call ...
i 've tried calling and writing . i want to reach michael .
i thought i was over the dreams for good . i really did . i had n't had one for months .
it just takes time , julie . it 's gon na get better .
yeah ! that 's what i 'm saying ! and it was lying next to him . and he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
wait . wait . the chains . where did the chains come from ?
he does have a point . that 's just not the way i 'd like to see it proven .
you feel sorry for solaris , or for me ?
state of israel . if you will it , dude , it is no --
what the fuck 're you talking about ? the carrier . what 's in the fucking carrier ?
sorry , mate , i 'll get you another .
all down my fucking front , you fucking idiot .
look , i 've got to talk to her . this is n't a contest we want the whole country entering .
i agree . if she 's going to advertise , i would n't recommend out-of-town papers . amity people could take care of this .
only very rarely . you see , it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted .
suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he did n't give a hang if it was good manners or not ?
the last two years , i 've been a limousine driver , but i do n't see well anymore , so ...
so you saw me on tv and you said `` hey , let me jump on this . ''
i did n't even have to coax her tonight .
that 's because she made a promise , and she'a keeping it , are n't you , darling . you saw the way she played this afternoon , edward .
i do n't , but ... i do . it 's just ... i love you , bruce . i do n't want you to ...
vicki . do you love half of me ? or all of me ?
i left four messages . you do n't return my calls .
so ? i never returned your calls , even when we were married . and what 's fisher doing here anyway ?
`` i 'm telling you god 's words , not to hustle . ''
you want a new car ? you want a new house ? is that it ? it 's the money , right ?
from another planet . oh , i almost forgot ... they have green blood and pointed ears .
and you know all this ... because < u > you 're < /u > a space-man too ...
a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears , asking for comfort , comfort because she was too old to have any children . not that she wanted to , but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility .
it 's not that ... it 's not that ...
that 's the first thing i did . smooch the ground and taste the freedom . sorry i was late . miss anything ?
your timing , and your shoes , are impeccable ... good to see you , alex , been having a lousy day .
i 'll never die . you tell the girls that . you honor our ancestors and i 'll be there . every night . at the table of life .
your daughters need more than some vapors ; they need you !
i can take care of my own bills , lilly .
whatever you say . the manager says your boss called . really pulled the wool over everybody 's eyes , huh ?
you going to attack me too . the show is a hit . are n't you happy for me ?
of course i 'm happy for you . you 've worked very hard for your success .
show me the tapes . i want to see them .
not yet . < b > int . cast winnebago -- next < /b > alf pulls onto the freeway .
what the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night ? i thought we had a deal ?
hey , you 're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world . i took a shot . it did n't work . did you bring the tapes ?
hey -- you 're into me for a buck already . i say -- mcgann . shoot the whole dollar .
okay . for the dollar , i give you mcgann *and* bill and carl . i got paine . hello ... oh , yes .
your mother ? jesus , miles , we were supposed to be up there hours ago .
it 's her birthday tomorrow . and i do n't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in , okay ? it 'll just take a second . she 's right off the freeway .
trust me . you do trust me , do n't you ?
of course . we went to school together . you 're my oldest friend .
look , you said you were n't feeling great . i thought you should rest .
bullshit . you 'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you .
do n't worry ! the kids will love it --
but i do n't do drugs ! and i do n't enjoy making light of them ! i was promised creative control !
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband . she is now mrs. john best .
mrs. john best ! was there another mr. john best ? !
day-day , if you do n't hop that fence i'mma throw you over .
i ai n't scared of you . we ai n't little no more .
how about anything , anything you want to do .
hard to argue with that , is n't it ...
i know that , claire . i , we < u > all < /u > know ...
everybody , they , they , they treat me like a ...
sorry , do n't mean to be wolfing down . i 'm just starving .
do n't apologize . it 's great to see a woman really enjoying her food . i hate it when i buy a woman dinner and she wo n't even touch it .
hey , sam , bet ya two bucks ya lose .
shit , man , tha ' ai n't even worth considerin ' .
arnie , i need money . somebody threatened my children . they want a first payment of three million dollars .
helena , if i had it i would give it to you , but i do n't have that kind of money .
we 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
oh , no , thank you . the two girls have taken wonderful care of me . i 'm just fine .
let 's do it ! it 's marcus , love , only for you .
male diff breather , approximately , houston and a .
so you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room ... how did friedman say he got to know where to find me ?
thats the beauty . an anonymous call . makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to , eh , french-fuck ?
they 're among the best divisions the british have . no conscripts , no impressed recruits , just professional killers .
it 's a wonder they find the british cause worth dying for .
why ? her career ? she got enough out of it . she 's not forgotten . she still gets those fan letters .
i would n't look too closely at the postmarks .
no , holly -- wait ! he 's running . tell them the rest !
he 's the one . you too . i remember . he was in a hurry . just a face job . dark hair , i said . then he killed doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and i ran ... i ran .
you 're missing most of your life , jim , and you do n't even know it . the kids are missing out too . it 's not just you making the sacrifice here , honey .
look , i 'll rush and be there by two , i promise . go ahead without me .
i just have to relax a little . not feel so guilty all the time .
we can still go back . i 'll walk you home . you sleep a couple of hours , watch some tv , take a bath .
you 're calling me a pestilence ? that 's a hoot !
i 'm sorry . that was unkind and -- but , we changed our minds . did you really mean what you said on the phone . it was n't because you found out about rex ?
i hear your show was sold out already . there 's a very important collector who 's interested in some of your works .
bring him over sometime . i have some other stuff to show him .
dad , you and i have talked about this . lloyd and i have talked about this . believe me , this is well-covered territory .
diane , i 'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy . give him a present , here , let him know you still care . give him this pen .
mmm . but tonight i can take what is his .
only thing you 'll get from that clown is a faster way to die . lao to the contrary ...
what 's good about it ? i miss him something fierce .
i mean this is good dialogue along in here . it 'll play .
right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- nobody else will have him .
you 're welcome . sow how does it feel to ... i know you got ta go -- me too . we 're very busy here .
if anyone deserves it , it 's spengler and me . we 're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment .
yeah , but i introduced you guys . you never would 've met if not for me . that 's got to be worth something .
and you think group one is at war with group two .
latest casualty ? ernest harriman . you heard of him ?
so have i. but i 've never been in love . is n't that awful ?
awful ? no . it 's just lonely . it 's the loneliest time .
codswollop ! ian , you 've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island !
i certainly have ! very clearly ! because of the behavior of the system in phase space !
look , you 'll be back in town tomorrow night . we 'll have dinner -- talk it over .
i wo n't be back . i 've requested the atlanta run .
then why kidnap them ? why not just kill them ?
`` ay , there 's the rub . '' take a look at this file on professor morton . quite a brilliant fellow ... metallurgy .
look at all this beautiful food , so lovingly prepared ...
they 'll eat it anyway , you ever been to a walk ?
i think we asked for `` special programs '' and they gave us `` special prisons . ''
yeah , well -- it 's only one word difference .
yes . before we hand in the next video - i put titles on it and my credit is going to read - directed by oleg razgul .
yes . but there 's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - i do n't share credit .
so that explains his press notices . working both sides of the fence : jewboy henry , always trying to get his nobel prize , get laid ...
my god , my god ! he talked to the new york times ?
well , sure ... that 's good , then . all i mean is , i 'm lucky i met you .
i do n't think so , homer . *i'm* the lucky one .
what ? come on . she 's got a good thing with victor --
i 'm sorry , did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws ?
this thing just went up a degree . ice cream 's not workin ' .
this river 's fed by a glacier . willing to bet my life that it 's a good deal under fifty degrees .
cactus -- shooting a man in the back is not very noble .
that is not a man , captain god . that is vomit accidentally born with two legs .
i mean , nicky 's a made guy and i 'm not . i ca n't do that .
be careful . gaming agents are all over the place .
i 'll have to ask you for that film .
i just wanted to distract them . i was n't trying to get a picture of you .
oh , stop it . but you were having an affair with your college professor . that jerk that teaches that incredible crap course `` contemporary crisis in western man '' !
`` existential motifs in russian literature '' ! you 're really close .
an ' the nex ' thing you know you 'll be out , because they got it all figgered down to a t -- until the harvest is in you 're a *migrant* worker -- afterwards , just a bum .
five they 're a-gettin ' now , an ' that 's all they 're int'rested in . i know exackly what pa 'd say . he 'd jus ' say it was n't none a his business .
dammit ! huh huh . that chick wants me .
aggghg ! we 're gon na die ! we 're all gon na die !
yeah , but come on ... all i get to do is cry and get insulted .
what are you talking about ? you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do . we got it down cold , al . you do n't want to jinx it by changing something up , do you ?
that could be quite a lethal weapon ... it could kill , not cure .
not in the hands of a great surgeon like dr. duval . the beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter .
how did you feel when i told you johnny boz had died -- that day at the beach .
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game .
you do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment .
that 's because dr. zaius realizes our work has value .
you made a terrible mistake , keegan . you did n't do what i said .
that 's right , you 're gon na do what i say . joey . i want to help you out of this .
you do n't have to show me anything , mr. rogers . i believe you .
i 'd rather mr. kane withdrew without having to get the story published . not that i care about him . but i 'd be better off that way - - and so would you , mrs. kane .
you do n't have to remember to be hungry .
it 's weird , but if you do n't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry . you get sort of shaky but you do n't realize you have n't eaten . have i told you about sammy jankis ?
well , could there be any position ... further down the trough ?
i 'm sorry , i ca n't do anything . he 's too incompetent . and the bottom line is , he can not be trusted .
no kidding . i 'll bet you have some very grateful clients . what 'd rex buy you ?
rex sent me two humidors full of pre- castro cubans .
the e-ringers ? full integration is gon na cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when congress is already swinging the axe .
congress cuts , military bleeds . but pentagon 's a big place . let 's narrow the sights .
look , sir . i 'm sorry to have troubled you . i think i ought to be going , sir . julian bars the way .
no , no my boy . no trouble at all . alex slowly sits .
lieutenant , self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems .
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating .
jessica ... listen to me ... listen to me ... the lifeclocks made me kill francis . they make people die or be killed every day . if i did n't try and destroy that ... i could n't live here or anywhere . do you understand ?
i want to be alive and with you , that 's all i want .
it 's me or wallace , jack . wallace 's third party is only going to help mcgovern . i need your support .
well , you sure been chock full of surprises so far , `` mister president . ''
i entered here , monsieur , at a bad moment for you ; it seems that you love this lady .
certainly , monseigneur , does not your excellency consider her worthy of love ?
i do n't know . he 's a hairdresser .
you suggested it , do n't you think it 's a good idea ?
i got a letter from the judge advocate 's office on you today , fella , you 're on your way out ... they should have kicked you out on that lillibridge case . now this is it today .
i 'm an attorney on trial before the bar . representing my client . my client , do you understand ? you open your mouth and you 're losing my case for me .
if i 'm sleeping with him , and i have n't said i am , then so what ?
so everything . that 's so what . so i begin to hate him . so i want to do him grave harm .
ronnie says we do n't need'em for another four days . ... s'there a problem ?
no . no ... pentagon says , army 's got'em , they got 'm in ... '' custody '' ...
at this hour ? i do n't think so .
oh come on . quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool .
i do n't know , i do n't care .
well , pardon me if i do . now who else ? who could 've leveraged a class officer like that ? c'mon , jordan , keep your head in the game .
what makes you so sure it 's wynant 's body ?
several things . hello , fred . we 're hungry again . yeah , and lots of onions . oh , and coffee .
but how 're you going to explain this ? how did you get him out of the pool ?
you are right . yes . we must put him back .
we need signatures . to overturn the ballot . i can supply those , oswald .
i could teach her my `` french flipper '' trick ...
i 'm afraid i ca n't offer you any real protection . i have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy .
i 'm sure i 'll be quite safe until the meeting .
then the department of justice owns % of bialystock and bloom .
oi . i 'm depressed . leo , do me a favor . open the safe . i want to see the money .
i just ca n't leave without first searching those islands , one by one .
but are n't you tired ? i can just about manage to stand on my feet ! raimondo !
the porter ... what 's his name ? old asbestos --
estes ! that 's exactly who it is . that old guy knows something . we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first .
you know , the rape , to ... even to the accident ...
you mean < u > with white < /u > ... ?
he and his love are like a retiarius . do you know what a retiarius is ?
he 's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and does n't wear anything but a jockstrap .
not here , perry 'll be calling at six to find out what 's happening .
`` what 's happening . '' oh , is that the understatement of the year . well , so . . . where do you want to . . . talk ?
hey , mr. executive . buy you a drink sailor ?
we have new `` guests '' for the park . i have a file on them . may i see bruce ?
do n't worry . i 'll get him soon enough --
listen to me . this time is different . there 's more at stake than ever before .
i do n't think so . it 's like a tv station . and they 're tuned into mine and no one else 's .
who is they ? is frank part of some larger group ?
that i was n't bullshitting you , sweetheart . at least you 'll know i 've been telling the truth .
look , i 'm not saying you do n't have a daughter . it 's just that she 's not my daughter .
nope . legal problems , you got ta have a good attorney .
my attorney , she 's just outta law school , about a couple of years older than my kid , for chrissake .
yes they are . and i 'm serious . do not fuck with me . i am going to get laid before i settle down on saturday . do you read me ?
sure , big guy . whatever you say . it 's your party . i 'm sorry i 'm in the way and dragging you down . maybe you 'd have a better time on your own . you take the car . i 'll catch the train back .
about the dumper , did n't he tell you that ?
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper .
or you could just wait a couple months . it 's not like the baby 's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls .
what to expect says that readying the baby 's room is an important process for women . it 's called `` nesting . ''
ahm . that thing i was doing tonight -- i 'm not doing it any more . i told them i had to spend the evening with britain 's premier equestrian journalist .
oh well , great . perfect . oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it 's my sister 's birthday -- shit -- we 're meant to be having dinner .
i 'm gon na do whatever i wan na do with it .
well , then , i 'm afraid i 'm gon na have to keep it .
i , i was asked to do this material - -
sure , because your new stuff 's a bunch of crap . kaufman , people are sick of you . the wrestling ... the hoaxes ...
who says anybody 's gon na be with us ? i say we go to the fights tomorrow , find out what the snoop 's big plan is , then go in ahead of those guys -- < u > alone < /u > .
let glenn deal with the snoop , while we 're off livin ' the good life .
please ! we 'll talk . just tell us what you expect .
goddammit , i expect to be treated like and artist . get off my screen ! !
i do n't have to tell you what that would do to our careers !
we 've got to stop him right here , now ! with that armored steam engine of his it 'll be a slaughter .
i got a picture here . i want you to tell me where to find this woman . i been asking everybody . nobody knows anything .
calm down , mister . you do n't want to get the cops in here do you ? you got a family ?
i need somebody respectable ... but not completely legit . what i 'm gon na do is n't very legal .
i 'm a banker , friend . that 's legit in this state .
oh , well , you know what i 've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff i was talking about .
still after that first million before you 're thirty .
i hardly know him . i saw him only once , some years ago . i ca n't even remember him .
in any case he 's asking you to come and stay with him .
better haul ass if we 're gon na be inside to greet them .
i 've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards .
look up , frank . full moon . the blood 's gon na run tonight . i can feel it . our mission : to save lives .
our mission is coffee , tom . a shot of the bull , puerto rican espresso .
then i better be on my way . do n't wan na put you out no more .
think it 'd be best if you stayed put while we talk .
well i was thinkin ' like , when bela played `` fu manchu . ''
that was karloff . paul , you got ta try harder . i do n't want this film to be haif-assed . this time , we go for the quality .
how 'd you know ? just tell me that . how 'd you fucking know ?
i knew the same way in ten years you 're going to know .
transmit the code emergency and take us offline . override the airlock sensors and hurry ! we 're running out of time , we have to get to the pods !
much as i 'd like to help you and our valued guests , i 'm afraid i ca n't .
that was a dumb move , herman -- a dumb move .
and then some . if you 'd only told us you was goin ' to her room we could 've kept 'em busy --
hey , eddie , looks like you really stepped in it this time .
what are you complaining about ? here 's your fifty bucks .
i guess you could say i was n't thinkin ' , captain .
says here you done real good in the war : silver star , bronze star , couple purple hearts . sergeant ! little time in stockades . come out the same way you went in : buck private .
not good enough , scotty . you 've got to do better !
i 'll try , sir . scott out . well now , he 's got himself in a bit of a snit , do n't he .
no one can say how the emperor 's thoughts work , ambassador , and unless we move quickly , he might change his mind again .
but , my dear duroc , how can i act without guidance from vienna ? i have n't the slightest idea of how the emperor francis might feel about this .
i 'm a qualified psychologist . i 've got a degree and everything . i believe that something happened here and i want to do something about it .
all right . what do you want to do ?
oh-jesus-mary-n-joseph , she 's pregnant ! if you are -- come back , sweetie . mommy wants to talk , then kill you !
annette , why do n't you just see if there 's any beer left in that can and relax a bit .
not at all . i enjoy the smell of a good cigar .
then you wo n't like this one . it 's a piece of shit .
those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks .
this seems a little sophisticated for them . these are not subtle guys .
why surely , mr. president , there must be some mistake . i mean ...
a mistake ? to assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the chattanooga river and single- handedly trapped jackson 's entire cavalry ? how is that a mistake ?
i swear , chauncey , between you and benjamin , i 've got my hands full ... ... say , that is coming along , the swelling has gone down considerably ... ... any pain here ?
yes , robert . but it 's not bad .
well , her people were very poor . she says she was often hungry as a child , and i 'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful , not a balanced diet at all .
exactly , and that 's why she could n't possibly have come from such a farm .
please , eddie , no 'fat lady sings '' shit .
i still sense some doubt in this group , we could turn it around . you 'll be up in the country ?
i do a very thorough background check . i go through police files , personel files , anything .
then how come matt and i showed up as guilty ?
well , let 's see now ... if it has my name on it , then i guess it 's mine .
oh , it sure has ... you know , you wrote your name in all my books , 'cause you knew this day was gon na come .
what 're you gon na do with morse code ?
... we put your guy in a < u > sweater < /u > ...
i 'm an old friend of cochrane 's ... i wanted to see how he was doing .
lucky for him you came by when you did . he might be dead now .
you 're so twitterpated you do n't even see the miner 's hat and the pickax .
you 're implying she 's , what , a gold digger ?
how come you never ask me any important questions ? do n't you wonder if there 's going to be a nuclear war ? or a cure for cancer ? what about your family ? what about people ?
i 'm curious , but i do n't want to know . jeez , i hope you have n't been telling people what 's going to happen to them .
it would 've happened years ago if you had n't carried him . why the loyalty , wendell ?
he helped me out once . that 's all .
< u > ten < /u > million . ten million in negotiable u.s. treasury certificates , in bearer form , coupons attached . and one more thing -- your personal assurance that job will be at the exchange .
done . bring it to me in london . i want it by the end of the week .
i have n't been on the job five minutes and already she 's making advances to me . not that i care -- but where is your husband ?
why - er -- my husband passed away ... i was with him to the very end .
i just need to use the phone , lady .
oh , let me get out of your way then .
protest finally forced `` amos and andy '' off the air . could stop us from ever getting on .
let'em try . i will kill to make this happen .
all right ! he did n't do it . all right ? now ... would you get the fuck off the phone ? i 'll bet that really changed them , huh ? anyway , leon ... did i do it for you ?
yeah ... huh , thank you . i 'm going to go back , sonny , to the hospital . they 're really nice people . they 're really trying to help me .
you still never know what 's going on in anyone 's mind ...
i ca n't believe it . whatever happened was an accident .
man . i 'm sorry . we just went for a walk --
i do n't really feel like talking about it . the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place .
you 're still with us though . you 're somewhere on the face of the earth ?
well , we 're not in the middle of nowhere , but we can see it from here .
will you go . andy , make them go .
you ca n't go out lecturing ? tough shit . women are dying . where can i lay this stuff out ?
that 's the craziest thing i ever heard . absolutely not .
robert , grace is n't adjusting to school . and she ca n't sit in this apartment all day ... i think it would be good for her .
they 'd be better off , but the cause would n't be .
how many men does cornwallis have under his command ?
affirmative , arctic warrior . please advise your salvage authority pending registry check . over .
roger , north island . arctic warrior over and out .
deanna , i 'm going to belt you right in the mouth !
these eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives .
easy morg , do n't think about that now .
is n't true . i ca n't see a damn thing .
but he 's got five times the man-power to draw on .
we can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer . henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for dr. oliver harmon jones .
hey , mr rothstein , it 'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house .
if we let her get a few of her things we 'll be out of your hair .
i got no idea of love . and neither have you . i mean , neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street .
i 'd know it , eddie . i 'd know . for god 's sakes , what are you trying to do to me ? i love you .
why ca n't you be his uncle and not his playmate ?
jesus christ . i get in a good mood . how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood , and then be in a good mood ?
it 's miss america , n'you 're bert parks .
... yoha , yoha ... yoha . < i > why < /i > albania ?
you 're the only human being i care for .
then do me a favor . if the world 's going to end , it should n't matter a bit . i want you to cure me .
i was just going to tell you that i love you . i said it .
i know . lloyd , let 's not start putting things on this level .
hmm ? i dunno . chafing from the backpack , something .
that 'd be up on your shoulder , maybe your lower back .
it probably will . in fact , i 'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will , in time . why should i settle for that ?
because it 's fair . give me next quarter . if you still feel this way , vote your shares ...
no , george , we 've already done that with lonnie . the blind one last year , remember ?
oh , of course . who can forget the emmy ? then let me bring betty to the set and see what happens .
at home . i could n't face all this traffic .
i 'd better come with you , then . are you sure you can drive ?
if we ivy leaguers are n't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies , at least we do n't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'chink . ' next thing i know , you 'll be calling me 'chief . '
chink 's the guy 's name , for christ 's sake .
you are the most desirable creature that ever walked .
if only brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me .
what 've i got to lose ? you okay , dolores ?
yeah ... they closed me down for a coupla weeks .
you are lying , you never lost that kid for < u > seconds < /u > , you could find him from a < u > coma < /u > , there is no way !
i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off . doing my imitation of you .
precisely . and then it came to me . my greatest ever plan . i made a deal with some minor league bad boys . arms dealers , renegades generals , you know the type . with you gone , we 'll make a fortune rearming the world .
you 'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains .
but , i did n't ask him to kill .
who would believe that ? and you know , someone else might recognize her . she was as well known as the castle rock .
... they have the capacity to meld into the < u > woods < /u > , and ...
and one of them is in love with the < u > sister < /u > of ...
it was n't enough that the whole world loves you , but you had to take away the last person on earth who did n't think i was a piece of shit .
no one thinks you 're a piece of shit , tommy .
hi , babe . come on . i 've got a couple of things i want to tell you .
what 're you doing out of uniform , sid ? you do n't want to get in trouble .
no , i do n't . you should 've left a long time ago .
we ca n't all get up and leave , can we ? i mean , there are certain needs you have to respond to ...
but he asked me to say ... on his behalf ... that your achievements have increased his ... admiration for you , and that he believes ... your success is predestined by heaven ... and that his army ...
my dear francis , you do seem extremely uncomfortable .
that 's crazy . you lost the frog in the subway and you blew our cover . if they have n't moved already they 're not gon na move now .
walter , i can make this case if the feds will get the hell out of my way .
that is correct , comrade skrapinov . we have ascertained that gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the american government .
big business . i could work with that faction quite nicely , colonel novogrod .
what can i do for you , mr. kirby ?
well sir , i am a great admirer of yours , and i have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss . would you let my wife and i take you to have dinner tonight ? our treat .
look , you do n't understand . i need a job . i 've got a kid and --
i understand and i 'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up ... . ... after the first of the year .
have you been camping ? you could use a scrub .
i 'm clean . smell me . i always smell good . i do n't know why , i just do !
they met at the empire state building , only they did n't . never mind .
what kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio ?
we loved it . we thought it was a masterpiece . that 's why we 're here . we want to produce it on broadway .
you 're not , as you americans say , dragging my leg , are you ?
still got the nose to the old grindstone , eh ? jane , i offered to let george in on the ground floor in plastics , and he turned me down cold .
oh , now , do n't rub it in .
we think you should give up the magazine . sell it . let someone else run it . whatever it takes .
we want you to go to college , find a career you love , marry a nice girl from a nice family , and live happily ever after .
maybe if you quit running around after other women you would n't have so much trouble with this one .
that 's a lie , lieutenant ... anybody that says that is a liar .
you is something , homeboy . my trouble is -- i ai n't had enough stuff yet , i ai n't et all the ribs i want and i sure ai n't had enough white tail yet .
how 's the rest of the gang ? you seen anyone ?
leonard , dutton , erlich . they do n't matter . i want the king .
we 're getting there . because in his so-called construction job , tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called `` the hole . ''
and where exactly does that put your position ... ?
i 'd have to say i do n't know enough to have one yet . for the moment i do n't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive .
if you like them , they 're for sale . another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block .
i 've read about the museum 's financial troubles .
would n't bet against her . tell you what i will do -- bet you i find that bracelet before we hit france . not a hundred , though -- just fifty .
it 's a bet -- come on , sally !
what are you talking about ? sugar and me , we 're just like sisters .
yeah ? well , i 'm your fairy godmother - and i 'm keeping an eye on you .
sure , he wants us to send mike to meet him to hear his proposition . the promise is the deal will be so good we ca n't refuse .
what about that tattaglias ? what will they do about bruno ?
it goes ; `` today is the first day of the rest of our lives . ''
however it goes , the point is , nobody says anything to anyone ever . right ? ... right ?
did n't much look like you were hanging drapes .
i swear to you that 's all that happened . i have n't so much as set foot in your bedroom .
she 's out there is n't she ? she 's in the lake .
okay . do n't ... you do n't understand what this is .
the disturbance in cyberspace ... it 's an a.i .
right . and no one would take on an a.i ... . if they had a choice .
mr. nygma , you 'll forgive me for being rude . but what exactly is on your mind ?
precisely . what 's on all our minds ? brainwaves . the future of wayne enterprises is brainwaves !
no , you 're right . or buddy . i wo n't ask if he 's with you or what you 're doing here in detroit . or if you 've run into glenn michaels yet .
do n't talk like that , okay ? you scare me .
oh , i got you . not too long .
then get a move on . childs , come with me .
is n't he that psycho who 's been spying on my sister ?
kara and danny never showed up tonight . we 'd better go home and check on them . there 's nothing else for us to do here .
that was amazing . thanks so much . you did n't have to do that .
that 's okay . i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it . i hate when people take advantage of tourists . it ruins it for the rest of us .
i do worry about susan . have you known her long ? she has n't mentioned you .
actually , we 've only just met . but we 're quiet good friends .
something happened . you got nuked in the last quarter .
yeah , my knee got folded about degrees the wrong way .
he wo n't get started ! i 'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours . i 've done it all my life ! i 'll blacken this punk until -- joe -- your job is back in the senate -- keep those men fighting him *there* .
i hit him from the floor with everything i knew !
not that . i mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy . maybe we should n't make love for awhile .
now do n't go overboard , i look incredibly hot , right ?
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you ...
the moon is too round of face , methinks .
that 's it . you 're not setting foot off this ship until we return home .
but i have n't even shown you my biology project ...
she really did n't do it for me , baby . how 'd you like dorothy ?
i do n't know . the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on . does that makes me some kind of fag ?
he 's going with me . you take crabtree . and his friend . all right ?
ail right . by the way , his friend ... ?
poor thing . does the ice help , rose ?
ohh-hh , a little . oh-h , i ai n't never been to no dentist before . he 's gon na kill me , i just know it .
the greatest . they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors . hey , easy on the punch bowl . budget only calls for three drinks per extra . fake the rest .
listen , artie , can i stick around here for a while ?
i do n't know . i just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office .
they have a right to know . howard is a thief . he steals the truth . i ca n't remember my baby ! i ca n't remember my baby . it existed and i ca n't even remember . do you understand that ?
oh , no , i ca n't let you get me that . that 's too much .
oh , oh , yes . i-i-i- 'd like to , uh , uh , very much .
oh , see , i meant someone you 've had sex with . that 's part of the theory .
excuse me for asking , but how would you know ?
that 's tony mccoy . he 's playing lieutenant dick craig .
oh really ? how much money did he put up ?
i 'm not going to rob you , mister . do i look like a thief ?
i do n't know what you look like , boy . as far as i can tell , you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night . you live in this town -- or on your way from here to there ?
it did n't go anywhere . but that 's not why --
about the dumper , did n't he tell you that ?
we know ! we got them last year . five minutes after the geneva man was gone , the blankets were gone .
one more thing , gentlemen . the kommandant told me to pick up the radio .
hello , scott . i 'm your father , dr. evil . i have a son ! i have a son ! everyone , i have a son ! someday , scott , this will all be yours .
i have n't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship ? i hate you !
but when it comes out , the public will be outraged . it will look like germany all over again .
is n't that what we want ? germany all over again ? only done right this time ...
car accident , gun shot , multiple stabbings , a hook through the back ... where did you find these kids ?
they are the survivors of the steveston county massacre .
look , i 'm a very nervous man . i got ta have a job where i come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one . and twice a year i got ta have a six month vacation .
i 've got just the job for you -- secretary of war .
and you do n't know your name or who you are , that right ?
i ... no , i ... i just ca n't ...
but , what if i go into labor ? that could happen any time .
i 've read up on it . i 'll deliver the baby myself if i have to .
if you 're here to fire me , your timing 's lousy .
i 'm not gon na fire you . i wanted to . but then you got sick , and that woulda made me look like a shit . you embarrassed me , erin .
is it true the most you 've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars ?
four hundred -- but that was a long time ago .
i 've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before . did n't know she owned one .
buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county . pilar looks away , struggling not to cry --
i would like to be your boyfriend , yes .
it 's just the shock of seeing me after three years . believe me , you 'll get over it .
as i recall , you 've robbed it before .
years ago , if memory serves . when does the exhibit end ?
well , i understand the problem about the supermarkets , but i was talking to this girl last night , and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset .
marty , see that my mother is nice and comfortable , eh ?
i ai n't so sure it 's a great idea , but that 's up to you . just do n't tell her where we are .
pardon me ? y'all got a phone here i can use ?
i see . she must have been very happy here .
too happy . that 's why i discharged her .
that 's why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place .
rick , do n't be a fool . take me into your confidence . you need a partner .
sabu , what the fuck you doing ? ai n't nobody gon na push on this street .
shit , i ai n't doing nothing . white bread asks for cocaine , i take his money . shit ... you know ... it was just a hustle .
more morphine , hurry up , come on , come on ...
hesitates . then drops his sulfa . fumbles in his pack . finds the morphine .
what ? who are you ? what do you want ?
my name is jennifer hillman . i 'm an archaeologist . i read in the paper about the murder yesterday and i thought i should come talk to you .
may we have this wolf 's name and address ?
these guys have no place . they change virtually everyday . and his name ... it 's a surname .
looks like you 're bailing out at the right time .
that 's why you get the big bucks , captain .
well ... how you feel all right about telling liz to put him down ...
i think we should . it 's not fair to let him suffer . he 's not much use anymore . he 'd hate living like that .
she pleases me . permit her to live in the world of the snakes .
now , i will talk ... to the wolf man ... and the mummy .
i know you . this shari is a passing fancy .
no ! i -- all right , look , if you hear from ray ... . tell him to call me , okay ?
like hell you will . you 'll buy me a cab .
why do all you dames have to live in the bronx ?
but i love you . i 'll love you forever .
i 'll love you , too , charlie . i 'll love you for twenty years .
let me guess ... bullets do n't hurt you .
they hurt ... but they do n't stop me !
just give me elvis and i 'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks .
i do n't ever wan na see another ice cream ...
you know what 's ridiculous ? your libretto , that 's what 's ridiculous . only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff !
oh yes ? and what 's so intelligent about writing a requiem ?
uh ... actually , it might be better if you read the story first . call me when you 're finished , okay ?
okay . i 'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow . it does n't seem to be too long .
and what if , just say , there was a kidnap attempt ?
you do your best . they wo n't be paying you enough to perform miracles .
it is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen .
the attacks are unceasing : by night , the dark ones ; by day , those of our people who have sold themselves to them , those traitors who are called the slayers .
... you keep pouring out that suppressing fire , barnes . i do n't wan na be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me ?
do n't tell me how to fight this fucking war , 'lias , you go crying to fucking brigade on your time . out here you belong to me . now move .
there always are . but there are also three men and three guns . matched forensically . a few loose ends do n't matter .
something 's wrong . i feel it inside . does n't that sound crazy ?
you 're judge right ? we need to talk .
i do n't know you and i got nothing to say to you .
hey , do n't knock masturbation ! it 's sex with someone i love .
we 're not having an affair . he 's married . he just happens to think i 'm neat .
skipper , you 're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is .
reticular fibers . we ought to be clear of them soon .
well , you 're sweet , but you do n't really love me .
yes , i do . please , rose , be a good sport .
me ? he ca n't . i 'm already disturbed .
he wo n't disturb us then . i think he 's after morphine . there 's a war . where you come from becomes important . and besides - we 're vulnerable here . i keep hearing noises in the night . voices .
leo , you 're my agent . tell `` them '' to take a flyin ' piss . i did n't do anything wrong . i fought in the war , for crissakes !
fought ? come on , pete , you ran the px at fort dix .
sue , i need some of that anger , rage , frustration --
i 'm sure i can come up with something .
everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about joey blow . when that news reporter gets home he 'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern .
i 'm lost . you do n't get enough attention , you get too much attention . which is it ? where are your shoes ?
jesus , she 's jammin ' . and she likes you . what else do you know about her ?
well , she does know a lot about wine .
thanks . coming from you that really means a lot to me .
i 'm a qualified psychologist . i 've got a degree and everything . i believe that something happened here and i want to do something about it .
an ' little bill killed ned for what i done ?
not on purpose . but he started hurtin ' him worse ... makin ' him tell stuff . first ned would n't say nothin ' ... but little bill hurt him so bad he said who you was ...
oklahoma city . jimmy 's gon na wire me some money , and then ...
you talked to him ? ! is he mad ? did you tell him ?
can you even imagine ? who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ?
well , i guess we 're not , since we do n't have dates .
i do n't know . it 's been a while .
i have n't been sick this year . i know that .
yeah . what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory ? six scoop interviews !
yeah - but that time we stole old lady haggerty 's stomach off the coroner 's physician . we proved she was poisoned though , did n't we ?
you 're such a ball-breaker sometimes . especially at night .
sorry . but after our days ... so if i try this thing ... if i ship out to coronado ... what happens here ?
no . no way . i would n't even know where to begin ! those thoughts about my cousin elena -- they were just thoughts . i would never --
c'mon , rufus , you 've been busted twice for felony hacking .
boy , you really know how to cut me down .
what ? you do n't , do n't be so sensitive . ca n't i say anything ?
why did he come out here ? what 's going on ?
beats me . he just asked me to come along , double-check the forensics . what did you do to piss him off ?
what if your girl 's theory turns out to be bullshit ? i mean , they could be in rio de janeiro .
i 've got to play it rough with them . if they know anything , i 'm gon na know it .
you got that on the brain , harry . if you 're so scared of 'em why 'd you take their money to vegas to begin with ?
because i need half a million to buy a script .
gillian ... would the whales be at sea by now ?
yes ... if you have a chart on board , i can show you .
you got ta go , r.l.. i ai n't foolin ' this time .
you sayin ' that gun 's for me if i do n't ?
a settlement completely demolished , ten smashed army jeeps , four dead arabs . g dash d damn it , hammer ! you think you 're above the ten commandments ? just find santa claus and bring him back to us . no heroics , got it ?
hey , it 's your bar mitzvah . i 'm just readin ' the torah portion .
she told me you said , `` mama , you want to kill me . ''
i never said ... oh look . that 's just a figure of speech . she said something funny , and i said ...
my life is meaningless as long as you 're alive . what am i while you exist ? a shadow ? an enigma ?
if your issues are with me ... this has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the federation .
pardon me ... my mistake . taking your thoughts in hand , huh ... ?
whoops ... do n't mind me . go ahead and finish up .
admiral , i 've been hoping to see you . maybe you can get through to those thick heads in starfleet that ...
why are n't the enterprise transporters in operation , mister scott ?
you did n't want my opinion in the first place , so why even ask ?
i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy .
would n't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find ?
and have them clomping about in my life ? oh dear , no ... at that time i still had certain private amusements of my own . how did you feel when you saw him , clarice ? may i call you clarice ?
yes . i would like to be on that show .
fine . they felt that since you had such close ties with the president , you would be a splendid choice . ... can i help you ? are you looking for something ?
what then sir ? what would we do with the park with out bruce ?
do you think the assistant , what 's his name ...
then , that being so , why is today special ? why have you come back to see me ? is it that new file they gave you ?
i do n't < u > think < /u > so .
not to worry . no signs of pathology in nancy 's eeg or pulse rate . i 'd guess what we 've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell .
it 's just made her think ... her dreams are real ...
lydia , i went to this great house tonight , this guy designed and built , you would have loved it .
oh , yeah ? i wish i had seen it .
see , it does n't add up . there are only ballots but people voted . two votes are missing . check the register .
he 's right . two people must have pocketed their ballots . usually it 's more .
i 've come to know you . you 're honest . i trust you .
what 'll you do when it all goes wrong ?
i do n't know , forum 's pretty hot tonight . it might be hard to get in , though .
do n't worry about me getting in . just tell me where it is .
case daddy do n't like me . what if he do n't like that i do n't got his color hair .
pace , your daddy 'd love you even if you did n't have no hair at all .
no ! like , ten years ago . in texas . baby ... jessica !
oh right , right ! she fell down , like a ...
no i do n't ... i keep asking because i feel fat .
oh g-d , i 'm sorry ... you 're not really fat ! i was just saying that because , uh , i thought that 's what you wanted me to say .
you 're kidding . it 's almost eleven- thirty !
i know . i 've been here since eleven .
what 's wrong , annie ? you 're not smiling .
i 'm never smiling again . paul dragged me into the boys ' locker room to tell me ...
no , that 's fine . what calls came in today ?
wait . that 's yesterday , from the other office . today is ...
this is janice the operator , who 's this ?
my name is barry egan and i spoke to you ... .you called me , you remember ?
it has to be , like a socially conscious theme .
'one that reflects the students ' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them . '
sorry , honey - he just happened to tag along .
nothing ever really changes , does it , david ?
he 's taking her to the land of death , right ? so all we 've got ta do is ... hitch a ride ! < i > < /i > stop shaking ! i 'll protect you .
oh , < u > sure < /u > . mr. action hero ! why could n't i be arnold schwarzenegger 's figment ?
there 's something wrong here . kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave .
i said i hope she 's a runaway . better that than she just disappears like so many others do . sometimes they turn up years later , sometimes not . a lot of crimes go unreported , unknown . these are realities .
claude , man , i 'm serious . give me those keys .
i ai n't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride .
janet . janet majors . it 's just that brad ... my husband ... is not ... very well and ... i do n't want to miss the next episode of dentonvale .
dentonvale ... say , that 's for ... i 'm sorry to hear that , janet . look i 'm going to let you through , but keep it to yourself , otherwise ...
what ? look , let me use the console for a few minutes .
you must be joking - when there 's a woman involved - there 's no stopping me . now , let me have that sheet .
they obviously have no sense of historical perspective either .
it 's not funny ! i mean what am i gon na do ? without that yearbook i 'm lost . i ca n't just walk around town looking for someone with a wilson high school letter sweater ! ! !
until we know what new influences are affecting him , we ca n't be sure .
in other words , we collectively do n't know shit .
witless and misleading . why do you think he takes their skins , officer starling ? thrill me with your wisdom .
it excites him . most serial killers keep some sort of trophies .
it 's not too bad . it 's a tragedy ! why does she have to be in love with a jerk ? !
all the good ones go for jerks , you know that . forget her . take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve .
marietta , i was just gon na leave and see if i could pick up their trail .
no , you wait right there for me ... i 'll be on the piedmont flight tomorrow at seven . meet me at the airport .
what 's he doing , honey ? is he getting any help ?
something 's happened . he is n't trying anymore .
it 's the influence of television . yeah , now marshall mcluhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high , uh , high intensity , you understand ? a hot medium ... as opposed to a ...
what i would n't give for a large sock o ' horse manure .
where 's where i asked him about being scared ? you should work on your speech .
no . it makes me nervous to think about it . let 's do this .
the glib , cavalier routine , it really is an act , is n't it ?
do n't believe it . i 'm just skin deep .
well , that 's a good question . strange as it may seem , charlie , i guess i write about people like you . the average working stiff . the common man .
well ai n't that a kick in the head !
you were running with the old ones . at the knee . heavy duty .
well , it was just a dream , i --
sure thing . put them here ... i 'll take them .
thanks ... i 'll ... go say hello to your mom .
i 'm going to live right here . as long as i have to .
but a morning newspaper , mr. kane . after all , we 're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
huh ? oh , come on , sis . i 'm tellin ' ya , we ca n't play clue with just two people .
why not ? i used to play it alone . i love murder games . have you ever played the consulting detective ?
honey , calm down now ... it 's okay ...
there 's a man . i woke up next to a man ...
jason ! ca n't you see ? he did this .
impossible ! he was dead before he entered cryo-statis . there is no possible way he could be alive .
he was n't going to let us use it , so i just took it .
oh , i wish we could just get in it and drive , and drive , and drive !
okay . great , martin , that 's just great . meaning to life ... mmm ... .
like , that there 's a point ? an organic connection between all living things .
what are you doing ? what 's wrong ? i told you we 've got a 4:30 .
you 're going to miss your train ! lou , meet me at adelaide . it 's above santa monica canyon ... yeah , soon as you can .
and the beauty of it is she 'll never have to know 'till i 've passed on . maybe she 'll think kindly of me -- - after i 'm gone .
gee , you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you .
you need me , selena . i 'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate .
i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower . now burn rubber .
i knew you would n't come if i did n't have a map .
that gripes my soul , man . we 're out here in the middle of nowhere . there is shit nibbling at my balls ! do n't tell me you do n't know where we 're going !
i 'm his pimp . he left with the dancers , did n't he ?
hey , you 're the psychic . eve , the psychic pimp . you tell me .
no . actually , i think that 's their technical name .
once the tests come back , is there someone i can reach in your office for the results ?
do you think i have it , dr. venkman ?
definitely . i think you may be a very gifted telepath .
just give me the money . fuckin ' give me the fuckin ' money , sammy .
i 'm gon na okay you ten and get you even , and that 's it . then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you .
good . you can do whatever you like with these .
eggiwegs . i would like to smash 'em . pick up th elot and f ... owww ... he slams his hand down and cries out with pain .
during the florida primary , you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child . you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls .
sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe -- -- off the record .
well , the sheriff found < u > two < /u > batteries in your well . if you left one with carl heine , how is that possible ?
i had a spare battery in my shed . i brought it down , and put it in just before the sheriff showed up .
sir , doctor hudson and i see a pattern develop ...
we know helen . she 's not exactly a credible collaborator . especially late in the day ...
do n't worry 'bout me . i always get paid .
yeah , then ya should take better care of your responsibilities .
where the hell do you think you 're going ?
business appointment . i 'm seeing my broker at three o'clock .
keep your change . bus three-twenty-three . leaves at seven fifty two , tonight .
i 'm sorry . it 's just ... you know ...
a miami social occasion ? mr. rafferty told me the cubans were from miami .
barker 's wife called me at three this morning ; her husband apparently had told her to call if he had n't called her by then .
it is my duty to see that he does n't impress the other half . rick , laszlo must never reach america . he stays in casablanca .
it 'll be interesting to see how he manages .
i saw her . julia . alive . i saw everything .
you might 've seen jimmy hoffa dancing with timothy leary . i do n't care .
hey , man , do n't ever call me that .
i call it like i see it , and what i see is definitely soft .
about an hour ago . in medical . i saw my son . he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were ...
is n't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge ?
is it the medicine that 's making you thirsty ?
truth is , i 've been thirsty my whole life . never really known why .
oh , um , like famous quotes . i find reading them inspirational to me . and in my reading i 've come across some i thought you might like , too .
oh . well , i 'd love to hear some .
louis , whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape ?
because , my dear ricky , i suspect that under that cynical shell you 're at heart a sentimentalist .
please , sylvia ! it 's a quarter to nine !
first you ca n't wait to get me up here , and now -- rush , rush , rush ! makes a person feel cheap .
the truth does n't mean anything to you , does it ?
danny , i 'm trying to -- save you .
i have an alternate version of the first chapter .
you 'll be all right then . look at carlyle , when he lost his luggage .
no , just a minute or two .. i knocked on your door - no one home , so i followed the music ..
i 'm sorry . i 'll get my things .
instead of worryin ' about reggie , you better worry about me ...
do n't give me this , we were partners .
yes . i said stop . i screamed . i mean that 's how it sounded in my head . he hurt me ...
that 's okay , kelly . you 're doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?
okay , we need wallpaper paste . hey cece !
oh , is there anything else you remember , how did you propose ? was it romantic ?
well , the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up . get you to kill the wrong guy .
yeah , well i go on facts , not recommendations , okay ?
i had a good time last night . i really did .
so i 'm going to get some sleep . i 'm glad you 're okay .
no ... i do n't think so , man .
be easy , sailor . there 's two employees . i take one in the back to open the safe , you keep the other'n covered ... you ai n't plannin ' on raisin ' a fam'ly in big tuna , are ya ?
i do n't know . where did you hear that name .
i overheard daddy mentioning her to someone . i he thinks she 's the killer .
no , i do n't admit it 's stupid .
you can have chicken with eggs but not with milk . why is that ?
okay ... let 's say that , for now .
it 's true , believe me . so ... do you know what i 've been doing , all alone , in my workshop , for almost two years ? ... mr. find-the-need-and-fill- it . how i spend my every solitary hour ?
i understand , sir . but you are an honored guest of the united states ...
he is already on the plane . i hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me .
there 's nothing in this hall . someone 's pulling your chain , as usual .
unless it 's a diversion . milo 's in my office . he was tailgating , so i --
definitely a package you do n't want to open or touch .
hope you find him . i love that dog .
we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did n't plan on straying into town .
no and i do n't plan on sticking around either . i do n't guess i 'll be seeing you again . take it easy .
i occasionally box with ricky at the harvard club . anyone else ?
and ... spencer wants to meet you for a drink at fluties pier .
you did n't ? -- i guess i forgot to tell you --
you 're a little ahead of yourself -- the usual routine would be for you to propose , and if i accept , then you 'd give me an engagement ring --
this does n't even have burt reynolds in it .
hey , neither did et ; but that was a great movie , right ?
i 'm gon na drop charges on the break-and-enter at hudson 's ...
you have no authority to make a deal like that . that ' s for the d.a ...
premier belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie .
mister president , are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this ?
did n't you hear me ? caitlin really is getting married .
which did you like better : jedi or the empire strikes back .
i can still feel its weight . if you could have felt it , not just seen it ...
well , that 's the general idea , my dear .
that -- or he 's out blazing trails . he 'll show up .
sure -- sure . he must have a compass with him .
i try just to be happy i 'm still alive .
you do n't look very happy to see me .
gee -- i 'm sorry about that , miss -- you *are* miss saunders , are n't you ?
yes , i 'm saunders -- and this is mr. moore -- a member of the press . meet the *senator* , mr. moore .
i want to see stew smith . oh excuse me - i mean mr. smith .
pardon me , mr. smith is engaged . we are having a reception here this evening
well , mom , he 's the first to admit it . he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice .
in a democracy , cathy , everyone is entitled to a fair trial . your brother 's practice ...
but i ... we do n't even know each other .
you have no reason to feel ashamed . you have n't said anything you do n't have a right to . and if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me .
that 's the best kind . a wise woman once said `` polite conversation is rarely either . ''
let me be the one to quote scripture . ... .as an agent of our organization , you are put in awkward situations . just remember , hudson hawk is an evil , evil man .
to be a `` piggy-backer '' it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature .
and rich people have none of those qualifications , i suppose .
that 's better than gold when it 's cold .
thank you . tell me -- what do those words mean ? `` beloved husband '' ... `` beloved son '' ... `` beloved wife '' ...
i hope to christ she does n't expect us to wear these things .
whatever it is just do it . the more we play along the faster we 'll get the hell out of here .
mrs. maclean -- why do n't you and daughter stay for dinner ?
oh uh , thank you . no , we do n't want to impose .
a lot of people think you 're a snitch . it 's dangerous ...
like i fucking care ? i 'm not just sitting here !
outrageous , merv . nice to be here . i feel great .
i was going to say ... your eyes look a little red .
the people i know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they 're interested in putting anarchy out of business .
all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .
well , that 's something never happened to me before , you can bet your bottom dollar . uh , where 's the matches , ma'am ?
top drawer . maybe if you did n't call me ma'am , things would work out better .
all right . now let 's get to bed .
wait a minute . wait a minute . so how did it happen ?
... jesus , barton , what the hell is this ? what 're we gon na do ?
i 've got ta call the police  or you could call for me 
i 'm sorry , captain - your message is breaking up .
bless you , sulu . where 's the peace conference ? they 're going to attempt another assassination .
tax-free booze . it 's about all you can say for army life .
where you from with that crazy way of talking ?
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car ? it does n't make any goddamn sense .
just settling an old score . you might say revenge .
oh that . that was an exercise to prove a point . about the evils of conformity .
john , the curriculum here is set . it 's proven . it works . if you question it , what 's to prevent them from doing the same ?
no . i do n't need to take this to be your friend .
yes you do , donna . what a downer you are ! ! !
'e.g . ' means 'for example ' , ray . i think what you wan na say is 'i.e . '
bullshit . e.g . is short for 'ergo ' .
i have misjudged you i think . i did not imagine you were so cruel .
you are not regarding it in full . the widow windsor had been run through by a sword . i followed the bloodless wound , a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes .
more like jenny is after every man she sees .
you pay toby no mind . he just likes to show off for his girl . give him a couple of hours , he 'll cool off . still want that beer ?
but the corridor outside this door is open , correct ?
yes . you can enjoy some wonderful views from there .
your vessel did destroy u.s.s . grissom . your men did kill kirk 's son . do you deny these events ?
we deny nothing ! we have the right to preserve our race !
how much you figure that 's worth , skipper ?
hard to say . maybe forty , fifty million .
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls . i was merely a spectator .
the point is kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
well , what have i got ? alimony to a pair of tramps ? they 're of no concern to me . it 's you who count , but do n't get me wrong - i do n't intend to let you break your neck again !
j.j. , you said you want to help me - prove it !
i 'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections --
-- i 've already run it . there 's no record of any living relative .
well , i think it 's good to keep all your options open . you can always enroll for the winter quarter . you could even live here and go to the city college part time , and still get a job if you wanted to .
look at me -- i 'm not even listening to a word you 're saying .
three of our classmates are dead . that 's not really the occasion for a party .
nobody wants to be the fourth . please go with me .
yes it is . will and seamus look at each other -
i do n't know what happened ... and i do n't know what you did ...
must it be so definite ? ca n't we just say that we will be married when i get back ?
where ? at the city hall ? no ! i want the whole wedding or we will have bad luck . for a whole wedding to be planned , a date must be set .
no , worse . he 's discouraged . at exactly ten-forty-five pm tonight , earth time , that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away god 's greatest gift .
oh , dear , dear ! his life ! then i 've only got an hour to dress . what are they wearing now ?
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety .
i 've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , edward valiant , are positively funereal !
you agree with a lot of what he says , do n't you .
i know where he 's coming from . the only thing i really do n't get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out , i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
thanks , beckett . i 'm real excited about it . what can i do for you ?
i was fired by wyant wheeler . i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners .
i do n't know ... i did ... feel different ... alive .
yeah , it 's a gift . you got ta do something with it .
the < u > late < /u > mister futterman ?
that means mister futterman is dead , by golly .
looks like we have some animal hairs in here . maybe some kind of a rodent .
so is that what all this is ? someone have a problem with us living here ?
going on right here . it 's a big night .
it 's just a run-of-the-mill monday . the calendar 's loaded with them .
well , at least i know what to name him . i do n't suppose you 'd know who the father is ? so i do n't tell him to get lost when i meet him .
john never said much about him . he dies . even before the war ...
when we went to the hard rock cafe . who paid ? when we went to see 'cats ' . who paid ?
those are n't presents . that 's normal friendship stuff
please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress . under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material ... mere chance has allowed me to array against you ...
monsieur le marquis , i am a soldier , not a diplomat . you called this parlay for a reason .
yo -- i ai n't mad . i 'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- they take cheap shots an ' paulie knows it .
... are you going to say anything to him ?
i 'm going to try and locate redbeard- i assume you 've heard of him .
every man who 's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him , the lions will be dead .
the only thing i regret is the day i met you .
well , if that 's the way it is ...
wait for the sucker to charge , then hit the switch . just like taking a picture .
the big picture ... if we ca n't get him to swallow it , we 'll shove it up his ... .
look , lester ... are you unhappy with me about something ?
yeah , i 'm unhappy with you about something .
good . that was good . where do i go ?
it 's a place called shaw 's siesta motel . the address is north east it 's under your name .
then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect eugene and isabella for as long as we can .
if only alex and i had done that with the others , alex might still be ...
why 'd you do it , frankie ? after all these years , why 'd you turn against him ?
i did n't turn against nobody ; he turned against me .
can you ascertain if there 's proloid in his system ?
not in a routine autopsy , but if we looked at the spinal fluid , there might be a high level of iodine , but it 's difficult to know . whatcha thinkin ' , jim ?
as soon as the men have good shelters i 'll move . perhaps martha will join me this winter .
there , then , you can have sort of a normal life .
meeks is probably in rio or someplace like that by now .
he 's under a tract house in san berdoo . and he do n't smell too good . what happened to the heroin , johnny ?
i never noticed before - that 's a cowboy tie ... .
i bought it for the square dance . i thought i ought to wear some- thing western .
he 's never going to come back . he 's gone off to be a soldier and mummy does n't even know .
it does n't matter , i can drive the car home .
heavens , no ! the owners do n't like us to even talk about it . i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight .
yes , sir . do n't worry . we handle this kind of thing all the time .
screw regulations ! four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there !
so , i do n't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down .
i was going to say - if you want to eat with us , ever you and lieutenant singh
very kind of you , we can always eat in the town with the others -
klute , the company 's interest is tom grunemann . solely and exclusively . you say you ca n't find tom ; all right , i 'll see that you 're paid off ; the case is closed .
all right , but i 'm going to see that list .
jake , i 'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense ?
honest to god , emmett , he would 've killed me .
i ca n't . the voice man is coming to get me .
no one 's coming to get you . not while i 'm around .
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there . so he climbs up . to cut it down .
just as the freighter comes through ? is n't that quite a coincidence ?
he 's not getting a phone , he does n't like talking on the phone .
oh , please . okay , so give me the zen master 's address , i 'll think of a reason to stop by .
uh , v.i.p . security arrangements generally take some time , senator .
`` security '' ? what the hell you talkin ' about ? your base is n't secure ?

that 's what i told you then . only he did n't . lednov killed him .
my god ... you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch .
she did have a miscarriage , did n't she ? did n't she ? !
beth . i did n't mean what i said . about --
yes you did . i 'm a big girl . i can handle it .
so this ... foam you found in the lungs . how does it get there ?
as i testified . it occurs when water , mucus and air are mixed by respiration . i believe i said that .
what ? you do n't , do n't be so sensitive . ca n't i say anything ?
tch , well , i sing ! for chrissake , hannah , you heard me sing !
potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun , sleep , sleep , my baby -- raccoon sits in the spruce all night , sleep , baby , sleep --
what in sugar hill 's the matter with him ?
and when they 're done laughin ' , they 're gon na call the cops . that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel !
angelo ? he 's a pal , a chum ...
that 'll happen when you 're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin ...
someone 's gon na have to nurse him through this .
people can not be taken away , madame , neither a hundred and sixty million nor one . not if you have their love . you had n't . that 's why you 're not in russia any longer , and that 's why you came here this morning .
very interesting , my dear , but could n't you write all that from moscow ? a dissertation on love on soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox .
- so i watched europe . once you showed up in england..it was easy .
you knew i liked the rentals at liverpool street .
it 's really a stupid opinion . you have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak .
because my opinion threatens yours , it 's poorly developed ?
i want a fucking lawyer , man . i want bill kunstler .
what are you , some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties ?
it 's starting to grow on me . but what do the 'b ' and 'p ' mean ?
the fountain is the caspian sea and the sea is serving up caviar . the 'b 's for beluga , the 'p ' for petrossian . of course , they also stand for 'bill ' and for 'parrish ' .
i do n't want to be in any competition ... i dive because i like to , not to beat a record ... do n't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him ?
no . all you need is to want to be the best .
okay , whose window did bud break when he was playing with his father 's golf clubs ?
easy . mr. jenkins . what job did mr. jenkins have ?
you 're forgetting the check for your suitcase . it 's at the grand central .
oh , yes -- yes -- that 's right --
they say it 's fantastic . at least that 's what i read in a men 's magazine . so who are the two lucky ones ?
me and the muse , of course . how is your book coming along ?
why , you sweet thing , you . where 'd you get it pressed ?
listen , brati 'm going to count to ten . if you 're not out of bed by then i 'm going to yank you out myself .
i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back .
oh dear ! but then where did the motorcyclists come from ?
... stan , i 'm thinkin ' we should offer 'em half a million .
now come on here , no way , wade ! no way !
would you shhh ! mary 's gon na hear us .
just relax , dear . now , um ... what exactly are we looking at here ?
all this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named dewitt ! she apologized , did n't she ?
on her knees , i have no doubt ! very touching , very academy-of-dramatic arts !
it 's our secret . honest . how can you be so mean to someone so meaningless ?
i must protect my interests , ms. kyle . and interest number one , is < u > moi < /u > .
if you 're for real , you 're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone . does n't include touring and guest lectures . when can you get them here ?
i 'll reset our course . . . hours ?
i 've been doing some thinking . it 's my last school year . i 'm a single , successful guy . i think i want my freedom .
why ? because she wo n't sleep with you ?
i do n't mean to denigrate your misspent youth , lex , but what does that rock have to do with --
tune me in , lady . an explosion such as the one superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the krypton rock .
we have to go after them , find where -- !
alexander , i know you 're trying to help . but they do n't come back .
you ca n't pre-empt yoga , that 's our biggest show .
brian ! you wan na be a big deal , do n't you ? that 's your dream in life .
i was born near here . but after my mother died , my dad moved . i grew up out in rossmore park .
you 're pretty black to be growing up in rossmore park .
i ca n't work in a vacuum . why do n't you make hendricks chief ? his family 's been here since the puritans -- half this island are his cousins .
martin , we hired the best man we could find .
that 's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning , 'cause there 's a spider in the bathroom ?
my god , i mean , you know how i am about insects .
hey , miles , i heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me .
oh , yeah . no . i mean yeah , i stopped by for a drink . did n't see you .
i do n't know if i can . but you have this ... and you know where to come .
you mean you 'll , like ' dig your way out of the grave ? euww .
if we ca n't stay in the rex 's territory , we have to move tonight .

he 's so great , < u > you < /u > hire him .
well , uh , if i could i would ...
is this a punishment for something we did in life ? what can we do ?
i do n't know if there 's anything we can do .
i was , yeah , i was thinking about going there for business --
-- well , if you 're gon na go --
i thought perhaps as vice-president , and in view of the unfortunate attendance 's for the summer show this year ... the massive financial loss ...
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... yes . great news . fabulous . triumphant . course it might need a little smoothing over . when 's he due ?
quite a little shopping spree . how do you spend six figures in less than six hours ? oh , never mind i 've seen it before . i 've seen everything .
do you think he set me up ? do you think that was his intention ?
captain ... all systems have failed ... we are functioning on reserve power only .
we 're out of control -- rig for collision ...
no ! please ! shut up , will you ? we 're trying to think here . it is sort of like being a puppeteer . i like that about it .
no one would ever have to know its not him .
hey , man , if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu , i 'd tell her to go fuck herself . why ca n't she board it ?
first of all , dude , you do n't have an ex , secondly , it 's a fucking show dog with fucking papers . you ca n't board it . it gets upset , its hair falls out .
i 'm wondering about the weather department . i 'm wonderin ' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments ?
i can check on that for you , maybe we can take a tour --
cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house , and you know that saying , if you ca n't beat 'em , join 'em , well if she 's one of them , she wo n't be as scared .
you know what i think ? i think vada 's very lucky to have a friend like you .
i wish they 'd quit writing this shit about me .
that 's good . at least they 're interested .
< u > did < /u > you want to be killed by it ?
you think i 'm < u > that < /u > nuts ?
why do n't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings -- who < u > cares < /u > ?
because it means the tree is older than the house .
... no . i never saw him with anyone else .
so . you talked to mundt , what about ?
i mean , mr. green was so nice to me . he took me in and ...
i do n't really know what you 're talking about .
yes , he has some hard bark on him .
that do n't hardly say it . he shoots the desk clerk one day , and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel .
sorry , pal . i 'll fix you up , call you a doc , but i ai n't gon na walk into a bunch of knives for ya .
how bout you ? i 'll give you the whole hundred !
were you badly hurt ? i think we saw each other at the hospital . i do n't want the car . in fact , i was appalled to find that i have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped .
can i give you a lift ? i somehow find myself driving again .
well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so . lord wessex was looking at you tonight .
all the men at court are without poetry . if they look at me they see my father 's fortune . i will have poetry in my life . and adventure . and love . love above all .
it 's alright . if you want to go home ...
no , i want to stay with you guys . but i ca n't . i mean i 'm not ready .
victim my ass ! you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage ! maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved !
this is what i deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists ?
do n't worry about coming up with anything . it 's cool .
such a sweet boy . but after much thought and careful consideration , i 've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be ... me .
at the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool .
mama mia . just because you were a nerd once does n't mean it 's going to happen again . that 's why you have me for fashion consultation .
the ring ? ... he was brought to us as is , baron . i ...
you killed the doctor too soon , you fool !
reed 's disaster . you know , i half- think he did this to me on purpose .
sir , i 'm sure he would n't put himself --
make a blind here ? wait for the buck to return ?
if the nest is upwind , so are we . when he comes back , he 'll know we 're here before we have a chance . the truck --
no . she tink lobo is waste of my time . lobo do n't talk .
but tor , it 's a starring part ! you 're second billed .
he paid the hospital bill when you were born . your mom always calls you `` our beautiful daughter '' in the letters she wrote to him .
from the first time i saw you at school -- all those years we were married to other people i always felt like we were connected .
well , i 'll tell you one thing , old man , she never looked at me the way she 's looking at you .
i might have , walter , but you were never there .
for heaven 's sake , bob , what 's the matter with you ? you went out there for the purpose of
george . george - do you mind ? i 'm sorry , but i ca n't talk about it tonight .
i wan na go trick-or-treating like the other kids .
but i thought you did n't want to go trick-or-treating .
you 'd cosmetically alter simone to look like me ?
no , of course not , you 're right . that would be crazy .
do n't like the feel of it , jack .
it 's your own fear troubles you ... we 're here , are n't we ? for all the dark magic protecting it .
put it away , will . it 's not worth getting beat again .
you did n't beat me . you ignored the rule of engagement . in a fair fight , i 'd kill you .
my holds are bursting with swag . that bit of shine matters to me ... why ?
because it 's what you 're searching for . you 've been searching for it for years . i recognize this ship . i saw it eight years ago , when we made the crossing from england .
crash , i get wet just thinking about you .
i thought you wanted an `` uncomplicated '' boy ?
what 's all the rush ? you said three o'clock .
he 's leaving early . after this `` set '' . he 'll be out in a couple of minutes ...
that had nothing to do with the world . not this one , anyway .
on the contrary . it has everything to do with the world . and our dreams of how it will succumb to us . you enjoyed the girl ?
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
my name is john . now i 'm not a stranger anymore . see how easy it is for us to get to know each other , beautiful ?
because i never tried to suck my own dick ?
no , because you wo n't admit to it . as if a guy 's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself . you 're as curious as the rest of us , pal . you 've tried it .
on the square , jimmy , if you 'd seen winton down there -- i 'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he 's a dirty pup , but he 's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
great ! ... if he 's worthless we 'll give him away as a bridge prize . come on -- beat it . it 's five o'clock . you need some sleep .
i 've been with someone for quite some time , and did n't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly . but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids i might add -- she moved in last month .
since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids , he 's now living with a woman half his age --
what makes you so sure he 's the one ?
just for laughs we raided wonder boy 's house . there was a gallon of one of the corpse 's blood in his carpet . i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year .
and me too , son ! you shore done got to be such a big little man !
we goin ' huntin ' again , daddy ! ?
up to there ? really ? i bet i could beat that .
ha ha ! yeah right , white boy ! ha ha ha . i think maybe i drank too much .
mr. spock , rura penthe 's deep in klingon territory . if we 're discovered ...
quite right , mr. chekov . what is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity . before the captain and doctor mccoy freeze to death .
here 's what you 're going to do . you 're going to open up your backpack , take out your bag of money , count out five thousand dollars , and hand it over to auggie .
what are you talking about ? you ca n't be serious .
... the disciplines : bondage , domination and humiliation .
i 'm looking for tod . is he in ?
i 'll do it ! by god , i 'll do it !
this is where we belong , leo . on top of the world . top of the world !
i never forget anything , dickhead . that building was a sweep-and- clear ; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition . it got a little rowdy ... end of story .
rowdy . let me fill in some gaps for you .
i was special . the only colored kid in class . i became a sort of mascot . like a pink poodle .
i did n't know then that i was a nigger .
you 're saying that i 've halo 'd innocent people ?
i 'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might , just might , have an alternate future .
it 's the only name i 've got . how about you ?
no cat and mouse -- you 've got me . what do you want to know ?
but she 'll have no one to look after her !
her parents wo n't be going overseas now . . . they 'll have to cancel their trip . do n't worry about juliet .
it is a car afire . but wendell said there was something back country too .
when is the county gon na start payin ' a rental on my horse .
both jobs are open , hildy . the paper -- and being mrs. walter burns .
thanks , walter , but it 's no good . we tried it .
no , it is not something i 've heard about you ! it is someth -- why ? is there something i should have heard about you ?
why do n't you tell me what 's on your mind ?
if i let everything that should worry me , worry me , i 'd be dead from worry .
what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you ?
i want to stand for what i believe in , father .
then you must find out what your beliefs are .
you 'd love to prove that . getting your name in the national geographic .
larry , we can re-open the beaches in august .
yes , but listen . the illusion is easily explained . the eye retains each image , till they combine . and yet , some would call this toy magic .
do n't you see why ? look closely a moment . put your intellect aside . ca n't you see what is inexplicable ?
what is it you intend to do to me ?
let 's just say , god works too slowly .
well , do n't ever start up on 'em , cause once you do you ca n't stop . i tell myself i 'm gon na play just three little games after breakfast , and here i sit with half the day gone .
you mind if i ask a few questions about your husband ? roderick ?
can i help you look for the space man ? can i ? i know what he looks like ! he 's got a square head -- and , three great big eyes !
that 's enough , bobby . i think it 's time you went to bed .
rose , sit down in that chair and be quiet ! we 're trying to help you , you silly creature , sit in that chair !
oh-hh , ohh-hh , lord , he 's gon na kill me .
i thought you 'd be happy for me . after all , you --
bobo is n't after you ! bobo 's after me , and he 's goddamn good ! but so am i. i 'm a survivor , roy . i survive .
what is on your mind ? why did you hide ?
hide ? ca n't a fellow have a drink ?
first of all , what they did was totally unconstitutional . we 're already on the list to be heard before the supreme court of the united states later this year .
these guys back home do n't give a fuck about the supreme court and any of this bullshit ! they want things to quiet down . they want you to walk away from -
she 's got a hidden pitbull . maybe she hired someone to kill them .
she 's not a suspect . what is her motive ? there 's nothing , nothing connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys .
fine . what 's , uh , what 's on your mind ?
heard you got remarried ! congratulations . did n't think you had the stomach for another go-round .
... so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people ?
it was my finger that pulled the trigger , but i 'm not morally responsible . my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of . how could i know . i 'm not a doctor .
de < u > ceased < /u > . i do n't know where it came from .
look at the publisher . handbook for the recently deceased press .
ah ! you sly rogue , i see that will influence you .
the place seems more a farm than an inn-yard .
what 's the matter , do n't you want to hear our singing ?
oh ... well , yes , of course ; it 's just we 're looking for the horn resounding and --
he was a teacher , kind of a know it all ... always had this little smile .
geez , i do n't think i 've ever seen him smile .
you ca n't duck this , bill . i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i wo n't let this happen .
for the last time , i have no idea what you 're talking about --
now , baby , that 's got nothin ' to do with you . i just carry that . you been listenin ' to them cops too much .
the cops did n't try and strangle my ass .
i 've tried to stay out of it . but it turns out that 's not so easy , sam . you 've gone and got yourself this lawyer . mitchell stephens . you and risa and wendell and the ottos .
so ? i mean , lot 's of folks have got lawyers .
it always amazes me , lil , how you can whip up a hot , hearty meal out of thin air .
i can thank you for that . it was a hard-earned talent .
yesterday morning you called the president a traitor . what do you think that crowd is doing down there ? they think you murdered him .
because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the `` enquirer '' in his pocket ?
huh ? ... eh ... no , there is n't
because i 'm the one who called the police , you know .
we 're not doing it ! i 'm not even sure it 's christian .
maybe it 's an italian thing . their mother was italian .
they 're gon na give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal 's off !
i dunno what to say to you sweetheart , it is what it is .
and then with jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars . or maybe two-thousand . or twenty-thousand . who 's to stop you ? not jake mckenna , 'cause old jake would be dead .
that 's not the reason i 'm here . i swear it .
it 's the ship . the ship 's making you think this way .
i know a little bit about human nature and what i 've seen only confirms that .
this is the talk of a man ... if he were your husband ... he would never put you at risk . he would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you .
and if i were in the comoros , in the indian ocean , where would you be ... ?
well nothing audible to us . maybe the lab can pick something up .
damn ! martin i 'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that . i thought maybe it would help . booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- earl immediately plays up to martin , clearly relieved --
roger , north island . please advise pending further information . over .
affirmative , arctic warrior . this is united states coast guard north island station . over and out .
you really want to do this , do n't you ?
i do n't want you to get involved , really , i mean , i do , but if something went wrong i mean , like you said , they may be involved in murder .
hmmm ... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album . you 're not trying to soften me up , are you ?
no -- i 'm cleaning an attic . i would n't attempt the impossible .
why , how now , kinsman ! wherefore storm you so ?
uncle , this is that villain romeo , a montague , our foe .
ha ha . that 's too much , georgie . those days are over . the rate is one-thousand dollars . inflation , you know ?
this is a one time thing , gusto . one and i 'm out . give me a good price for old time 's sake . what do you think ?
what do you know about it ? i sleep where i want .
you best leave that quilt alone . that was grandma 's quilt .
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to ? what is it , bob ? !
let 's settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us .
if at some later date the message proves harmless , we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world , but until then --
that 's terrific , but there 's one problem : we do n't have the means to receive all the data on our own .
you do n't just casually walk out of a vegas casino with a dead woman .
we can do this . we can get her out of here .
i want to make things up to you . that 's why i got you this gig , doll . hawk , my name 's george kaplan and to quote the late , great karen carpenter , `` we 've only just begun . ''
three minutes , twenty-three seconds . if you think i 'm doing another ...
where is your cousin clark , by the way ?
he 's off doing a top secret uh , investigation .
i 'm free to do what i want ? and you think i would want to go with you some place on a plane ? where ? where ya going ?
i got ta jet coming here and we 're gon na try to get the fuck outta this thing . and we 're gon na go , man !
oh , they 're here . i 'm keeping much better records now , hannah . see ?
carl , it 's a jungle . i suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles . you 'd give a stranger the shirt off your back -- except it would n't be paid for .
he 's ... he 's dead . you do n't have to look for him anymore . he was eaten by a praying mantis .
it 's a shame he died prematurely ... i was hoping to kill him myself .
ingenious costume . let me guess ... trust-fund goody-goody ?
course you 're feeling fine ... you almost made a monster the mayor of gotham city .
i 'll rig up something do n't worry - do you think i could bash through with that little hammer ?
i do n't know doug , we have n't even got the place together and already you want to extend it .
but here 's the funniest part of it all . i was the fella up there doing the marrying . you know , the justice of the peace or something . . .
you were ? i thought you were chasing me ?
oh my god ! do n't do that ... feel my heart . go ahead . i 'm dying here ...
and what do you want , my little rat-with-wings ?
something 's in there . those flowers have been taken up , and put back again .
it could be -- the knife , and the saw .
i hope that j.j. really likes steve , that it is n't an act .
why should he put on an act ? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do !
certainly not . with all that unrest in the world , i do n't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve .
i quite agree . tell me , who runs up that flat - your wife ?
you 're terrible crude sometimes , sailor , you know ?
i ca n't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them mores in your mouth .
the girl is looking to party , and you tell her we 're going to go back to our motel room and crash ? jesus , miles !
well , i 'm tired . are n't you tired ?
you 're a real honest to goodness < u > good < /u > guy .
i 'm self-centered , i 'm weak - i do n't have the will power of a < u > fly < /u > on shit ...
that 's what i mean ... always looked like you was just knocked out in love ... was real nice to see .
i 'll tell ya though , it 's comin ' up to the time when marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down ... i think that time 's comin ' up right soon . but like you said , everythin 's relative .
even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?
but that could 've happened to him . or to me , if i 'd been alive . or you .
as a matter of fact , you came home without any clothes . you were in your - uh - shorts . yes , sir .
oh , do n't be silly , walter . i could n't walk around in the streets without any clothes . i 'd be arrested .
there is n't that much - you did n't even taste it - what 's wrong - do n't you like my tea ?
it 's not that - i just do n't want any sugar
thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly . i 'll give you som antibiotic cream --

in the middle ? we 'll only miss the titles . they 're in swedish .
you here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness ?
this one 's a story , but i 'm not going to tell you what it is . every time i tell you anything it goes haywire .
do n't ask me -- i 'm only the widow . if charles had died in bed we would n't even have him .
at least he knows how to behave at funerals .
just a moment ago ... did n't you hear the sound of a motor ?
at this time of the year there are so many boats ...
what ? what the hell 're you talking about .
i saw him . just a minute ago . some guy .
so , he 's playing hard ball . well , two can play that game . go after him . stop at nothing . you hear me ?
what ? i 'm sorry , sir , i ca n't hear you .
this ! meeting you in secret so we can be ... secretive ! you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and ... i wish you would n't even come .

uh ... attention , attention ! we 're looking for that chick with the big boobs .
heh heh . we wan na do her now !
well ... let me tell you , i 'm not luke . i know who i am now , and you do n't . and ... i do n't like me very much .
you know , it 's going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete . pete . pete . it 's a nice name .
sorry , mrs. chambers . i hate bothering you ...

i do n't know man . i do n't know . that reminds me . another little donation from the police .
if the pigs only knew they were subsidizing the panthers ...
go ? there 's a potload of money here , pal . you got three major toy companies ... you got the guys from burger god over here ...
burger god . the ones that found the pig hair in the french fries ?
now and then . mostly just for the fun of it .
i tried it once . i lost my shirt .
you 'll tell him i talked you out of jumping , right ? just keep me outta prison .
i ... i 'll do the best i can , bernie .
the ship 's good as finished . we 'll have to get out on our own ! is there a quick way out ?
we could follow the optic nerve to the corner of the eye .
um ... i 'm pretty sure i 'm bruce wayne . and you are ?
nygma . edward nygma . you hired me . personally . just like i tell everyone . well , we 've never actually met , but your name was on the hire slip .
she said you were legendary . i wrote a theme about you , and she said , `` your father is a legendary hero out of the golden age of heroes . ''
that 's nice . you thank her for me . go to bed and get lots of sleep , and then you thank her in the morning .
a couple days ; that 's all i 'm askin ' . i can stay clear that long .
christ , they 'll probably miss you and hit me .
pearl-handled automatic , uh ? no , it 's a belgian gun ... mm .
correct , inspector . a woman 's gun . u.s. caliber ammunition in it . it was on a table in there .
he says ... he says i must be good ... and help everyone ... and take care of myself . do you think he 's coming from the sky ?
perhaps ... but wherever he comes from , i think you should listen to him , because it sounds like he 's giving you very good advice .
maybe there 's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place , ever think of that ?
the only thing wrong is the cheap , softcore crap you 're peddling , eddie . where do you get this stuff ?
is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ?
i do n't mean who you 're thinking . i have other friends ...
easy , pal ! i was coming to congratulate you . it ai n't easy snatching one of those e-tickets . steve here was the last guy to pull it off , and that musta been , what , years ago ... ?
why 'd you do it ? what 'd i ever do to you ? ! ?
oh ! -- it 's -- it 's -- oh , it 's a house of ill- repute !
it is , thomas , but of good reputation . come , there is no harm in a drink .
of course it is ! are you doubting me ?
not in the least , madame . but you see , it 's a very expensive bag -- one has to be careful .
keller , black lion squadron . i knew him at pensacola . he 's damn good .
is there anybody in the navy you do n't know ?
i fucked up , frankie . i fucked up good this time . should have never started with this fuckin ' broad .
take it easy . what could you do ? i mean , she threw herself at you , right ?
that 's what this is all about ? a shakedown ? you picked the wrong people . we do n't have any money .
sure you do . everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house . it 's a wonder the mrs. here just now got round to killing him . not for lack of trying .
i need the `` when '' and the `` where . ''
i do n't know , okay ? all i know is butch cassidy 's back in town .
if she was sitting here , then it 's facing the wrong way . what are these smears in the blood ?
it looks like she was flailing , trying to get away .
thank you for taking the time to help us with this , dr. frock .
happy to be useful . it 's rare enough these days . according to security , beauregard put the whittlesley crates in storage area .
you know , courtney , you should take some more lithium . or have a diet coke . some caffeine might get you out of this slump .
i just want to have a child . just ... two ... perfect ... children ...
i do n't think i can give absolution to a man who 's about to commit suicide . it 's a mortal sin .
what is , red , the intention or the act ?
i 'm talking to you as a friend now . do n't ruin your life , your career for her . she 'll spit you out when this is over .
you do n't know what you 're talking about .
yes , he 's filled his head with notions seemingly .
the old mixer , come on we 'll have to put him right .
they 're like some kind of tribe . got their own language . you ca n't just walk up to these guys . you 've got to get out there . learn some moves . get into their head . pick up the speech .
angelo , this stuff is for little rubber people who do n't shave yet .
buffy , do n't ... do n't start thinking of me as your friend . it interferes with the work , and it ...
and it makes it worse when i die , right ?
i do n't think so . is my assistant taken care of ?
i put her in the guest room , just down the hall .
alot like . you know , i noticed it before , but i did n't ...
shutup , ted . you did n't notice shit . keep hammering .
shoot , it 's got ta be in the millions , maybe more .
three fuckin ' jackpots in twenty minutes ? why did n't you pull the machines ? why did n't you call me ?
i know it 's you , grady , i just ... christ , grady , do you know what time it is ?
i have ... eight-fifteen . that 's not right , is it ?
you 're saying the bombing was a cover-up . of what ?
i do n't know . but i have a hunch what you 're going to find here is n't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced .
thank you , hank . we 're on it . what were you doing out at sidney 's tonight ?
i just wanted to see her , that 's all .
nothing 's changed . then again , something has changed , has n't it ?
things worked out . i made some money over there , had some laughs , you know . it was good .
i know you would , ma . but i ai n't gon na let you . you hide somebody that 's kilt a man an ' ... an ' you 'd be in trouble too .
awright , tommy . what you figger you gon na do ?
do n't whisper it . do n't even think it
how long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle ! waiting for -- !
i need you to tell me what you remember . what happened to us ?
you went out the window . she was beaten and raped . she died in the hospital .
wow . that 's a place i 've always wanted to go . is it true the mountains are so tall you ca n't see the tops ?
not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit . that 's been my experience anyway .
fine ! do n't put yourself out . i 'll go to the land of death alone .
stu , you have my < u > absolute confidence < /u > . ­- dead man ! dead man walking ! !
& lt ; & lt ; it is longer than that . and not so dark . & gt ; & gt ;
& lt ; & lt ; are you sure ? & gt ; & gt ;
it 's gon na be bigger than big . think europe . think asia . they do n't have room for real golf courses in japan .
not for me . miniature golf 's for pansies .
of course . they would like you to appear on the show tonight . the vice president was scheduled , but he had to cancel , and they asked if you would be interested .
yes . i would like to be on that show .
why do n't you go'on and ask her . she need to talk wit somebody with sense . folks been ruttin ' and beatin ' on this gal all her days . and this is how i 'm handling it .
this is how you handling it ? this is how you handling it ?
no , no jokes , i got ta pee . just tell me about your day . what went on back there ?
well , come to think of it , we did have a big event around here . beth started talking .
come on , frederico , do you really have to go back ? at least stick around for the festival of the madonna .
i do n't think so . come back with me to rome . there 's this great new club . have some drinks , lotta ladies ...
that 's too easy . one minute you want to die , the next you want to live ... do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you do n't want it anymore ?
no , no ... i 'm just so tired , and lost , and ... i did n't realize what i was doing !
honey , i do n't think this is really relevant to ...
... and one day , this sweet girl calls me , asks me to lunch . just a shoulder to cry on deal . one thing leads to another and before i know it --
what i heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck .
i heard that one myself , bob . hell , i even thought i was dead til i found out it was just i was in nebraska . who 's your friend ?
i breached protocol . i broke contact with the s.a.c . i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device .
agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building . that you wanted to go back .
you are not so sure that he 'll come .
oh yes -- i am -- want to bet ?
i do n't like it when you use the word impossible ; nothing is impossible ...
mike , it would be like trying to kill the president ; there 's no way we can get to him .
you 're right . we should sit in silence .
we 're in the middle of a murder case --
what , are you nuts ? that 's oprah talking .
everything felt right for the first time . i need to go back to make sure , then if the feeling is still there . i 'm going to speak to dr. feldman about sexual reassignment surgery .
i think you 'll find it is in your interest .
hold on . ok. look willie , it 's plank outside asking for you , he says it 's in our interest .
i would n't have called the boy exactly balanced ...
alan was not ... unbalanced when i married him . and he was not ... 'indifferent to women ' no matter what they said ! hunsecker i 'm not fighting with you , puss ...
i would n't worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark - and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father -
and his 'egghead ' son ! we 'll give 'em a < u > rough < /u > < u > reception < /u > , wo n't we ?
your first lie to me , clarice . how sad . tell me - do you think crawford wants you , sexually ? true , he 's much older , but - do you think he visualizes ... scenarios , exchanges ... ? fucking you ?
that does n't interest me , doctor . and it 's the sort of thing miggs would ask .
leland leave her alone ... she does n't like that . stop it .
how do you know what she does n't like ?
we just need about six weeks , in about six weeks we could cut a whole album .
i do n't know , this is strange to me , you know .
what kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say ?
no , i 'm actually writing for the pictures now 
he is an impostor . theres no davidov at miratom .
heres your imposter . hes paid off the men on the plane outside . theyre not taking the bomb to any russian facility , theyre flying it wherever he tells them .
that girl ? no , never saw her . i do n't know anybody .
i 'm just trying to find ... who owns this store ?
well , i -- it 's just -- i do n't know , a user , i mean ... users wrote us . a user even wrote you ...
now get this straight , pal -- no one user wrote me . i 'm worth a couple million of their man-years ! i 'm bigger than all those little wimps put together ! humans they ca n't even keen their social order in one piece
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down .
be brave . he 'll come back - with or without gas .
come on -- i 'll promote a card game , and we 'll be sitting pretty .
until then -- the dollar forty stays with me .
i 've always thought of myself ... as a man of science . that 's what 's wrong with it .
then ... you 're in a state of conflict , jeff .
jeet kune do ... now i did some research on that form of fighting , and i found out that jeet kune do was a style developed by bruce lee . did you know that ?
yes , i did . that 's why tim studied it . because it was bruce lee 's fighting style .
yeah , least you could do is return my phone calls , though .
listen ... nicky ... we talked about this ... and , uh , i explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss .
you 'll need these . tonight . for the play .
do n't make me sit through one of your plays .
oh no , you 're pretty young . your body 'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think ...
no . [ beat ] i mean i found out while i was in it that my body 's gon na be found in four days .
it 's never happened before . what makes you think it 's happening now ?
you better be keeping your mind on business . it 's not just me you got to worry about . i 've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder .
... thank you ... and how are you this evening , doctor ? no , we know that you 're awake ...
good evening , dr. lechter . thank you for coming . i am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances .
dennis-right , uh , uh ... local kid probably , would meetcha in front of the movie house on saturday night .
oh , god , you should 've seen what i looked like then .
technology in the wilderness . only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip .
i 've got an idea . we 'll have to work fast .
but i guess we have n't really met -- have we ?
i 've got a lot of respect for you too . for the way you feel about your family .
how is that helping , natalie ? how exactly ?
look , if you 're going to be like that ... you should be appreciative that i 'm interested .
i 'll stay , if it 'll ease your mind .
you sure ? you 'll be alright by yourself ?
you know what . how long since we 've seen each other ?
let 's see . i was in reno six weeks -- then bermuda ... oh , about four months , i guess . seems like yesterday to me .
my clothes , your clothes . what does it matter ?
i would like to know the contents . every detail is important .
i think they 're more interested in my epididymis .
i do n't even want to know where that is .
i do n't watch tv and i hate books . whatta you need ?
does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you ?
you shit . who do you think you are ?
i 'm jp monroe , you stupid little bitch . now get the fuck out of my life .
trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today ?
hey bret . christ , my head feels like a split coconut .
well i just bought it , now i 'm fixing it up .
this is one big house for one single person .
fat lou , bring the ship to the following coordinates . call grendel , have them power up the labs , we 're bringing in the find of the century !
now wait a minute ! i do n't think you should open that door .
you should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find . what 'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough ?
nah , some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend .
i know it 's soon to talk about it .
oh , now , pop , i could n't . i could n't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office .
are you asking me for a `` date '' ?
why not ? you 're a good-looking girl . and i 'm -- - available .
i thought it was an accident . smoking in bed .
it was no suicide . it was not an accident . it was freddy , and he 's coming back for seconds , thirds , and fourths .
i know . i said that , but ... he said it was something he really felt like doing .
gee , um ... i ... i do n't know what to say .
oh , i 'm sorry . how 'd your folks take it ?
i have n't heard an official `` no '' yet .
adlai 's too weak ! we have to convince jack to pull him , get mccloy in there .
you ca n't take him out this late in the game .
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a princeton student . he gave them a recipe for potato chip dip .
it has to be a book the tooth fairy would know lecktor has in his cell .
for fuck 's sake , who else would it be ? the witching hour 's arrived ; you 've alerted the others , yes ?
i 'm no longer a man ! i awoke to discover i 'd turned into a sparrow !
here . i 'll turn down the air conditioner .
it 's not the air conditioner that 's making me cold . nothing moves in here . not even your birds .
time for a champion . can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird 's nests , jack ?
i 'll do what i have to do , for princess lili 's sake !
suppose you 've had all you can of sierra . what with that ruckus you had with toby . oh yes , i heard all about that .
sheriff , he did n't give me any choice . if i had n't defended myself- -
it was part of the treatment i intended ... i did n't know what the effects would be ...
so , what , you guinea pig sick people to find out ?
sweetheart , it 's a bore out there ... let 's lock the door .
holy christ . you want to get us killed ?
that 's the beauty of it . there 's only one tiny window of time when this will work . at the handover of hong kong -- from britain to china . the handover from them to us .
you 're out of your mind . we ca n't do a job like this with no rehearsal .
so she did n't mention anything more about it ?
no - she is n't in any trouble is she ?
you want to tell me what i 'm looking for ?
i 've only been invited to her house once , but i know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research .
... so you knew all this and yet y --
-- we needed cohesion to move forward . not conjecture .
we 've lived a dream together . a dream of freedom !
your dreams are n't about freedom ! they 're about marion ! you have to be a hero , because you think she sees you ! is that it ?
why do n't we go in ? get another crack at him tomorrow .
we got a barrel on him . we ca n't lose him . we stay out here until we find him .
you mean our past as in me and sid . this has nothing to do with you gale .
this has everything to do with me dewey . i was the one who brought the nation 's attention to this shit anyway . i 'll be damned if i 'm gon na sit around and pass on the buck again .
have a seat . i wracking my brain over this malkovich thing .
we saw his show at the luxor last night .
get what ? are you accusing me of cheating ?
good god , no . but with skill like that , what do you want a job for ? you do n't need to work .
is that supposed to be funny ? i 'm not laughing . i 've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent , funny boy . and ar the last minute i get bumped by you , some reject from the ozzfest .
why do n't you show me some gear before you get hurt .
kay , um ... how , uh , fast does this thing actually go ... ?
let 's see ... that was second gear..kay shifts into third . jay winces .
we do n't have time to argue about it !
are you crazy ? has the altitude shrunk your brain , gabe ?
rose . folks get sick . but you do what you can to get on the mend . our marriage ... it just got sick . that 's all .
talk to me about sick . ai n't been right since i moved into that drafty house .
they always let me do anything . i do n't want to pay for it . i never paid for it in my life .
just do what i say , okay ? we 'll pay for the girls and have a good time ... do n't you trust me ?
four hundred ! do you want to bankrupt this administration ?
i 'm getting them for twelve dollars a night .
no but he got really weird . like i 've never seen him act . really angry and super uptight .
i 've never heard of her . maybe something else was on his mind .
ay , ay , a scratch , a scratch . ay , a scratch , a scratch . ha ha ha .
courage man , the hurt can not be much .
oh , it was n't all that bad , darling . we were fortunate that mr. gardiner turned out to be so reasonable .
reasonable ? good , i 'd like to meet a reasonable man . why do n't you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner ?
you are very kind , madame de beauharnais . do you have some sherry , perhaps ?
yes , of course . hortense , darling , will you tell louise to bring some sherry ?
there are a lot of things i want to talk to you about . things i 've been thinking about -- changes i want to make .
i think it 's too late for changes , michael . i promised myself i would n't talk about it and i 've gone and spoiled it .
hey , who cared about me yesterday , huh ? nobody -- i think i 'm gon na train myself .
without havin ' good people around , ya wo n't have such a good chance .
this is how you 're spending my time ? having a sock hop ?
everyone know ray calitri ? pillar of the community ...
you ca n't run away from the planet , miss science . you ca n't even run away from the island , heh heh .
leave me alone , you ... cocksucker ! ! !
look jim . far be it from me to tell you what to do , but there 's --
are you going to preach now ? are we going to have a sermon ?
yeah , just like the half dozen guys you screwed today .
actually , it was two . you 're different , officer white . you 're the first man in five years who did n't tell me i look like veronica lake inside of a minute .
but that 's not the point ! what if all these things are somehow connected ?
oh , baloney . you should just hear yourself talk !
but why did n't he just follow her to fiji ?
because his mother got sick - very sick . he could n't leave her . he 's a kind boy , maybe too kind .
listen ... do n't you worry about ed . he 'll come around . he 's too good a sheriff to let you give him the slip .
i 'm just too old for going steady , josh .
the ones that 've been raising the devil with my fishing boats .
probably herring gulls . they arrive in november , you know , and do n't migrate north again until march or ...
they 'll be back . he had to go in for a urinalysis .
would you care for a drink while you 're waiting ? i can put it on the underhill bill .
no , actually , she was referred to me . she was dr. hagman 's patient ...
do n't equivocate . be positive . just tell the truth .
there are the people of the united states , and they are blaming you - oh , i know it does n't make any sense , but at least you can learn a lesson from it .
what lesson ? not to expose fraud when i see it ? not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property ? run it the way i said , reilly - `` this afternoon a great man was assassinated - ''
oh , but doctor . the music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- that 's life --
life ! -- mr. kringelein , you are drunk -- good night .
yeah , i mean slacks ... and work clothes ... and that awful car --
it 's a perfectly good car . it runs .
if he runs , everyone will assume he took the money .
you 'll be clean and we 'll be rich .
billy ! i 'm gettin ' a vision ! you 're the next one ...
hey , man , why 'd you say that ? !
come on , alex , let 's just get to alex 's . your bar 's the only place that 's going to cheer me . god , i 'd kill for a damn cappuccino . what the hell 's a nintendo ?
oh man , you still got a thing for those unmasculine european coffees ? who 's your buddy ?
music , of course . to get a sweetheart , one has to look around , but to get a radio , all you have to do is buy one .
ah , no ... for me , love comes first . i 'm a man , and i know what 's what : first love , and then music .
i 'm the kind of man likes to know who 's buying their drinks , lloyd .
it 's not a matter that concerns you , mr. torrance - at least not at this point .
but the emperor of china had of them ! how can that be ?
in the west , it 's one wife for one husband , but different cultures have different rules .
she was wearing a white dress with a cute , black hat -- and carrying a bag with s. m. on it . funny -- her name 's not on the passenger list .
maybe she 's in the show -- one of the troupers -- did you ever think of that ?
he 's right . we would n't have started it .
they must have clobbered some of our cities already !
i added air conditioning , put in the pool , made all those pillows by hand ...
yeah ? i should learn to do stuff like that . they make the place feel real homey .
it would be truer to say , i think , that a lot of people in high places knew me .
you were real close to all of them , to adolf , to hermann , to joseph , to baldur , and now albert , so , let 's hear the truth , let 's come clean . what was your party number ?
why stop with just one aspect of marine life ? why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer ? ...
well , if they were perfecting an aquaman , then why 's there a dead one onboard that russian ship ? why is n't he out swimming around ?
the attacks are unceasing : by night , the dark ones ; by day , those of our people who have sold themselves to them , those traitors who are called the slayers .
it is the way of all invaders . those they would conquer they divide , buying allies with promises of land and power .
take it easy . i only asked because maybe i could , you know , let you have a little something .
yeah , well thanks , but i got enough to hold me . my mother can send me some . i do n't know .
okay , this is what we 're gon na do . renata , cover up any memory he has of us or rekall .
i 'll do what i can . it 's getting messy in there .
oh , lots of reasons , most of them boring . but , up until i dropped out , john and i were ... very much alike .
that 's hard to believe . the two of you seem so different .
*go* anywhere ? of course not ! that would be *doing* something , would n't it ? we would n't want to *do* something . let 's just sit here all night !
if you 're trying to be funny , homer ...
my lord mother man , you look like hell . what were you drinking ?
the captain almost fired me tonight . i 'm on my way out . anytime now .
no-gah-buh- no ! rule number two - no names ! no goddamn names , you retard !
oh for chrissakes ... `` white trash betty . '' i did n't realize the rules went into effect before we entered safeway .
of course they 're gon na lose . we 'll watch them lose . what good is heartbreak if we do n't experience it firsthand ?
the red sox are your problem . i never understood about you and the red sox . everybody rooted for the yankees .
no . i 'm the best that 's ever threatened you .
i 'll meet you on one condition - i get exclusivity and you surrender to me .
oh no ! there is nothing ! i have everything , you have given me everything i could possibly want . i am happy every hour of the day . i only wish there was something i could give to you .
please john , it would give me so much pleasure to give you something . something just for yourself . is n't there something you would like to have ?
sean , come on out , man . what , you forget your favorite uncle ?
stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident .
ah ... sun tan lotion . any shops nearby ?
must be . trubshaw 's busy . i 'll send mother ...
send him packing . i 'm not walking all the way over there .
consider him packed . i did n't like his attitude ... struttin around with a cane and shit .
this ... ... this is what my life has become . stuff in boxes . stuff underground . is that so appealing to you ?
yeah , i guess ... is this my fault ? is vanessa mad at you because of me ?
well , for the same reasons we do , sir . do n't you see ?
no , major , i do n't . they have no regard for human life . they would n't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won .
-- she did n't know what she was talking about --
it 's ... .whatever ... .that 's not cool .
oh , nothing -- only i wondered why you suspected him .
well , i 'll tell you -- we picked him up about a year ago -- but could never pin anything on him .
how are you ? sorry . is your book going well ?
yes -- i 'm on a good streak , thanks .
bill 's in love with margo channing . he 's fought with her , worked with her , loved her ... but ten years from now - margo channing will have ceased to exist . and what 's left will be ... what ?
margo . bill is all of eight years younger than you .
i do n't really forget the sign , it just does n't seem ... any use . this used to be the main highway . want to register , please ?
sit down . i do n't want to trouble you , just want to ask ...
you 've heard enough . decide . are you going to release me ?
i 'm afraid that 's not up to me .
pendergast ! help ! it 's right behind us !
this door 's locked . try shooting the hinges off .
well , then . you 'll need excellent recommendations from your professors , a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your lsats .
i once had to judge a theta chi tighty- whitey contest . trust me -- i can handle anything .
how the fuck do you think ? the cops shot him .
oh this is bad , this is so bad . is it bad ?
oh , we get along okay . she 's just very ... she 's an extrovert . i think she 's loud . she probably would n't agree . definitely would n't agree .
are you going to see elizabeth while you 're here ?
in case you 're wondering , i like women , not little boys . and i 'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights .
i can take care of myself . do n't worry .
edie , listen to me ! i want you to believe me . i want to be with you .
how can you be with charley and johnny friendly and still be with me ? either way it 's a lie . it 's like there were two different people inside of you . you 've got to be one or the other .
< u > what do you want < /u > ?
wendell , i want you to come to work for me .
well , freud was right . so you think they came for the fag man , huh ? and what do you base this upon ?
he was the only one done right . two in the back of the head .
pardonnez-moi , i can not tell vat is `` like me '' .
an angel is like you , kate , and you are like an angel .
i did n't know he had a wine cellar .
guess that 's why he hid it there . let 's go .
you say a fortune . he never spoke to me of any rich relatives .
he hardly knew of them him- self . i believe it was his uncle in australia .
that 's it , parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living !
well , i < u > am < /u > living , are n't i ?
i do n't know if you read the papers , but that case is closed .
i 'm tying up loose ends . padding my report . you know how it goes .
do you know why he 's called buffalo bill ? tell me . the newspapers wo n't say .
i 'll tell you if you 'll look at this form . it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide . they said ... this one likes to skin his humps .
do n't cut me off . this is an emergency .
sir , the president does not call this particular number . so whoever you are get a life , before i have this call traced .
why ? ? i ... i attend every year .
yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to tm . but we feel that perhaps ... you and the program have grown apart philosophically .
gee , alan 's been looking kind of sick lately . is he all right ?
i ca n't discuss another patient . you know that . well , i ca n't find anything wrong with you .
no one -- she just died -- she slipped away , that 's all .
she slipped away ? she slipped away ? she did n't just slip away . you did it . you did it . you did it . you did it . you murdered my misery .
she 's visiting relatives in florida . now his boss , this guy gustafson , he 's also disappeared . nobody at his office knows where he is .
geez . looks like this thing goes higher than we thought . you call his home ?
maybe . and maybe they 'd at least be talking to us ! now tell your 'partner ' to stay out of it , or so help me if he lives through this i 'll put him behind bars myself !
he 's alone , tired , hunted , and has n't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you 're going to do to him ? robinson , wake up and smell the shit you 're shoveling !
no , ma . you do n't have to worry about that .
thank god . i -- i do n't want no mean son
i do n't know . i once asked dr. maxwell the same question . he said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken .
she hated sleep . she used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life , an hour at a time ...
lucky thing , my running into you . just the man i need .
you 're not making any mistake , believe you me .
we 're gon na disassemble his spiffy old batmobile , then reassemble it as an h-bomb on wheels . capiche ? yesterday 's victor is tomorrow 's vapor .
he 'd have more power as a martyr . no , to destroy batman we must first turn him into what he hates most . meaning , us .
the captain almost fired me tonight . i 'm on my way out . anytime now .
nobody gets fired . look at me . only thing they might do is transfer you to the bronx . you look like you aged ten years since i rode with you last .
it 's better when you pay ... they let you do anything .
they always let me do anything . i do n't want to pay for it . i never paid for it in my life .
sure , sure . you 've got a nose , gallagher . you 've got a nose . but there 's different women , gallagher . you know , like brewery horses and thoroughbreds .
on now , stew , do n't be too hard on her . i would n't call her a brewery horse .
i 'm the ebay boy , remember ? i ca n't exactly afford that kind of equipment .
who do you know who can ? where do we go ?
what about the gravimetric distortions ? they 'll tear us apart .
risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair .
i wish they 'd stop that . it makes me fidgety . do you think they 'll find him , nick ? he must be in new york ... . where do you think you 're going ?
i 'm going to take asta for a walk .
i am mad at you ! and at landon ! and the universe ! and god ! i do n't even know where to put all my anger .
that 's normal . god accepts your anger . he wo n't punish you .
that 's not all , frances . mr. bebe is very concerned about your politics . he hears you 've been donating money , speaking at rallies .
yup . claire ... please , please tell mr. bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life , we 'd make a lot better movies .
no -- no -- not yet . well , i must n't let it interfere with my duty . any news here ?
news ? yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four .
i do n't know , i ca n't say --
c'mon ! the guy 's working with you . you always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
jefferson airplane . `` white rabbit . '' i want a rising sound .
you 're doomed . i 'm leaving here in two hours and then they 're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps . right there in that tub .
if you 've got `` a broad '' available i 'll take her .
like you 'd know what to do with one .
his legend grows ! it will be worse than before !
you let wallace escape your whole army . you can not blame me for this .
that 's typical of your daughter . takes those things for granted . why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami for the love of it ?
please understand me . when i say she did n't tell me anything about it , i mean not until a little while ago . she thinks you 're entitled to anything you can get .
no -- but i 'm sure it 'll be all right with walter .
but , gee , hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
are you dictating my position to me ? we 're getting into some sticky legal territories here .
martha , all we 're saying is , no-one wants this to come to trial , not the church , not the crown ... least of all me .
i love her , bill . she is all that i ever wanted , and i 've never wanted for anything because i 've never wanted anything before , if you can understand .
how perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you . it 's not love --
you took a big chance , leaving this here all this time .
not really . i figured ganz was put down for a long time . and i knew luther would never job me on his own . he 's too chickenshit .
commander , if one of their weapons hits that gas ...
it 's our only way out of here , mister nara .
i 'm on the side of our mother holy church . besides , a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt .
well find some other way ! be creative . tell them she fucks the devil ... hmm , not a bad idea ... why ca n't you say that ? sounds good to me ... and who can prove she does n't ?
i want you to settle these troubles with the rosato brothers .
i was just going to contact you , michael ; we just had a 'sit-down ' - in fact , i just come from there .
thanks , but we have a terrific woman in on thursdays .
say , is n't that dr. barrington , the world- renowned agronomist ?
i mean walter owns the sox , cable sports ... most girls in her spot would be angling to get daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t ...
she would never . never . even think of that .
praetor shinzon . were not here to discuss your lack of a social life .
yes , i 'm sorry , captain . there 's so much we have to talk about .
i got ta figure a way to get across that goddamn border . longer we fuck around el paso our lives ai n't worth a shit .
look , fuck the border . let 's just dig in and wait for things to cool down .
ricky , you 're becoming quite human . i suppose we have to thank you for that , mademoiselle .
ilsa , i do n't wish to be the one to say it , but it 's late .
you said that ? and what did he say ? did he say you could leave her ? did he say we 'd be happy ?
he said that if i got a divorce i 'd burn in hell . for all eternity .
no one thinks you 're a piece of shit , tommy .
right , evan . i believe you just said `` sick fuck . ''
still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively .
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , max . what is it like these days ?
jesus , open your eyes ! seagrave , cosgrove , and now holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise !
holcomb ? i did n't know the name of that victim had even been released yet .
... you-my point is , you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks ? - i mean , you give us half the ransom , forty thousand , you keep half . it 's like robbing peter to play paul , it does n't make any -
okay , it 's - see , it 's not me payin ' the ransom . the thing is , my wife , she 's wealthy - her dad , he 's real well off . now , i 'm in a bit of trouble -
why , thank you ! very nice to have met you , cliff ! may i ask you a question ?
he 's a former boyfriend . we lived together for about six months . and yes , i 'll admit it . i 've still kind of got a thing for him . that 's what you wanted to know , is n't it ?
salazar 's been taken down . he was working for porfirio madrigal .
what ? i thought madrigal was dead . i thought it was verified .
what about ten o'clock , is that too late ? i do n't get off and then --
oh sure yes , that 's fine , late dinners are good . should i get dressed up or -- ?
he 's great . come on , let 's blow before lo ' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast .
oh , well , that 's just it . she 's been coming down here , every half hour or so , to , sort of , check on me . if i 'm not here , she might ... call the police or ... something .
all right , y'all gon na go with me ?
naw , hell , let them stay here with me and do men things . there might be some kind of ball game on we can watch . you go on .
well , the doctor says he 's showing some movement . it 's still early , it might mean nothing , but i thought you 'd want to know .
i knew . i sensed it when i heard your voice .
i 'm not like wes . wes was crazy .
and you ; you 've got it all together .
lois , i 've got to hand it to you . you 're amazing . who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that 's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the caribbean ?
i just knew i was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me .
naturally we 're very curious to know where it is you come from .
from another planet . let 's just say that we 're neighbors .
i have no intension of being nasty , mr. mitchell .
in that case , there 's someone here i 'd like to introduce to you . over there .
christian reformed . it 's a dutch calvinist denomination .
do they believe in reincarnation ? i believe in reincarnation .
come on , daddy , pull my coat . what happens if you give all that up ? you get sick or somethin ' ? i pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft .
i 'm telling you god 's words , not no hustle . i 'm talking the words of elijah , the black man 's god . i 'm telling you , boy , that god is black .
boat has two batteries . lose one you run off the other til morning . carl musta lost both , so miyamoto there gave him one a his .
course , if carl lost both batteries , dead in the water , his radio would n't work . so how would he signal for help ?
i 'm not so sure dr. loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger .
forgive me , but you do n't strike me as the social secretary type .
just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again . no harm admitting i fell in love with the sound of you .
that 's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living . i must 've had thirty regulars salivating at per minute .
frank loves you . you know that ... but i 've spoken to him and he feels that -- -- as a businessman , with limited resources ...
i 'll be able to keep my apartment and studio , wo n't i ? ... just tell me .
yeah . nice touch . it 's the logo from `` you bet your life '' , right ?
good eye . not one club owner got it . they all ask me why i got donald duck on my card .
because , sir , you are the only one of his victims who lived . and because you have large resources .
large resources , starling , which i prefer to devote elsewhere ... .
i thought you might write again . now that we 're brothers ...
i ca n't , how can i , in all decency ? we 've had a good run , have n't we ?
give him credit -- -the boy 's gall is gorgeous !
why do n't we hear what susie has to say ?
ha-ha-ha . i 'm serious , you smoke too much of that shit . that shit robs you of your ambition .
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv .
what ? when did it happen ? your dad and i always expected you two to get married .
yeah , i know peggy sue gets married . case closed . period . mom , if you could live your life over again , would you do the same thing ? get married and settle down after high school ?
`` music for old people . '' what does that mean ?
look , i 'm sorry about this , but i 'd like `` the upsetter '' by lee `` scratch '' perry , in there . instead of `` sin city . ''
i do n't think so . you probably should n't either .
no , but i 'm goddamn thirsty . ice water ?
for the last time . i may suborn women into illicit activities , but they 're handsomely compensated , i treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect .
is the veronica lake look-alike one of your whores ?
hal , i 've told you about twenty times , yes , i could identify 'em , but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this .
well , you 're not exactly an expert witness , but what makes you so sure ?
shoot him , nicky . not that we really mean it . but where does he live ?
keep going west . last building before the river .
... come on sport , you got ta try harder , i need some exercise for chrissake ...
mr. gekko , i do n't think i can ... go on .
uh , look ... why do n't you just take the car ...
... and you promise you 'll never tell anybody about this , right ? get in the fucking car .
- and you felt just like that talking to addison .
in a way . you find yourself trying to say what you mean , but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you 're not saying what you mean , but what he means-
every day of your life you 'll want me . you 'll never get over it . every time you see your face in the mirror --
shut up ! cut it out ! even if i have to kill both of us --
thank you for calling central services . i am sorry , due -
yes , but . i 've got to have a heating engineer
there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in . jack and i can get off safely . both of us .
i 'll be alright . hurry up so we can get going ... we got our own boat to catch .
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries . i treasure them . as you should .
oh yes , yes , yes , yes , yes ! always the same stale answers ! there is no god of mercy , father . just a god of torture .
you 've got the wrong jones , mister donovan . why do n't you try my father ?
we already have . your father is the man who 's disappeared .
no , you 're not . go ahead and take your time .
i do eat slow as a bird , whereas bobby can put it away like a speed swing ... is there any ketchup around ?
like you said , mr. deckard , a machine can be a hazard . the voight-kampff scale is a machine , is n't it ?
one that relies on human interpretation . where 's the subject ?
i want to ask you a big favor , gordon . please drop the bluestar deal .
now tell me , why would i want to do that ?
then what 's the rush ? you 're chasing that girl , why do n't you just admit it ? i 'm at the mercy of your sex glands !
do n't you have something better to do than follow me around all night ?
not according to my charts . do you have an appointment ?
look , i need to see him . i know where his room is . just give me a pass . i wo n't be long . ten minutes .
fortunately , i am to be married . with your highness , permission .
vlad , stop acting this way ! you 're my friend !
this is a japanese company , you know ? they figure a married woman , she 's on the way out the door ...
sure . it 's unnerving . i remember this one particular married woman , she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash ... i mean , talk about your wind chill factor ...
three in the morning ? i do n't think so . i have to go to bed early . i work days . it must have been somebody else .
no . it was you . you had some manila folders and a pink bag from saks .
but for wes -- it must be a temptation to him .
i 've no sympathy with people who ca n't resist temptation .
their faces are familiar -- but not to each other .
now that that 's settled , why not make the game a foursome ?
i have never seen such a stone . will you please tell me where it came from ?
that 's what i wanted you to tell me .
bend over and drop your pants , mr. babar .
oh really , there 's no need to -- we do n't want to do that ...
i 've been going over and over my experience last night . it was amazing . i 've decided i 'm a transsexual . is n't that the craziest thing ?
what , are you nuts ? that 's oprah talking .
heidi - why did n't you come down here ?
jesus - what - i 'm afraid - i 'm gon na get shot or whatever . you oughta see it on tv , the guns , the cops , they got cannon , machine guns , they 're loaded with gear .
i had n't thought of that . and then the swifts came .
it makes you feel as if they 're ... they 're waiting or ... resting ... or ... .
client got delivery . but there were ... '' extras '' in the back of the truck .
`` extras '' tried to relieve us of your weight ... and by the by , you know of a player in overtown who goes by the name of `` things aquatic '' ?
you said yourself , you thought about takin ' him out .
then . that time has passed . right now , mr. blonde is the only one i completely trust . he 's too fuckin ' homicidal to be workin ' with the cops .
oh . who 's in it ? i know what it is . it 's what 's on instead of the movie .
i just want to see the basketball scores . it 's important .
it 's just the way things are , kiddo .
well , i would like to sit in front today .
if the other side ever gets hold of a thing like that ...
they have ... but we 've both got the same problem -- lack or control . we can only keep things miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes . arter that , everything starts growing back to its original size .
now you 're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply ?
uh-huh . and when we get there , we 'll be able to find a way to transport you ... home .
jason , before we entered the black hole , my instruments detected strange energy surge from sarris ' shid~ similar to ...
no time to worry about that , alex . tommy , let 's get this thing slowed down ... gwen , see if you can calculate the impact point . guy , cet down to deck c and make sure tne injured are secured . also lets-
they did n't . the guys felt it was the only way i 'd get a date . anyway , you 're pretty good . you 're elite .
yeah ? you know if you would have said so in the beginning , you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble .
oh no , really . she has her book .
i wo n't hear of it . none of us will .
we 'll be able to start this afternoon . i'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery . now , that 'll impress the governor .
well , bravo ! what with you and whistler 's ma - i think i 've got a winning team .
he means our chances of getting home are not very good . you might have lived a longer life if you 'd stayed where you belong .
i belong here . suppose by some miracle you do get them through . who in the 23rd century knows anything about humpback whales ?
what the fuck are we doing out here ? somebody call the police ! we need help !
pay no attention to this swine . he ca n't handle the medicine .
today ... with dejesus . that was smart thinking to get him inside ...
there probably was n't anything wrong with his suit ...
call off the manhunt looking for me . i did n't kill the transport guards .
it 's already been called off . witnesses confirmed you were n't the shooter . did you find out where the bomb is ?
there we go . there we go . did you keep it safe ? did you
what the hell is with you , dog ? he 's the one with the damn gun .
and you ate two baclavas , right ? i not to touch them , mine was awful .
look , i think i 'm going to have to go to the john again . you go on through , i 'll catch up .
it 's imperative that you get that truck moving .
just cover me . it was built to move .
we 'll talk at home . you know , most girls are n't as lucky as you . for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime .
i know , mom . it was great ... really .
from other people ! i believe she is not crazy , nor is she lying .
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth ?
i suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels ?
oh , no , no . i am not a highwayman , i 'm just a nuisance . all i 'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible .
i wanted to thank you again for going out with me . huh ? well , i do n't know what i 'd do without you . you 've made up for all the fakes that i 've met .
well , that 's very nice . thank you .
i was going to say dimensions . but i guess technically they are dreams .
you should always listen to your subconscious . it 's trying to tell you something about your waking life .
she did n't write to me , did she .
she did n't know what to say . i thought someone should say something . to someone . with me it was , i do n't know -- jenny liked me for some reason . i felt like i owed her .
oh , i 'm not finished . `` when he sauntered into a saloon , his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold , the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple . '' as i said . hmm .
now , sweetie , y'all would n't go believing one of them silly dime novels , would you ?
is this what you wanted to speak to me about ?
in a way -- this girl , thea . you must stay away from her .
well , you ca n't believe everything you read in magazines .
i knew it . i knew it was n't true . boy , how do they get away with printing stuff like that ?
yeah , okay , but see , the dude --
look , jeffrey , i do n't want a partner . in fact i do n't want the father to be someone i have to see socially , or who 'll have any interest in rearing the child himself .
first you tell me to do what i want to , then you tell me to stop .
all i want you to do is think about what 's best for you . really think about it .
you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- gabriela is relevant . when i spoke to you before i did n't know she 'd been seeing eduard .
that 's been noted . but where does it lead us ? unless you have something more to add .
'course they cost a little more than i should really be spending . but , damn it , i do n't hardly ever do anything nice for myself . i deserve nice things .
i . . . ca n't . . . argue . . .
at least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining ...
he 's a total asshole ... he does n't even need that wheelchair , he 's just totally lazy !
chicken pox ? i was six . he did n't leave 'til i was twelve .
he ... apologized , he begged me . he can be very ... charming when it suits his purpose .
no , i said i 'm never goin ' to bed . there 's a difference . see , the article says most people die in their beds . i figure long as i stay outta bed , i 'm safe .
that 's the dumbest thing i ever heard . where do you sleep ?
then you can learn to act normally . i had to !
aw , come on . you know you love me . you 're a masochistic pain freak . you < u > got ta < /u > love me .
that gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin ' with her .
i was goin ' to the secret place . i borried one of your books to take down there . you ai n't mad , are you ?
what do you think 's gon na go on at the guys ' party ?
they 'll probably get drunk , and watch dirty movies . but do n't worry about the dirty movies .
- we thought maybe , if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
that rosebud ? maybe some girl ? there were a lot of them back in the early days , and -
lloyd , what are you doing ? that 's jessica and ... my mom .
harry , this is my fantasy ! i suggest you leave - before i imagine something horrible .
because you cut it from the budget three years running .
how soon will you be able to decode it ?
i did n't know we had any women left .
the world is teeming with women -- ours to enjoy .
i 've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space .
until then , do what you 're told and stay out of my way .
mr. bartholomew -- if you 're trying to frighten me you 're doing a really first-rate job !
please , do what we ask , mrs. lampert -- it 's your only chance .
she did n't say anything about it to me .
well , she 's my mother , not yours .
as usual , i do n't have anything to do .
it 's your own fault and i do n't feel sorry for you .
that 's because , as i have pointed out on numerous occasions , you are a happy idiot .
no , i just happen to take the captain 's advice and look at the bright side of things .
fifteen years ago ? it wo n't wash , pumpkin . no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he 's a father . i was n't born yesterday , you know .
i thought i could handle it . i did n't want to bug you . i thought i could handle it on my own , but i could n't . she 's in real bad , auggie .
ellen , there are two kinds of people in the world --
please not , 'the two kinds of people ' speech .
do n't shoot ! ! do n't shoot ! !
just the man i wanted to see . on this puppy here , you remember if it 's red to blue or blue to red ...
well , okay . well , listen , i 'm gon na get a cigarette , okay ?
yeah , grass , right ? the illusion that it will make a white woman more like billie holiday .
sorry , dick . she 's a little tipsy .
you mean smashed ! she called up at midnight last week . talking a bunch of crap . pat ca n't stand her .
wow ... this one 's cool . and it looks just like a shotgun .
actually , it is a shotgun . hold onto it --
all right , martin , we 'll be in touch with you on the communicator .
and you 'll let me know when you 've got it coming this way ...
i 'll bet you 're sorry the college ever sent you up here .
well , i 'm scared , but i 'm not sorry .
neighbor ! doctor ! i live across the hall .
and you come into mrs. ryan 's apartment as often as you please , looking into various health matters ?
they 're just simple tests , . we 'll both be right here .
look , i know it 's been frightening , i know your dreams have seemed real . but ... it 's okay . okay ?
no , you believed her , we drove all the way to l.a. so that means you trusted her that much ... so why 's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky ? huh ?
'cause i just do n't buy it . call it instinct . call it years of professional know-how ...
`` you do get the opportunity ... you get them . as i do , as anyone does ... ''
ricky ? ... that i do n't care they stole the contracts ?
i almost did n't make it to the bathroom , miguel . i almost lost control right in front of everybody .
so what ? it 's nothing to be ashamed of . you have nothing to be ashamed of , okay ?
everything , my friend . and you hope to be a great sculptor -- a great sculptor . look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long .
but the composition as a whole -- i 've tried to keep a sketchy freedom .
tomorrow we will continue our advance on ulundi . dumford , kindly return to your unit bring them here immediately to support pulleine . mr vereker will join you as adc . do you understand me clearly ?
and the threat of counter invasion no longer exists ?
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death ? nelson said it was an airtight case .
i do n't know what i 'm saying . maybe -- maybe they hired those guys .
yes . there have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure . there was blue beard in france -- jack the ripper in london . it 's not uncommon .
if there were a man like that , with a kink in his brain around here loose , what would he be like .
i thought i 'm not supposed to sit with the customers ...
now why should n't you , walter ? things are different now ...
all right , then make an appointment with her so i can see her !
we ca n't ... but you are so ingenious , leon ...
they 'll want more than your word for that .
all right , then -- i 'll tell them who did do it !
that would be lieutenant garber , and he 's very busy upstairs ...
do n't tell me he 's `` busy '' . i asked for an ambulance for this woman and ...
stolen ! what are you trying to do to me ? ... you 're working with the police ! ... you 're trying to make me say something that can be used against me ! you 're trying ...
hold on , hold on . i 'm trying to help you , if you 're on the square , and i think you are .
come on to bed , you do n't have to brush your teeth .
i 'll just be a second . so what happened tonight at the office ?
teach him how to talk back , suddenly he ca n't stop . i 'm not playing .
sure ? like you did n't play him ? string him along ? if he had gotten the answer right , would you have let him go ?
just wanted to say how much i appreciate you helping me the other day . my niece , she 's cured up , and i got you to thank .
well that 's good . i 'm happy to hear it .
then how come the associated press were the ones found out that mr. mccord is security coordinator for the committee to re-elect the president , otherwise known as creep ?
the head of security for the reelection of a republican president got caught bugging the national offices of the democrats ? what the hell does that mean ?
i want the girl . i do n't care about the rest -- but a us congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy . we 'll make headlines all over the world ...
you 're fucking crazy richter -- you know that ?
my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this . at least < i > he 's < /i > got brains .
< i > him ! < /i > i 'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on .
is n't this ridiculous , doctor ? six months i 've been here and there are still times when i ca n't stand it . i just go to pieces .
there 's nothing ridiculous about it . a kid like you ...
does that paper say we 've been indicted ? does it say exley 's a hero for squealing me and stensland off ?
he made his play amd he got what he wanted . they 're making him a detective .
that was just for fun . how can i leave ? where would i go ?
wherever we want . we 'll get rid of anyone in our way . even your father .
the nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me .
will they ? are you sure ? are you sure or are you blind ?
tch . you are so sweet ... now i know why you 're saying this . ... you 're afraid i 'm in danger and you 're trying to protect me .
no . i think you 're a moron and i do n't want to get into trouble .
this is my house . nobody 's kicking me out of my house . i picked those drapes .
i do n't think anybody wants the drapes , stacy , i think the drapes are okay .
lem me tell you something . you are the pestilence . i 'm the exterminator .
oh joe , be happy for us . i 'll pay you the twenty thousand .
virginia , i 'm flattered you think i got that much energy . i just figured if i ca n't find paul sheldon , at least i can find out what he wrote about .
what do you expect to find ? a story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm ?
i pay his stipend every month , far more dutifully than i should .
that barely covers the cost of his room . there 's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments . opiates to quell his temper . restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves .
oh my , is n't that pretty ! what is it ?
plumbing . everything modern . i 'm going to run pipes all through the village
if they 're blocked memories ... i 'm starting to realize the reason why i blocked them out . allison i think i really ... screwed everything up .
shh . do n't blame yourself trevor . please .
uh ... i 'm shipping out sooner than i thought . i just wanted to be sure you were settled in -- and happy enough , considering ... are you bored stiff ? or can you stick it out for a bit ?
uh ... actually , picking apples is as much excitement as i want for a while . i 'm grateful for the job .
well ... thanks . i think i 'm pretty much set until college on the tic tac front .
you know , i 've been thinking . i 'm really sorry i was such a huge bitch to you . you did n't deserve that . you never deserve any of the poo i unload on you .
please ... go ahead and kill me ! this stuff does n't make you happy , believe me .
oh , come on ! what are you talking about ?
i do n't trust this man . and i did n't like what he did with your opera . it was common .
well , you liked it , did n't you ? monkey-flunki-punki .
apparently not . look , it 's a shit storm here right now . when are you coming back ? i do n't know what to tell people any more .
i 'll get there as soon as i can .
i was gon na split it with you guys .
we do not take tips . i 'll apply this to the cost of the dress .
i told him ... showed him the newspaper . about sethe . read it to him . he left that very day .
you did n't tell me that . i thought he already knew .
lydia is the girl parry likes ... and i thought , if i could get them together i ...
what ? the curse 'll be lifted ? < u > will < /u > < u > you please < /u > !
hey , i asked you if you wanted some chicken .
did n't look like chicken to me , more like fried pussy cat .
thanks , mr. eddy ... whatiya need ? just the regular tune-up ?
i want you to ride with me . somethin ' does n't sound right .
i 've been going through a lot of personal crap , all right ?
oh really ? < u > you 've < /u > been going through a lot of personal crap . you , princess di and madonna ?
emma , which is it -- horace miller or henry hill ?
well , your children are very bright -- and *they* say jefferson smith .
i 'm the same person i was before you knew , damn it ! oh god !
i have to think ! i have to think !
no , no -- believe me , pet -- this is *most* urgent -- hello , hello . is taylor there ? -- governor hopper . quickly , please --
this is n't a home , it 's the crossroads of the world !
we are about to embark on a great voyage .
it is customary to make a little speech on the first day . it does no harm and authors like it .
yes , but ... really , i hate to sound ... it 's just that the public expects something different from its stars . people wo n't take you seriously .
i do n't care if my clothes are taken seriously . or my car .
when we agree to do a job , we do it . right ?
but they 're waiting for me . they do n't even know cledus snow exists .
harold , that picture is almost twenty-five years old .
you have n't changed a bit . i 'll put it in my wallet .
well , we 're here for about two weeks , then whatever else comes along ... we 're still working on our album and ...
great ... great ... listen , i 'm very interested in you guys because i 'll be opening a new club myself soon ... uptown ... and maybe we can work something out ...
< i > either this was some kind of set up ... or the first ladies got scared ... decided to pull out and cut their losses. < /i >
fuck 'em . their loss is our gain . put the money in the safe until we hear from claremont . < b >
how close are you to getting this funding put together ?
it 's almost there . the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time .
i told you , the government pays . it 's all taken care of .
no , you do n't understand . i < i > ca n't < /i > .
it has to be a book the tooth fairy would know lecktor has in his cell .
he 'd know it from articles he 's read about lecktor ...
i would like to know the contents . every detail is important .
what are we doing here , diego ? this guy 's a clown . he 's talking about clothes .
i 've reached another containment door . this thing 's huge ...
that 's the second containment seal . beyond that , engineering .
david , stop stressing , you can like -- turn it on normally ...
no you ca n't , jen ! it 's a new tv . it does n't work without a remote .
it 's just ail that crap he spins out . just once i 'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth .
the truth . i know that 's always been real important to you . okay , check this out ...
the last i looked , we were just talking things over .
but the setup 's there . it 's there now .
it is for your security that i have come , your majesty -- for the security of your honor .
i already know about the riots , d'artagnan , i heard them out there whispering . some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food . i will deal with it tomorrow .
cat . that 's simple . i like it . hi , cat .
we thought you was dead , you know . it 's okay that i live here ?
i ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a c.d . from me . ford . you suck .
i 'll buy you a new one . i found her .
vicki . we got a wealthy millionaire here ... who dresses up like a bat . he goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope . crazy bat-stard !
allie ... he wants to tell me . i had a roll of film . his face was on it . he knew that -- and he let me keep .
oh , sure . well , thanks for everything .
do n't thank me . i should thank you . so long .
all right , darlin ' , do n't go off into the fourth dimension .
i 'm not in the fourth dimension -- -- you are in the fourth dimension , when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control . as blake said , if god had doubt the sun would go out .
we ca n't accept it . it 's much too expensive . right , dear ?
of course , dumpling . its very nice of ted but ...
vicki ? ... this is batman . i thought i 'd call and see how you 're doing .
... i know it 's you , bruce . i 'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it ...
but i do n't know what 's going on .
maybe not . but you know more than i do . you know something about this box . something about a statue ?
how much of this shit do they have , white ! !
they must have got their hands on a test vial !
yeah , but he 's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years . fortune and glory ...
is that what you 're hoping to find at this palace , dr. jones ?
well i did n't know about you until after she was gone .
i thought that ... umm ... maybe you 'd be curious about how i turned out .
we 're supposed to be after a killer , not a string of hookers ...
listen , it may be a little out of date . you know , i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies ...
she died . her lungs were diseased ... two years ago . what is this about ?
memories have come back . i had them forgotten , and wish i could forget them again ... but they are here now . lord , how i hate this place .
pe ? what ? you guys doing gym class ?

i did , did n't i ? i distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
... his majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
all so very boring ! he wants me to learn to fight too , so let me do it !
hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?
look , dave , i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the ao-units , and with your test gear .
shit -- can i tell you how much you 're freaking me out ? okay ? because you are -- you 're completely freaking me out .
i 'm sorry . really . what do you want me to do ?
it 's because i wanted to keep you away from that world .

maybe you should go , alex.you 'll meet someone wonderful .
i discussed it very openly . i told her that i had spoken to lloyd - and that he was interested .
she mentioned , of course , that margo expects to play the part ?

you filthy bastard . i should cave your fucking head in .
you do n't have any baggy shorts ? pajama bottoms ?

who ? they 're all testifying . everybody who was in the o.r . 's going to take the stand .
all right . who was n't in the o.r . ?
why do n't you ask her to stay on for a few days ?
i have asked her but she 's ungrateful . sometimes i feel like hitting her . when i talk to her about the convent , she turns to stone .
do me a favor . do n't pretend for a second that you and i do n't know the truth . you can convince time magazine and the skeptical inquirer of whatever you want , but i was there .
you signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw . you violated that agreement .
do n't tell me you started a polka with leo bartha ?

you trying to tell me how to run my own business ?
no offense , but for a person who says she 's lived an extra lifetime , you certainly are thick . money is power.. money makes people respect you ...
how come you never ask me any important questions ? do n't you wonder if there 's going to be a nuclear war ? or a cure for cancer ? what about your family ? what about people ?
oh , this is big , peter . this is very big . there 's definitely something here .
egon , somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head . do you remember that ?
loosen up , jack . if you do n't , this job 'll get to you . the pressure 's too much , believe me , it 'll break you .

i ... do n't know ... what do you want from me ?
you were in love with him , were n't you ?
i do n't know . how can you know a thing like that afterwards . i do n't know anything any more .
i 'm a teenager . all teenagers are clumsy . it 's because we 're still growing . we do n't know where our bodies end and the world begins .
the world is going to end pretty soon if you do n't learn fast . look , why not make yourself useful ? i 'm just about out of smokes . go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias .
hey , you were never going to give me the money .
i was gon na give you the money . probably i was . shit , i do n't know , i do n't know anything anymore .
we 've got some food coming , should be here any minute .

i said drown 'em all ! who is that ?
if my sister 's in that room , it wo n't make any difference about warrants- and things , i want to go there .
i do n't know if i want to go with you or not .
most people ca n't hear me with the whole orchestra playing . you 're good .
i do n't have to take abuse from you . i have other people dying to give it to me .
you were up late last night , too , rose .
yes , sir . i had to go to the bathroom .
oh , but making up the facts as you go along is ethical ? actually , i meant you . you probably got severance or expenses or both . i 'll take your check . no credit cards .
you 've seen the post-its . i 've already got more juicy material than i need . why should i pay you dollar one ?
you want me to keep that under the table for you ?
if you would n't mind ... it was on sale .
he 's got his nerve , gum-shoeing around here after what you told him .
jimmy , suppose i knew something , say a mug somebody put on somebody ... . you think i should turn him in ?
what makes you think something 's wrong with her ?
a lot of things . she 's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day .
george , i went to the doctor . i do n't have two years .
which brings me to rule number three : which says , fuck rules one and two , skip bail and take off .
yes , and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the final solution . really , who but a jew would want to kill ilio manzetti simply because he was jewish ? who thinks about such things ?
the papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague , curtis zampf , has been a federal informant for the past two years . do you believe that ?
i 'm the chief of police here . i have to talk to him .

hey now , outside of a very friendly dog this morning , it 's been a slow decade . i do n't make love every ten years , i get a little cranky .
it 's also been a long time for me . i --
i need lag bolts , especially one inch standard . and sheet metal . preferably steel , about a sixteenth of an inch . aluminium , even tin 'll do .
i ai n't no mechanic , just so you know .

down the street and across . greely 's beer garden and billiard parlor . just ask for alice and say you want a game of billiards .
billiards , eh ? even though i do n't really wish to play ?
this attitude 's not gon na help him any , is it ?
i got greedy . i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off . that was my mistake . carl would never be so stupid .
you shoulda listened to me , quaid . i was there to keep you outta trouble .
harry , you 're making a big mistake ! you 've got me mixed up with somebody else !
that conway seemed to belong here . in fact , it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here .

i 'd be grateful , admiral , if you 'd give the word .
gentlemen ... may the wind be at our backs . stations please !
she 's joking . junebug has a wonderful sense of humor , which is just one of her many genetic gifts .
i also have good teeth . no cavities . we finally got fluoridated water in dancing elk .
i did n't do anything , francis ! they 've made us believe that ...
why did you do that ? ? ? ! ! !
he 's been in the state hospital a long time , something must be wrong with him .
he 's retarded 's all . you know he 's always after a father figure and lord knows doyle ai n't a good one with his mean ass .
son-of-a-bitch . you 're some piece of work , are n't you ?
i just tell it like it is , mister . if i 'm getting on your nerves , though , you might want to think about hiring me .
gray . they were a lovely , lovely gray .

glad to see you 're not trying to have a heartfelt talk . it 's one of my greatest annoyances , when people talk to those who ca n't hear them .
my father and i have an advantage . we never talk .

i did n't get a good look at him either , but he sure looked at me . i did n't have time to get a window , but i found this key . pretty nifty , huh ?
there was n't any way he coulda known we was in there . we made a clean pick on the lock and did n't leave no footprints in the hall . somebody musta wised him up .

i see them , prof. everywhere . they 're invading my life .
yeah , it is fucked up -- but it 's not too late to keep that from happening here .
all you do is keep folks from working the land , living like they 're meant to . you do n't understand shit ! trappers , hunters -- we 're part of the environment . who 's protecting us ? i 've seen plenty like you . so -more-

your majesty -- some men are content to read about things . i must see them with my own eyes . i can not be other than i am .
-- but nobody has yet , donald . they just have n't been brought to that breaking point . they have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger .
how much more do they need than your death at his hands ?
last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man , which i always hate because it looks bad on the report .
angelo ... i 'm right this time . we can still win this one .
he 's right . a predator would n't leave a kill wounded .
he 's not a kill , he 's still alive .
personally , i think it 's stupid ! but go ahead . have a good time . as long as ellie does n't object .
oh , no . she 'll be crazy about it . well , see you later . i 'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space . goodbye .
yeah . it 's not just the chip , it has a pci bus . but you knew that .
indeed . risc architecture is gon na change everything .

gibberish , my friend . he rants and he raves --
good . it 's better if it were absurd . that would mean nothing much can be done about it .
but just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times ... maybe even just before we left , while i was waiting outside your place ...
i 'd never be able to live with mysel --
nothing 's going to happen . besides , i have to work tonight . the conference is in less than two weeks . i 've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer . this is ...
you are here . i could n't believe it when they told me . what are you doing ?
turn this way . no , no ... not you ... you !
that 's not a spear . it 's a pike .
a severed wolf 's head on a pike as their symbol .
i think it 's the food of the future .
remind me not to go to lunch with you .
writers would n't sell many books if they told how it really is .
but you 're just like the characters in the stories .
brain washing , mind control , that sort of thing ?
re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society . making sure the men who 've gone over the edge wo n't hurt anyone . that sort of thing .
maybe it was yesterday . been seeing me in your dreams ?

i realize you 're under a great deal of stress .. it 's clouded your judgement .
by the time i 'm at the belt , you phone and say , `` how are you ? '' forty-five minutes later i reply , `` not bad . how are you ? ''
i guess i 'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer .
she 's the one who controlled the horseman , is n't she , sir ? sir ?
i need time for thinking . without you hanging on my coattails for a change .
i ca n't talk to the others , but with time to myself , i think about back home , back home at malibu . i used to surf a lot , talby . i used to be a great surfer .

tell me something morgan . in that book of your , did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile ?
yes . they would invade us using only ground tactics . hand to hand combat . they would n't use their technology or fight an airborne battle , because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them .
i want you to try something with me , okay ?
i 've taken a lot of morphine . oral morphine ... for my back . can i wait till i can say no and sound convincing ?

you realize that sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since ? elective plastic surgery , every single one --
it was n't elective . it was undertaken to save his life . and it was n't cosmetic , it was reconstructive ... look at the date of the first procedure .
the place seems more a farm than an inn-yard .
the people are great farmers , as well as inn-keepers .

you get off havin ' control over me . let me choose how to deal with it .
how long 's it been , alfred ? a quarter of a century ? it seems like yesterday . i guess we ended up doing more harm than good .

jesus christ , kid . nobody 's ever cracked sukura .
as far as they know , that 's absolutely true .

spend as much time as possible with diane before she leaves .
how ? ! it 's a machine , alex . machine 's do n't think . they 're not alive . it 's a good program , a brilliant program , it was designed so it would act as if it were alive , but it 's not alive .
so how did it know my name , then ?
how do i find them ? their offices are empty .
they own the whole building . they just move from floor to floor .
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?
hey , take it easy . i 'm just a dude trying to make a buck .
no , do n't worry , i moved on . i was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film , `` bride of the monster . ''
did n't you just make one called `` bride of the atom '' ?
i should 've put them out of the car and come sooner !
when jack sees they 've got rachel he 'll tell them what they want to know .
i 'm afraid so . i spotted him this time and kicked him out , but he 's getting trickier all the time .
i think we 'd better shut off all access till we can find that file . just to be safe .
think you 'll make it all the way to getting your wings ?
who knows ? guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies .

i 'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills .
well , i called erica 's beeper . there 's just no answer .

that 's exactly what i want you to do .
you 're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with . i 'll send morgan or lambert .
swell . i get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments .
how about mrs. ackerman ? we both hate her ! should she be the next victim ?
no ! stop it ! it 's not funny . mom might do it ! someone else might die .
that 's great . it 's a great color for you .
oh , nathan , let 's have a baby !
-- asking the wrong guy -- was n't me who closed it .
sure it was n't . hey , anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies ? do n't raise your hands all at once .
oh , thank you ! thank you ! th -- < i > < /i > something went very , very wrong here .
now we just got ta figure out how to get there .
ok , you 're right , you 're right you know , we need to screen what we 've got invite some regular people , just some random off-the- street types and see what real people think of this .
i dunno , toby . we really have a long way to go . you still need a lot more footage , and it 's probably a little premature to start screening
yes it was . betty saw the whole thing ! your killer 's name is chloe ...
i 'm tellin ' you it was n't no woman , roy !
this - what 's it called ? - this place , i love it - this is mine ! i 'm asking the king permission to call it the almasy bosphorous .
i thought we were against ownership ? i can stay tonight .
i heard someone pulling in behind the house . i heard rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden . i do n't know what they did to her .
which means you ca n't be more than five or ten minutes from here .
someone has seen her . someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars . she is your girl friend , is n't she ?
sam , they do n't want to prosecute , they just want the money back . it was all in cash ...
i ... i wrote you a letter ... reckon you did n't get it ...
one letter in five years ... i read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out ...
i have a policy , aig . it covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days , without a bodyguard , i will not be able to renew it .
i know you need to please lisa . an ass like that is hard to find . good bodyguards are even harder .
that 's five . so . why did you decide to deejay again ?
well it was a friend 's idea , really , and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it . so ... i should really put a james brown in there --
frankly , carl , i ca n't see giving much more . if you have any suggestions i 'll be glad to listen .
there came into egypt a pharoah who did not know .
oh , so i 'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion ?
i never said that . i 'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys . besides , your brother jimmy never gave a shit about you .
we give them something . we tell them we 'll remove the missiles from turkey say , six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage . we also tell them if they go public about it , we deny it and the deal is off .
and we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it .
i did n't get more than a few miles before the sheriff 's car found me . the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman . i never saw the ranch again ...
but what became of your lamb ? clarice ... ?

you know what they say ... the classics are eternal .
how do you do it , kahn ? how do you live so full of life for so long ?
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have . all else is just marking time . you 're marking time .
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth ?
because she 's an innocent . she 's a slate that 's has n't been touched except by god .
i know that . i realize . but if a certain british doctor never asked `` what 's this fungus ? '' we would n't today have penicillin . correct ?
when she 's well enough , i 'll ask .
so , what are you saying ... that he did n't kill all those people ?
my job is not to determine his guilt or innocence . that 's up to the jury . my job is defend him .
i kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night . must have been or twenty -- not counting women and children . it was a real bloodbath . all that screaming ...
pack of lies . do n't listen to him . we did n't kill nobody . we were railroaded . and we gon na prove that .
oh yeah . moonan . i remember now . thanks .
well he 's in town and he sure as shit remembers you . what are we going to do about this jake ? we ca n't afford to have a fed onto us .
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way : an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces !
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part , right , professor ?
the fuck do you have goin ' on with sam albert ?
this guy 's carrying the < u > flag < /u > for the damn terrorism bill . you think this is the best time to piss him off ?
boss , we better roll if we 're going to hit this place , blow it up , and make that flight..
just hold on ! i 'm not done . there are two kinds of men in the world , selina . in category a , you have me . in category b is everyone who wants to be in category a , but are too afraid , too weak.. !
you 're great with the advice , clark . maybe you 'd better take over the lovelorn column .
supposing that man had hurt you ? is it worth risking your life over ten dollars , two credit cards , and a lipstick ? i mean , it 's not as if --
i 've got a reason far beyond confidence : my wife is having our firstborn in five months and i promised i 'd be with her when the baby comes .
very moving , patterson ; i 'm touched you confided in me . but i do n't really give a shit about your upcoming litter . i 've made you with this assignment- -do n't make me break you .
we were going together before i ever let go of you .
i 'm holding you to that . gabe , what about frank ?

indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind .
note that she said 'pretty clearly ' . not 'clearly ' .

to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned .
they were both poisoned . i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder .
he was convicted in a court of law . your testimony put him away . it does n't matter what i think .
during the trial , you did all those stories about me . you called me a liar .
are you suggesting i call him master ? ? ?
no , of course not . i just meant ...
no offense , whistler , but you 're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here . you might have missed something .
which is why you 're here . we could use someone with your experience .
i knew i left these somewhere . one of these 'll send your kids to college someday . here  i made this for you .
thanks . your dad called again  something about a job .
look at his face , he did the deed .
you 're an inspiration lloyd ; you should go on the seven hundred club or something .

brian , do you always have to be so stupid ? think about your future for once .
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint .
technical ... i could n't help you from that angle . you see , a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off .
wai ' , wait . what happens if it works ? four months of training , three years of operational duty . what then ?
i do n't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life , jordan . maybe we should just let it happen .
ca n't we talk about this alone , mr. gittes ?
i 'm afraid not , mrs. mulwray . these men are my operatives and at some point they 're going to assist me . i ca n't do everything myself .
who are you ? how did you know who i am ?
ah guess ole moses knows jes about ever'thing , leastways if it concerns hudsuckuh .
of course not . we 're just not quick to run and boast . in case something went wrong .
and then , something did . carl heine was found dead . with his head crushed .
yeah , i know what your saying . and i 'm saying if you made it that far , they 'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station .

and what are the mau-mau 's going to do for us today ?
we gon na drop some knowledge , wisdom and understanding . the mau- mau 's , we be scientists . we drop science .

you seen this girl ? say ... within the last hours .
i 'm telling you , something 's wrong . i still have n't heard from pendergast . i think you should call it off .
it 's too late now . guests are arriving . the mayor 's car is pulling up .
a missionary 's widow ? it is n't very likely , is it ?
i do n't mean believe , like believing in a religion . i mean , do you believe it has power ? do you think it could heal a sick person ?
these guys look like they 'd sell their mothers .
sometimes they do . they 're river pirates . opium runners .
why not ? now that they 're kicking me upstairs --
could n't happen to a nicer guy . you know , you 're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator .

hey , screw you ! okay ? you think i 'm just somebody you can buy off ! listen , let me tell you something --
hey , hey , hey , i 'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that 's crossing the line !

cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket .
`` ... the special detachment ... '' good ! what is it ?

can i tell diane that peggy sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret ? well ?
no , he tossed the wallet , but he kept the license .
he touched your wallet ! where 's your wallet ?
kinda makes you wonder why more people do n't put a bullet through their fuckin ' skulls , does n't it .
looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth .
what do you mean -- haywire ? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers . you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games . you 're grand ! i 'm for you ! stupendous !
say , you 're always razzing everything i do , but this is one time i 'm in .
give it some time , ellen ... see what happens .
part of me wanted to go off with him , the rest of me could n't ... i do n't know why he wants me ... .

i 'm ted , by the way . i think i forgot to say that .
i know . i 'm ginger . miss april .
run for it ? running 's not a plan . running is what you do when the plan fails . you 're not even trying to come up with a plan !
well , it 's not like we 've got a hell of a lot of options ...
the point is , if you unplug me when i 'm flatlines , i 'm history . i got no way back .
okay fine . let 's get this over with .
i would love to be satisfied harry powell do n't think i 've got that money somewhere .

you two are majorly demented . anyone ever tell you that ?
no . you 've been waiting for this kind of opportunity .
damn right , i have . you think i like living on fucking yucca ? we do a good job on this , we 're in .
now , what is this going to look like to those who do not know what i just told you ?
it 's gon na look like the bad guys are killing each other .

let me remind you who is the new race . and who is the old . what could be gained by withholding anything from them ; by pretending to ignorance ? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable . to start colonization early .

i may not be a pro bowler , but i 'm no amateur man . sheila moves closer to theo .
what about vice-president of the chamber of music , you used that title did n't you ? but then i suppose you had no choice there either , because i suppose dr. goebbels just sent you a telegram saying , dear mr. vice-president .
i do n't think dr. goebbels sent me a telegram . i was simply told . in a letter , i believe . i do n't remember exactly .

the appeal was denied . then daisy went and fell for maynard . they 're engaged to be married , can you believe that ?

would you go on back to the hotel ? take a cab , go on back to the hotel .

i wondered who 'd been giving me a bad name .
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window . it was the only way to bypass the smart glass .
what could there be except just another hill ? in any event , i 'm not curious . at the moment , it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home . i 'd give anything to be in london right now .
of course you would . if ever we get out of this place , the thing for you to do is to take that job with helen 's father .
how is studsy ? i did n't know he was out of stir .
he 's all right . he 'd like to see you . but listen ... what 's the law doing to me ? do they think i did it , or is it just something else to pin on me ?
candle wax . car wax . mustache wax ? could be anything . guy 's waxing his mustache at the beach . gets sand in it . wipes it off with a shoe . shoe scuffs the counter .
the lab made three possible matches , this was one of 'em .
that 's not what i want , jordan . i mean ... it is and it is n't ...

he gets that way when he 's nervous sometimes .

i need help . how many times if just one little thing that i needed would 've happened , it would 've changed everything . if i had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or ... the tumblers just never clicked for me .
dude , you did n't say anything about watches .

feels awful good . yes , sir -- we 're taking the four o'clock train to albany and tomorrow we 'll be married .
is it also not true that you murdered his brother william in a misdirected crime of passion ?
murder willie ? in my heart , he was our child . victor 's and mine . such a thing could never have entered my mind .
oh , do n't they ? i think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own .
not today , burgel . send one of your memos , write up one of your communiques , but for god 's sake do n't bother me today .
forgot ? you handcuffed a civilian to a tree ? !
chief - i know i screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian .

you think you 're so god damned smart , do n't you ?
no , it has to be tomorrow . you wo n't get this many of them in here for another year . it 'll be fine .
it 's not going to be fine . it 's --

chief talley is the one who got you out .
oh yes . it 's very nice + + cut to battlements . the taunter turns to some others . + + man + i told him we already got one . + + they all giggle . +
well ... can we come up and have a look ?
teddy bears , cuckoo clocks , toys all children 's things ...

i 'll need a room over there that faces this way . how much a week ?
only rents by the month . two hundred and fifty for the two of them .
you better not mess with me , rhodes . i 'd love to serve your balls to those red coats for lunch ! think about it !
no , miss science . you 're the one who needs to do some thinking .
holy christ . you want to get us killed ?
do n't be silly . i 'll just tell lester we were smoking a couple of joints . see ?
i bet you do n't think i appreciate you , parker . i do .
well , thanks . you would n't believe what i went through to get those . right after you took my camera , this ambulan --
if you 're worried about anything , let 's take that blood test of yours .
if we 've got any surprises for each other -- we should n't be in any condition to do anything about it . you play chess ?
where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room .
her room -- oh -- i see , mr. preysing -- i understand , mr. general director preysing .
wire burn . trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off .
moray eel . bit right through a wet suit .
i know what you want but it ca n't be done !
take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up --
and what does this do to our bargain ? i can not afford the piano if you mean me to pay .
no , no payment . i have given it back . i do n't want it .
madame , it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is .
you are very sure of yourself , are n't you ?
this gal 's married to i think a philosophy professor at uc santa barbara .
so what 's a professor 's wife doing waitressing ? obviously that 's over .
wanting people to pay attention , you ca n't just tap them on the shoulder . you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer . then , you have their strict attention .
what makes you so special that people should pay attention ?
i know your face . you 're norma desmond . you used to be in pictures . you used to be big .
i am big . it 's the pictures that got small .
god no . all those horrible loved ones and relatives . i dont want to talk to those people . i just want to ... talk to my father . i loved him . im not sure he knew that .
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
i think , yeah , we 'll show you a thing or two .
this is evan mitchell , he steers the thing .
i 'll tell you , bobby -- i 've been away for a long time . very far away .
is it different where you 've been ? do n't they have places like this ?
finish strong ! are you < u > nuts < /u > ? are you nuts ? this 's pennies from < u > heaven < /u > ... on his triumphal return home , old shoe , his plane forced down ... and yet ...
he 's supposed to be flying in from europe .
it 's no use , dad . i practically threw myself at him .
well , under the circumstances , do n't you think we ought to call this thing off ?
ah . well . congratulations . meanwhile , what is james supposed to do ? pray for walter gaskell to come to his ?
walter gaskell is n't going to send james leer to jail , crabs . i know that .
i do n't think that 's such a safe idea
my niece 's life hangs in the balance right now ! ! every second counts .
working . charlie and i were going over some statements .
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you . you were with her , were n't you ?
no more jokes , drop it or she gets it between the eyes !
whoa , hans , now you 're the cowboy ?
you son of a bitch , you know what time it is ?
we just left old earth . you 'll never believe what we found .
now , please , ninotchka , do n't start figuring it out in cows .
you 've done it again and i am responsible . how can you forget yourselves this way ? you were sent here to make money , not to spend it .
man , put your boxes down and stay as long as you like . we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out .
well if you 're sure , i wo n't be a bother . oh , i do n't sleep on no spring mattress . i always make myself a pallet on the floor .
ca n't you forget for just one night that you 're completely wretched ?
at least i 'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig .
he 's right you know . waiting for the pusher , she 'd tell you anything .
i believed her : the dumper was not tom grunemann .
yeah , i get it . time to play let 's dick the old guys , huh , harp ?
supervising special agent , harp . now i want you to go work the drop car , okay , angelo ? okay ?
that 's what i been thinkin ' about . how you been keepin ' me . i ai n't getting ' nothing outta this gig .
gus , if there 's anything i hate , it 's greed .
what kind of a girl are you , anyway ?
just what you see . a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution .
luke , i need to switch next friday for thursday , so why do n't you take the weekend ... ... that way you 'll be there , and i 'll pick up monday , tuesday , and wednesday .
fine . but i wanted to take the kids to work with me on wednesday so i 'll take wednesday , and you can pick up that thursday , friday after soccer , and saturday before riding .
well , you got your circulation . now , why do n't you let me alone ?
oh , it started as a circulation stunt , but it is n't any more . mr. norton wants to get back of it and sponsor john doe clubs all over the country . he wants to send you on a lecture tour .
and the `` triumphant return of dj rob gordon ? '' `` triumphant ? '' `` return ? ''
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we were n't together anymore . it might even be why i came back .
sure , i suppose . that why you 're on a bender ?
this is not a bender yet . this is the start of a bender . but i can see how you were confused , they look a lot alike .
transport xj . get out of here . go !
the energy shield is down . we 'll be stuck here forever .
well , then , from now on , i 'm gon na start keepin ' records .
artie , no records , artie . what are you gon na do with records ? pay taxes ?
sure know it was n't me . and if you say it was n't you -- then who the hell did , evelyn ?
it you really loved me , steven , you 'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds .
good grades . fine athlete . president of his class .
i was n't there . like i was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse . like i was invisible .
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground . our hands are completely tied while they 're in the air .
okay , gentlemen , we 'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane ... lee , go huddle with the d.o.d . i want an options paper on this in minutes .
shush . janet 's probably asleep by now . do you want her to see you like this ?
like this . like how ? it 's your fault - you 're to blame . i thought it was the real thing .
come on , mom . we 're gon na miss all the fun stuff !
danny , you 're just going to have to wait !
since he and his wife have been in custody , they 've killed -- -
do n't recite the fact to me . i 'm sure i know 'em better than you do .
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit . but just because i think it 's bullshit does n't mean i do n't know something about it .
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems , i 'll take brutal indifference .
and this happened before you and i hooked up ?
it 's been going on for a while . then he called me a disgrace to our family and that 's when he hit me .
the falkner sisters are rather timid , your honor , and wish to be together . if the court pleases , i will only have one of them testify .
yes ! yes ! let 's get on with it .
they killed our friend . it 's personal now . besides , if we do that , then julien died for nothing . the tapes are the key .
he 's right . the tapes give us leverage with bastaldi .
that does n't mean it was rick 's party .
debbie , men are pigs -- if they can have women , we can have men .
we 're not ? how do you figure that ?
we 'll take the money and disappear ! we can do it , spend it on the move . even if all of it 's marked , there 's ways around it .
lonnegan 's a fast egg , henry . he 's not gon na sit still for a standard play .
everybody 'll sit still for somethin ' . what did ya find out about the train , eddie ?
i said -- uh -- i said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you .
do n't be embarrassed , bruce . i heard it , but i just wanted to hear it again . i can stand being spoiled a little . the gentleman i 'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling .
lila , what are you doing in there ? i need to get ready for my date .
nothing ! i 'll be out in a minute !
that kubelik -- boy ! would i like to get her on a slow elevator to china .
oh , yes . she 's the best operator in the building .
because i 've been kidding myself . because i realized you were right from the beginning . this whole thing was just a wild goose chase .
so , you 've had a little bad luck .
mary robert , i am so sorry about last night ...
now stop that . you did n't shoot at me . you were only trying to help , to give me experience . i tried to explain that to reverend mother , but -- i do n't know if she understood .
it has no purpose . it 's just beautiful ... does everything have a purpose where you come from ?
most things . we 're very high on purpose .
about the other day ... i 've been thinking .
so have i. and i know you want to make things perfect for me . and i understand that you really would n't tell me that until you were % comfortable with it .
well -- at the moment , that 'd be me .
and without it , that party is exposed -- a sitting duck . no wriggle room .
that was damn good , wad'n it ? i finally did it ...
yeah , great . why do n't you throw z 's for frames , and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game ? just wonderful .
% . that 's my final offer . i 'm not kidding . that 's how much it means to me not to hear you play .
we 're not as bad as you think , rob .
so my little brother 's staying here . i 'm sleeping with rita .
oh je -- could n't he sleep with rita ? we'11 all have a good time .
but you 'd love for him to play at usc , like you did .
i 'd love for him to get a good education . that 's it .
so he 's personally issued the contract on israel ?
sparazza was the one who introduced israel to the life , gave him his first big break , brought him through the ranks .
you just think you do n't want your windshield cleaned .
no , i know i do n't want it cleaned . get out of here .
i think treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government .
we should be . everybody wants what we have .
... i ran the bio-scan with the dna/rna filter . the results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin ...
`` ... bio-readings of indeterminate origin , '' do n't you have anything useful to tell me ?
sometimes i wonder what i 'll do if carl does n't get out . i 'm not very adept at being on my own . i 've always had a man in my life . always .
i remember when i first met you : little helen watts from the wrong side of somewhere . i had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed .
with all the blood i guess they did n't see the rig . guy had it under a wig .
yeah , but how 'd it get to you ?
it is tomorrow . four a.m. how come you 're so late ?
roberts did n't show up . what could i say ? besides , it 's double time .
i do remember and i was impressed . anyway , that 's all forgotten now . driver !
thank you , sid , but the reason i mention it is , it would require such a small capital investment -- again , you 're the expert here --
me and my real estate ? how many other girls , miss teschmacher , are lucky enough to have a park avenue address like this ?
it is n't a park avenue address . really .
sid ! oh , it 's beautiful ! you mean ...
that 's right . let 's get married , lynette . let 's find a justice of the peace and just do it !
so you see , the point and the theme of the film is kept intact . and of course , the mpaa did n't cut out any of the graphic violence . what did you think ?
oh man , i 'm gon na need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie .
i 'm bored . i 'm alone all day and i do n't know what to do .
you should have enough to do in this house ... come here and listen to this .
no , not that , no ... i mean this , the whole thing . start writing to a guy , guy in the bricks . get a boyfriend like this . tell me the truth .
well . you 're not the first guy i wrote to . but you 're the only one i kept writing to .
if i had to guess , i 'd say the blackouts are stress related .
but he 's seven . what kind of stress can he have ?
are you with the fbi , mr . balint ? ... or any other law enforcement agency ?
i was going to ask you the same thing .
you have to tell me what you 're doing with my venom .
you must show me your secrets , blossom , before i show you mine .
... i thought you were dead . going home ?
no . i think i 'll stay right here in hell .
i 'm a witch . a white witch . why do n't we move on ?
are you going to put a spell on me ?
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost .
have no fear . it will come out well for me .
okay . i just thought as long as it was paid for --
do n't ever talk like that , fran ! do n't make yourself out to be cheap .
`` what about you ? what will your dad think about you ? ''
`` stop ! just stop ! that 's what you said from the beginning . if i tell what happened ... they 'll arrest you and put you in jail , so get out of here before ... ''
in a few days . out to your stompin ' grounds as a matter of fact  new york city . things have gotten all balled up at the head office .
i 'm truly sorry to hear that , charlie . i 'll miss you .
yeah . i 'm working on a masters in horticulture . chipping away at it .
horticulture ? wow . i did n't know there was a college here .
frustrating . form over content . everything 's so retro .
well , if peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you ...
i do n't know what we 're talking about .
we 're talking about marseille . we 're talking about nykwana wombosi . and i 'm asking you if this abortion in marseille has anything to do with treadstone . was this treadstone ?
ah-hah , i see . a cozy dinner . but are n't threesomes a little awkward ? how does the phrase go --
three 's a crowd . yes , i 'm aware of that . but i have to keep an eye on mr. benjamin wherever he goes . to make sure he does n't get himself into trouble .
this is very interesting . we are born knowing our history . we have other books . but not a book like this .
any words you do n't know you can find in the dictionary .
come , come , sir . i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool .
i think , sir william cosgrove , you have had too much drink . your chaplin , mr. hunt , has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter , of which she is a considerable expert .
what is it ? some tits ? a beaver shot ? what ?
no , these are the tapes from the living room . check this out .
well , mr. smarty-pants detective , your logic is specious . what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him ?
because he 's not forty feet tall . the safe was up on the ceiling , remember ?
you got to investigate . no question about it .
what i will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end . you know how the press is with a murder story -- even if it 's forty years old .
i promised to protect her from people like you .
for once in my life , i am not the issue .
in my day , it was simply called the double cross . i believe the cia refers to it as mindfuck . in our context , it simply means infiltration of the democrats .
i know what it means -- segretti would n't go on the record , but if he would , we know he 'd implicate chapin . and that would put us inside the white house .
you could have looked in my car . oh , but you did n't know my car , did you ?
yes , i knew which one it was . it 's out there , now . but i did n't think you 'd want to be brought home that way .
doctor mccoy , what is your current medical status ?
aside from a touch of arthritis , i 'd say pretty good .
i 'd like to find a place where i can get some peace and rest , maybe around here somewhere . i 'd like to try ...
what could be more restful than this ? ... excuse me , what is it that you want to try ?
i , uh , know a guy at the power company .
i do n't understand . why did you want to come here ? i mean , i ca n't imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me .
maybe i wanted to give my husband a fright .
a fright ? ... five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright ?
wait a minute . i 'm letting < i > you < /i > in on this , not all your friends .
you just ask me how we gon na do it . that 's what i 'm here for , tell you how . we the experts .
what do you mean , 'that 's all ' ? what in the hell do you know ?
the bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars .
i do n't particularly want to talk to you .
well ... if you 're not gon na fire me i might as well quit .
i got to see my husband , sheriff young !
i 'd like to help you , rebecca . but all that would do , is git us both in trouble .
larry , if you 'd see these clowns leave , you 'd never believe they 'd come back with anything . but they got him !
that 's good . that 's real good . ben meadows getting pictures for the paper .
cecile , we just made out in the middle of central park . you can trust me .
i do like him . i ca n't stop thinking about him .
rick , that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed .
well , he 's succeeded in impressing half the world .
with a , with a stranger ? with a --
just think about it . that 's all i ask .
i do n't know . but all i know is that i kicked him so many times my fuckin ' toe feels broken .
yo , we might have killed him . you think ?
you come out here and talk to me , you fucker !
will you stop it ? you 're drunk , you 're on drugs . you 're gon na -
yeah ... we 're gon na paint in the spring . after the rains . look good as new .
you ask me out here to sell me your house , frank ?
of course i know it 's gone . you remind me every day !
your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name . and that name is the only card we have to play .
absolutely not . i am very sorry , but no .
we can save this young woman 's life , and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture .
then who the hell have you been talking too ?
we do n't exactly know , sir . he wo n't give us him name . he appears to be the man who called in the report ... he 's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others .
he told me about the terrible things that happened here . in our house .
what the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
it was no accident . it was krueger . he used to get in through my dreams , but not anymore . he 's found some other way .
alice , it 's no dream . i 'm sorry ... dan 's dead .
yeah , you know , probably one of these fast-talking career gals , thinks she 's one of the boys . probably is one of the boys , if you know what i mean .
i 'm quite sure i do n't know what you mean .
personally , i 'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the trans american building with my pals . instead of giving myself a headache over stuff i ca n't do anything about .
you accept the way things are , you 're an active participant in making it worse .
what ? what do you want me to do ?
what do you think ? get us into that room .
-well , it 's just ... ... other men do n't abandon their wives at such a time-
-oh please- if i 'd been against your taking this , you would have abandoned me . you 've been desperate to see africa your whole life .
no . these are her first steps . watch her .
yeah . i know . she did that before .
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw .
lydia . what the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people wo n't let me relax ? go help your mother .
let me get this straight . we drove all the way down to klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking ?
what are you complaining about ? it worked out . everything 's cool . now , come on , let 's head down there and see what 's shaking . we deserve a little reward .
i do n't want your dead body . i do n't want you back in jail either .
but it 's yours . i wo n't let them ...
do n't worry . i do n't wear it at the dinner table .
no matter how often i see guns , i still ca n't get used to them .
did you tell him he was spending the summer with me ?
no . i was going to let you do that .
we need scissors over here ! who 's got scissors ? okay , remember . jack and i go on first , i do the set-up , then introduce you . and you say ...
good evening , ladies and gentlemen . i ca n't tell you how thrilled i am to be here . it 's like a dream come true . and speaking of dreams ...
i mean . some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered .
yeah , well i never wanted to get slaughtered much .
we stop we die . keep holding the thruster down tommy !
you do n't hold a thruster down ! it 's for quick boosts
all i could think of was ... not here . i do n't wan na eat it on an indian reservation , three thousand miles from home .
he 's out there . he 's out there playing sitting bull with us . i want the motherfucker so bad i 'm getting a bleeding ulcer .
hey , you come on my rig , you do n't talk to me , you start ordering my guys around . it wo n't work . you got ta know how to handle these people ... we have a certain way of doing things here .
i 'm not interested in your way of doing things . just get your team ready to dive .
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night . hawthorne 's examining the body now . there 's even less of him than of singh .
but it 's crazy- the lion should n't be that hungry this soon . samuel ?
that damned arnold is here , is n't he ? did you know he lost all his ships ? outrageous and completely unacceptable .
joseph , the british spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges . in my opinion he saved my army .
problem my ass ! i think you 're lying to me , and if you are you 're a dead man !
would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there ?
yeah , right to the cops . no way .
mary robert , do n't panic . remember what we talked about ? experience ?
you put your disease in me . your semen . it 's hot and full of disease .
there 's no disease , i can tell you .
if that 's your case , you did n't have a case . i would n't believe whatever habighorst said , anyway .
i ca n't believe you 're saying this in the courtroom .
you were just a poor , innocent victim of circumstance , huh ?
i 'm neither poor nor innocent , but the truth of that particular ...
alright , the one on the airplane had an accident , but usually babies do n't smell .
they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous .
nah , it 's september . must be the new one .
the new one ! that 's supposed to be a girl !
that 's okay , hon , i always expect the unexpected .
i called because i just want ... i need to talk .
the hell is that ? what kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you 're talking to her ?
buttholus extremus . but hey , you 're making progress .
it was self-defense , tubbs ! they 're dirty ! i walked in on something , i do n't know what -
you got ta turn yourself in . before it 's too late -
good old paden . i was hoping you 'd changed your mind about the job .
you did n't tell me you owned a saloon .
ok not your imports . all your other cds and your k2 snowboard .
that 's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting ?
that 's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit .
it should work -- theoretically . if it does n't , the mission 's off . the craft 's nuclear-powered . except for your wireless .
funny , i do n't get that feeling . maybe it 's because you found out i 'm bill parrish 's daughter .
cut it out , susan . you and i 've got to talk . big day tomorrow , everybody . joe , let 's go .
daniel webster ? sat here ? say -- that man was a great orator .
give you something to shoot at , senator -- if you figure on doing any talking .
i ask you one simple question , and suddenly i 'm attacking you .
listen . i 'll call you when we get there , and we can talk about it then , okay ?
`` routine , '' my ass ! ai n't nothin ' `` routine '' about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down ... especially when we 're getting picked up the next day !
he did n't say it was a `` routine check-up , '' he said it was a `` routine < u > precaution < /u > . ''
i just had a lot of luck ... from my first show , you know ? i 've always thought lee was the one destined for great things .
yes , she 's lovely , but she does n't have your spark . she knows it . she worships you . she would n't dare get up there on the stage .
there , you see , captain . a rock !
when they lost this rock their fields and animals died . they also said their children were taken from them .
yes , a good piece of apfel strudel ... .
we will get that ... we 'll get everything ... maybe a little bit later but we 'll get it ... we must be patient ... finally we got the spring , did n't we ? we got the swallows , and you will get your apfel strudel too .
i prefer , by far , to be remembered for my own small contributions to science . now if we can proceed to your questions .
well sir ... i 'm not sure i understand the distinction between 'reflexive ' and 'voluntary ' nerve impulses .
-- then you do n't wish to call any witnesses , mr. dowd ?
i would like to put shu 's alleged crime in a context , your honor . and we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room ... if it please the court , i 'd like to call mr. reynard .
you better be careful . you 'll get a stroke arguing .
i would n't care if i drop dead if he learn something from it . son , you make me wish i was dead .
first she loved him , then she did n't , then no one else could have him ...
she *did* love him ! how many women have you known ?
that so ? you want to tell me what , if any , real thoughts you had lately ?
what you have to get personal about so quick ? all i mean is you could possibly read a book .
yeah , and gradually you get old and die . you know it 's important to make a little effort once in a while .
do n't you think his girl friend 's beautiful ?
that is n't a waiter , my dear . that 's a butler .
well , i ca n't yell `` oh , butler , '' can i ? maybe somebody 's name is butler ...
certainly a radio this small is very practical . it 's especially useful for ... i do n't know ... for traveling .
but for you , what comes first : music or love ?
i wish i could say the same for george zipp .
be patient , ted . no one expects you to get over this immediately .
mr. mintz ? i dont think so ... buildings closed pal . youll have to come back tomorrow .
look , i dont know whats going on here but i am senior vice president of this company .
there are n't any . if the filmmakers are happy , simone 's happy . she considers herself an ... `` instrument '' .
really ? oh , so she 's really going to do all this nudity ?
something like that . how much do you make ?
here ? what a joke . there was some detective asking about that girl .
most outlandish thing i ever heard tell . do n't seem right , somehow !
but it 's true . take 'em up in your hands , mary -- feel 'em -- they 're real all right . are n't you glad ?
if there is anything we can do for you ...
no , not a thing . would you like to go out ?
... freddie ! what 's the matter ? you 've been like this all evening .
oh ... i 've just been thinking about something that man bytes said .
i 'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact i 'm not taking the job .
why do you keep playing at being so humble ? it 's a little embarrassing .
i do n't think you 're giving him enough credit . i know sometimes he does n't think an idea through . he gets too excited . but --
as far as i can tell he has n't thought his life through . he 'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car . but business ? you i can work with . you i could groom . dignan 's not going to make it .
i 'd be helpless and useless . they do n't have the pem . without that ... there 's no chance .
well ... they sure as hell are n't gon na get it for you .
gale shoulda aired that bit first , she 's the one who found this clown laplante ! she let channel eight get a beat on us .
listen , deak , what if bubber < u > has < /u > got something to hide ? what if he 's the wrong guy , not really the hero ... ?
what it 's going to say on the jacobi film can is the same as it says on the leeds ' film can : gateway lab , st. louis , missouri .
is there a label on the jacobi can that says what lab processed it ?
you know , i 've thought about that , actually .
no , man , i mean it . you 're a good writer . i remember those things you 'd write during honors english . funny shit .
sure , they 're safer . you always know what they 're going to do . trouble is , it gets a little dull .
there 's nothing dull about a man i can depend on to be civilized .
well , thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it .
do n't thank me , dr. johnson . you were n't my choice . the pentagon made me take you .
i have a few people here , i ca n't really chat right now .
`` chat ? '' did you just say `` chat ? ''
what do you want me to tell her , dave ?
oh , to hell with it , never mind . do n't tell her anything . do n't even tell her you saw me . got to run , buddy , i 'll miss my plane .
i think you 'd better give it a trial spin . do n't want any bad word of mouth about california charlie .
i 'd really rather not . please . ca n't we just settle this and ...
client notes . sorry . what can i do for you ?
my name is esther . chief bloomenbergensteinenthal from the jewish defense league desperately needs to speak with you .
ok , look . we all know that this has something to do with 'stab ' . what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott .
actually , there was more this time . this time , we found a picture too .
those were police laboratory people , they 've been over the apartment .
oh zippidy-doo , they 'll find my fingerprints . can i go in ? i need some stuff .
there 's four other angles , man , we have n't even --
-- great : we can watch domini sleep for hours -- or , shit , maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days , maybe a deer 'll dash by !
to do what ... ? to do what , for chrissake ... ? to help her to do what ? she 's dead ...
they killed her . and they 're trying to buy it ...
david , now i know this may be hard for you , but i have to warn you .
warn me ? will you get out of here , you meat loaf ?
mr. stipe . a young man named jimmy chin was shot to death eight years ago , in chinatown . do you remember talking to the police ?
that guy they arrested -- he was the wrong g-guy .
here -- let me give you a boy ranger button .
swell . thanks very much . good luck , senator . keep your left up .
they 're afraid of our light . that means we do n't have to be so afraid of them .
and you 're certain you can find the way back ? even in the dark ?
how did he know he 'd get the chance ? he could n't have arranged it .
he could have tried . if he was up there in the dark , listening , he 'd know when she came home , know when she found mitchell dead , know what she did about it . if she telephoned , he 'd probably hear that .
hello ! do you speak english ? parla usted inglese ? i 'll say it again . did i urinate on your rug ?
well no , like i said , woo peed on the rug --
rollo , you know me . once a gp , always a gp .
you want to help sick people for the rest of your life ? god forbid i should talk you out of it .
trip , a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make . and even if it did , at least my mom did n't give birth to me while she was on lsd .
shrooms ! and even if it was lsd , i can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day .
i have a seat . i 've had it since nine .
... mr. athol will be with you as soon as possible . will you be able to wait ?
filthy kids go to kindergarten too . what are you saying , anyhow ?
nothing , i guess . just an observation . she 's really something special . you 're a lucky fella .
ooh yes . i think we 'll have to give detention to those boys .
forgive me for saying so , principal victoria , but your methods are too ... shall we say ... soft ? as head of the pta , i am exercising my right under article of the pta code .
he 's crazy . he ca n't help it .
well , why do n't they put him away ? prisons do n't want him . i took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again .
i 'm not feeling very well , larry . i say we go back to the hospital and call it a night .
you have no sick time , frank . no time of any kind . everyone knows that .
so . wide cross-section of men to evaluate . and the day that the defendant volunteered for this ... demonstration . did you find him eager ?
more than eager . he was out to make a point .
this could be our last night on earth . i do n't want to die a virgin .
if we do , we 'll both die virgins . but at last we 'll be together .
you touch my spleen , rollo . and here all the time i was thinking -- if i ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well , at least there 's rollo . he 's in vd and he 's happy .
i 'm still a vd man under the skin , rog . you know me . i 'm a down-to-earth kinda guy , right ?
it does n't make sense to me . what 's so different about it here from over there , or any place you go , that one person could n't live in both places just as easily ?
some people can . now if you 'll let me explain --
you are lucky , convict . you 're spending christmas with the birthday boy himself --
hey ! hey ! there is a powwow safe !
it 's in my family , you know . my grandmother died in an institution ...
really ? hell , if having a screwy family made you crazy , the world 'd be one colossal nuthouse .
individual whale song getting stronger ... this is strange , admiral . the song is directly ahead . it 's coming from san francisco .
from a city ? that does n't make sense ... .

you 'll know presently . at the meeting of the society . but until then , i beg of you fox , keep it to yourself .
it 's make the bergs harder to see , with no breaking water at the base .
mmmmm . well , i 'm off . maintain speed and heading , mr. lightoller .
i 'm sorry , general . the cellar is empty .
you have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty ? did they drink my whiskey ?
and you think he 'll be in a fit state to resurrect , after thirteen years ?
if he was just a man like me , then no . but he 's not .
so ? you wanted castro dead . everybody wanted castro dead . if hunt and the others are cia , why do n't we just throw this back in the cia 's lap ? let richard helms take the fall ?
because ... because dick helms knows too much ... if anyone in this country knows more than i do , it 's hoover and helms ! you do n't fuck with dick helms ! period .
sure , an ' i 'm smart enough to know that no sparrin ' partner should take cheap shots at the champ . he 's just there to help condition the man .
not spar , i 'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting creed for the championship .
that 's all right . i got it off my chest .
the difference between them and me is i know when i 've been a skunk . you take me to the nearest news- stand and i 'll eat a pack of your postcards raw . raw !
reed . even you ca n't compute every little thing .
i should have done more , run more tests --
that makes total sense . the treasure chest was in his office . which means principal collins is a pirate ! i 'm surprised captain rob never mentioned him .
that 's because captain rob is not a pirate . we 've been through this .
well , jackie , you got caught , you 're gon na have to give 'em something .
but if all i can give 'em is ordell 's name -- i do n't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- that do n't give me much to bargain with .
inside the precog who predicted it . all you have to do is download it .

you seem a decent fellow . i hate to kill you .
you seem a decent fellow . i hate to die .
so , our lawyers had a talk with the committee 's lawyers . that elvin clyde fella wo n't be too happy about it , but we cut a deal . they cleared you -- and they 're gon na thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself .

yes , the little ratfuckers are now running our government .

miguel has not been infected . as i said , we were n't aware of aids , then , or how it is spread .

okay . it was funny . but it cost me money .
come on , amigo , the world 's full of marks . and nobody knows how to work 'em like you do , pal . you could sell a goddamn rat 's asshole for a wedding ring ! let me buy you a drink .

emma ! i will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner !
and i get to keep the equipment when we 're done .
luther , i guess you 're all out of excuses .

[ and one of the founding members of la hermanidad . ]
goddamn , did n't you hear him ! he practically pulled the goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
christ , ca n't you read between the lines ! he did everything he could to save him ... if he gave himself up they 'd both be dead !
what is that , mahogany ? what happens if you crack the neck ?
tell me about it . i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago , and one night we opened for the melvins ... do you know who the melvins are ?
god , that 's so pathetic . i bet she did n't even notice him .
i know . and he 's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail .
i do n't know if the fu-cang-long paid you to get rid of tan , or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you 're off this case . i do n't ever want to see you again , you got that ?
hey , you , secret service man , what are you --
he is at a fragile point . he 's got problems --
what problems does he have , sean , that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with --

yes , it was about in the morning . i was driving west on elm street toward the triple underpass , in a rented car - a blue valiant . i 'll never forget that day .
i love winning , crash , you hear me ? i love it . teach me everything .
it 's time you started working on your interviews .
i was only joking , really ... ca n't i make a joke ? and now you 've got to tell me why you do n't want to .
oh , sandro ... i want everything you do . but ...
shit , i do n't have her number . she was never interviewed . she took off right after the accident .
how are we going to find her ? there must be thousands of white vans in this state .
i mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night ?
do n't worry about the old lady . one squawk from her , and she 's out of a job .
mitchell was killed down here . how could clarendon get in to do it ? or margo for that matter .
how could mitchell ? after that act he put on up here , is it likely she 'd let him in ?
okay . but i do understand that your partner , leon jackson 's been injured . is that correct ?
he was hurt , but not seriously . he 'll be fine .
you look terrible . i want you to eat well , to rest . and spend time with your family . and then , at the end of the month , this big shot will give you the part you want .
it 's too late . all the contracts have been signed , they 're almost ready to shoot .
oh , actually it was . then why 'd you call it off ?
who says i 'm the one that called it off ?
romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughter almost finished ?
without doubt he is completing it at this very moment .
you 've got a lot of fucking gall . thirty nine .
five years ago , i was at the party , remember ?
you may not like it , but this is the world we live in , alex . little grey men with little grey hats .
but should n't it be better ? should n't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this ?
sit your suspect out in the cold . he 'll keep .
this man 's friends ai n't gon na look favorably on his incarceration .
by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you , stan called from the hospital and it was too late .
too late ? jody , it was an accident .
still working on being the first girl in the nba ?
well , i tried sneaking in after college , but they found breasts during my physical .

and that pose is out too , sunny jim . the new thing is to care passionately , and be right wing . anyway , you wo n't meet susan if you do n't cooperate .
and who 's this susan when she 's at home ?
in the navy , we used to call guys --
fasten your flap ! all you newmeats gon na have to shape up fast and hard on this gang . we got rules here an ' in order to learn them , you got ta keep your ears open and your mouths shut .

you 're damn right i do . five years down here and i 'll pull in more than topside . i 'm not down here for the fun , i 'll tell you that .
i went myself to oversee the operation . did n't help much .
no , that one was close . a couple fellas quit after that one .
nobody else , but i 've been through that stuff of walter thatcher 's . that journal of his -
thatcher ! that man was the biggest darn fool i ever met -
this is not a good time to take chances . your best friend , robert , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . we see him from time to time . he comes down to church for a free meal .
this is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .
no , i ... i held it up to ...
you held up your sword and flourished it about in the air ? like this ?
calm down , mrs. lampert -- please . does he have the money ?
no , i do -- it was the stamps on that letter charles had with him on the train . they were in plain sight all the time , but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope .
not in that way ; you 're always looking for company .
why do you say that ? perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous .
we have reason to believe she came this way ... might have stopped in this area ... did she stop here ?
no . no one has stopped here in weeks ...
lloyd , when we were in principal collins 's office , did you see any kind of chest ?
harry 's treasure chest ? sure . i know where that is .

sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today ?
i do n't know . maybe there 's two of them . maybe he hired some wino to make the calls .
and remember that trip we took to africa ? that safari was so wonderful . me , you ... best of friends ... forever .
uh , alex , we 've only know each other one day .
we 're driving out to the country tomorrow night . just the four of us . bill , margo , you and i ...
well . we 've spent weekends before with nobody talking ... ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects ...
you seem pretty sure of the date . did i ask you to sit ?
no sir but you struck me as a man who would n't want to waste a chair . i remember dates . names . numbers . i saw him on november 28th .
you signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw . you violated that agreement .
you cost me my livelihood . that on which i relied to support my children .
yeah . i really blew it . i still think about her .
well , have you asked her to come back ?
i just do n't want to go over it any more .
i know things have n't been right for a long time , but it 'll be different . if you 'll just be patient , i can work things out .
how do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions ?
i 'd rather you just talked . anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and mr. kane .
you know , i do n't know this town any more . all this traffic , new buildings , prosperity ... where have the years gone , daddy ? where is the little town i knew as a boy ?
at rest in the creative universe with mother , son .
i did n't say i 'm going to die , but if i should --
do n't say that ! i do n't want to hear you say that !
no one would ever have to know its not him .
wait a minute ! what if everybody knew ? what if we presented malkovich as the world 's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him ? we 'd wipe the floor with the great mantini !
she asked me what i was thinking about ? what should i have done ? lie ?
you did n't have to get into it , baby .
the mainland ... is dead ... a dead place ... nobody there ...
where are your headquarters , rebel ? tell me or i 'll let you hang there forever ... forever !
many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body . where has it been laid out ?
it has n't been laid out , we have n't finished with the embalming . as a matter of fact , you 're looking at it . the remains of margo channing . sitting up . it is my last wish to be buried sitting up .
we 'll surely be in our graves if we do n't .
going grows slower ... we 've not made ... half a mile in two hours ...
from vince ? what a guy . doo-lang , doo- lang .
at least he 's not a cop . at least he can afford a decent gift .

the least you can do is show me a little appreciation .
i mean we can still ... whatever ... maybe i should get a towel ?
no . no , i 'm fine . maybe i should go . i mean ... i do n't want our first time to be like this .
sir , bob and i are gon na have to testify before earvin 's committee .
no , you 're not ! you 're going to claim executive privilege and you 're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the fifth amendment . i do n't give a shit . they ca n't force the president 's people to testify .
< u > she < /u > did n't try to conceal it .

not a chance . i 'm the thinnest person i know .
honey , in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test . oswald was a radar operator . he 'd have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas .
these books are getting to your mind , mr. garrison . i wish you 'd stop readin ' them .
the fabric of life . the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another .
if that was meant to be an ex- planation mr. romirez from spain , i 'm afraid you 've failed .
i 'm not asking you to set me up , jay . that 's not what i need your help for . i want to know what it 's like over there .
and that 's what i 'm trying to tell you . what women are looking over , okay ? pecs and a cute butt .
do n't worry . i have already made reservations . it 's perfect flying weather . they assure me there 's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to moscow in no time .
if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny . or do you still think you 're issuing orders from your palace in petrograd ?
that 's rough , man . if i do n't get steamed dumplings once a week , i go crazy .
tell me the truth , carter . do you think i have a good voice ?
it 's not puppy love , gordon . anyway , buddy and i are splitting up .
sorry to hear that . i thought the kid had staying power .
you 've got to quit looking for what is n't there . they 've closed the x-files . there 's procedure to be followed here . protocol .
what do you say we call in a bomb threat for houston . i think it 's free beer night at the astrodome .
my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point . do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre ?
why not ? it 's charming . i mean , i do n't actually show concubines exposing their ! their ! it 's not indecent ! it 's highly moral , majesty . it 's full of proper german virtues . i swear it . absolutely !

got to . gondorff 's ridin ' the mark in from new york on the century .
doctor weir , my crew is not going on your mission because we want to . we were pulled off a well deserved leave , to be sent out to the middle of nowhere , and no one 's even told us why .
i 've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space .
no . i think i 'll stay right here in hell .
kind of a bleak point of view there , is n't it marty ?
i 'm sorry , i thought he would give it to you .
i must have the breakdown now . where is berthier ?
put me on the payroll , find out , find out wassup --
you do n't just sign up to be a police officer -- it 's about three years of training -- ok ?
i 'm not a podiatrist , i 'm a cardiologist .
who cares ? rose , tell him we have an arrangement .
no thank you sister . six ? ! ! that seems a little light . cops are watching betty , watching her hard . we need at least twenty men . and that 's twenty armed panthers dig ? you do have guns do n't you ?
i assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are . we 'll be prepared .
i have to go back . . .to the fortress . . .
but what can you do ? there 's no way now . . .
it goes beyond that . it praises the goodness of god and the greatness of all his works .
i hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow i doubt it -- the time is out of tune .
gardner ? oh , um -- he 's a new student . just moved here . why ?
his teacher brought him in to see me . said he 'd been acting up in class . creating a disturbance . i could n't get a thing out of him .
i 'm glad it 's you and not donovan .
he means well . he 's really brilliant and all .
wow , that is one moving story . take it easy on my heart strings . now i really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison .
poison ? i 'm surprised at you . you lack vision , mr. o'brien .
he was the only one of my bunch that was my friend ... he was loyal , went all the way for you ...
in all due respect , he sounds kind of pathetic to me . the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend . have you two ace detectives checked that out ?
it 's all circuits ... must be an input/output component ...
the tower , yes -- flynn , have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you 're from ?
i was , uh , just getting ready to leave ...
yo , jumbo . we got us some kind of < u > ventriloquist < /u > here .
bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
they can always grab oranges off trees . this you ca n't do in times square ...
i would n't say that -- what would you like to have for diner ? there 's onion soup and canned asparagus --
i really ought to be getting home . my family will be flipping by now .
they 've turned off the ventilation system . they 're calling him to dinner .
let 's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres .
i 'm thinking about painting the kitchen . what color do you like , will ? are you there ?
yeah . ah ... yellow , let 's paint it yellow .

she was never a suspect lloyd . some animal must have done this .
i checked all the zoos . no missing animals . you think a pitbull ?
but , rose , what is the cause of it all ?
promise not to tell doll ? -- or nobody ? buddy , it 's your daddy ! i 'm so much in love with him i am out of my mind !
i used to have one , but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it . i 'd just as soon not have one anyway . i hate those damn things .
but then you do n't get to watch the ball games . you told me you were a mets fan .
jackie did n't trust melanie . she 'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her , split the half million amongst themselves . what she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money .
lift up your pant leg . you help her ?
what ? not < u > the < /u > bible ?
well , that 's not really the name , but we always called it that .
i could have done it better . i 'm a fucking ball-buster i am .
you never walked away dad . you could have walked away .
you want to do this by yourself ? how ? you ca n't take care of pilgrim all the --
he 'll be sedated . i know horses , robert . i 'm the one who taught grace how to ride .

i 'll get wally to show me sometime then .
now , hold on a minute , young man ! hold on ! that 's rather big talk ! i started the john doe clubs with my money and i 'll decide whether or not they 're being properly used !
no you wo n't ! you 're through deciding anything !
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to do that ... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
what in the world would give me that idea ?
permanently disrupted ? are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has n't this 'incident ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?
look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?
what are you doing ? we 're not done . i just need to find the thing ...
if you do n't want to have a session today , it 's okay .
you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most !
perfectly innocent ! man have been hanged for less ! i 'm lied to , attacked behind my back , accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were holy gospel !
well , the light caught the side of his face for a second . and it looked like he had a gray beard , maybe ... late fifties , early sixties .
so you 're telling me it was one guy with six guns ? a-and he was a senior fucking citizen ?
yes , i know . my first concern is to locate the lucky man . when i do , it 's your job to keep the newspapers away from him .
it 's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in .
i am . i 'm wakin ' her up right now .
you 're stoned . you 're a junkie . get out of here .
i think i 've seen this nut somewhere . have n't i ?
if you do n't know what you 've seen , why should i ?
why else you think he wo n't tell us where the sit down is ?
it 's not a 'sit down . ' he said he 's telling us the plan .
i hope she 's all right . how much more do i have to do of this ?
till it 's in a powder . the energy exits within you ...
i < u > am < /u > sure . look , murders aside , riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame . he loves the jaw-jackin ' , loves making you afraid , 'cuz that 's all he has . and you 're playing right into --
< u > we 're gon na find the body < /u > , johns . christ , you 're a cop . why am i tellin ' you this ? we got ta go down and find it .
yes , there 's no doubt of that ... just look out of the window and there it is .
and it 's great ! think what it was a few years ago and what it is now .
you seem to understand the question , now how about answering it ?
hans hinkel was in the ministry of culture ; how could i know such a man ? i
i hate to see any man swing . bad luck .
bad luck for me . now i got ta bust him out of there .
there always one kid with no bodily controls . we had this dude , jeff baxter , he was a puker . the fucker would just sit there puke all over himself .
better than pissing ... anyway so , what 's your choice ?
okay , what is it ? you want a ride ?
never . i get air-sick . you would n't like that .
wait till summer . i swear , you ca n't leave the house . it hurts . it physically hurts .
i ca n't wait till i actually get to touch one of them .
taking forever . i just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before monday . i do n't know how i 'm going to do it .
well , it 's good that you 're there .
it means the nsa can read the time off your wristwatch .
why are they after < u > me < /u > ?
i thought she 'd get a kick out of it .
it was a harmless little prank . who in the world would 've thought she 'd spend her life waiting for this guy ?
i 'm sure you 'll excuse me if i am not gracious , but you see , major strasser , i 'm a czechoslovakian .
you were a czechoslovakian . now you are a subject of the german reich !
it 'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet .
talk english . how do i know you 're you ?
you 're crazy carryin ' that kinda money in this neighborhood . no wonder you got hit .
thanks . i 'm obliged to ya , but i got ta get goin ' .
i told you  i 'm your guardian angel . i know everything about you .
well , you look about like the kind of an angel i 'd get . sort of a fallen angel , are n't you ? what happened to your wings ?
i do n't think so , thea . he has spoken of your mother . i do n't believe he knows you are his daughter .
then why does he persecute me ? my family told me what kind of man he is , how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
meet and greet . `` i flash you some of mine , you flash me some of yours ? ''
and the deal goes down at another place at another time .
i ai n't tellin ' you nothin ' ! get me santino .
you 're a very stubborn man , mr. valiant . very pig-headed . boys , show mr. valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the toontown station ...
... the archdiocese called up , they said who was our attorney , 'cause the case is coming to trial ...
i doubt we 'll have to go to trial ...
an empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you , tappy head , you ai n't worth the salt you put in greens .
speaking of tappy heads , we ought to have an old fashion fish fry .
your family still carries the name corleone , and you will run it like a corleone !
and while i feed my family in new york , you put the knife in my back in miami .
no do n't . you could lose me for good . do n't go through that tunnel .
i 'm in traffic . there 's no place to turn .
you do n't want to know , believe me . but do n't worry , i washed my hands ...
a fucking c.d . wow , this case is closed . so , she 's got bad taste in music and in men ... did i tell you she and johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it ?
... ? this is wrong . who are you ? why are you doing this ?
i 'm not doing anything . look , i do n't know what 's going on . but i swear on my life , i '' m here at your old desk , on your ham , in our house , right now ... in .
i think it 's a gun pressing against my dick .
you thought right ... now take your hands from around my throat , nigga .
the bachelor party 's upstairs . they made me get naked . they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down ...
take hold of yourself . what room are they in ?
other people always know so much more than we know -- so much more than they 're willing to tell us .
it was clarendon . he knew i had the gun in my bag .
i guess ... but you know ... i 'm american and i 've mostly been taught to be competitive ... there 's always pleasure of being the best ?
maybe on earth there is one ... but not when you dive ... you see , to dive deep into the sea , for no reason ... just to do it . it 's a feeling ... i do n't know how to say this ... voluptuous ?
you 're right . i do n't give a damn about her . but to fuck a man 's wife behind his back ? that just makes a fool out of him . i do n't like being made a fool of .
i do n't blame you . what man would ? i admit it , okay ? i came back here and i made it with grace . but if you kill me you 're making a big mistake .
it looks ... er , delicious ... such a fine bouquet ... very aromatic ...
are ye afraid of me wine ? did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the wee folk ? think if ye sup with the faeries you 'll be enchanted ?
yeah . i 'm surprised . it 's really old ... travels well though . you know , the world looks a lot better from up here .
the world is fantastic . it 's the ultimate absurd circus . i am shot from a cannon into the energy .
so i hear . even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .
do n't worry , eddie , no one knows i 'm here .
c'mon , mommy , do n't start with that i 'm an ungrateful son stuff .
i said no such thing . all i said is that something must be wrong .
oh , yes . yes , of course dr. von holler . very interesting .
it reminds me very much of this one . nicht wahr ?
i would be interested to know what we are talking about .
unity , captain ! tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people . federation and romulan . human and vulcan and klingon and reman . i 'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same . we want peace .
- - which is called a gizzard , and it helps them mash their food , but what happens after a while - -
- - what happens is that after a while , the stones get smooth , every six weeks , so the animal regurgitates them - -
i 'm sorry , sir , i 'm only a 'droid , ' and not very knowledgeable of such things ... not on this system anyway . as a matter of fact , i 'm not even sure which system we 're on .
that 's all right . there is nothing anyone can do about it . you can call me luke .
why ca n't i go out to your folks ' house ? give me one good reason .
i have to see how things are first . my father 's sick , you understand ? they would n't be prepared for me bringing anyone .
that makes his birth sign ... virgo ! why that 's the sign of a little girl ! can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with emperor commodus ?
proximo , we need to talk about my one third ... i imagine the betting booths will be doing good business . and , what was the name of that olive oil company ?
not much . nothing at all in this sector .
find me something , i do n't care where it is .
this piece of puke hired me to kill you , baby . do you believe that ? is n't that right , tran ? you pinhead .
oh my god . i do n't believe this is happening .
you assemble this , on the instant , from these few observations ?
i 'm a historian . it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious .
the area 's wired for surveillance , they 'll be < u > looking < /u > for those moves .
well how do < u > i < /u > know what they 're --
it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it , and i 'd just disappear and they 'd never see me again .
sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems .
i 'm sorry about that -- but i had nothing to do with it .
that does n't mean you do n't know what 's going on . you 're connected to this guy somehow . he 's after you -- just like the others were .
hello . i 'm peter venkman . may i help you ?
yes ... well ... i 'm not sure . what i have to say may sound a little ... unusual .
why do n't we let juno go home and we can discuss this later on , okay ?
it all just happened so fast . we put that ad in the paper . i thought it would take months if , you know , ever and then -- boom -- two weeks later , she 's in our living room .
oh my god ! louise ! look ! look ! see if that 's him !
it 's him . he 's got california plates . it 's the same guy .
you do n't have to get uppity with me , bill . i remember when you was running that car wash and could n't make it go . and what was that other thing you tried ? a dairy queen ? went busted too .
at least i improved myself . what 's up ?
it 's here you said that you closed the deal with him ?
yes , mr. webster -- it was here where it all began .
broke a got to go . april deros man . california this summer . waves are good they tell me , surfin 's gon na be good ...
march man in tennessee , sniff the pines ... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin ' down by the river . what you got taylor ? let 's see three hundred and what ?
we 're on vapor , cougar , you got to put it down .
it 's crazy , man . instruments are crazy . we 're gon na have to eject .
styles could n't reassign him , he 's a legend --
you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by . it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass , and you know what ? he deserved it . there 's your confession .
so the truth is more important to you than your life ?
i do n't care about my life . but if i 'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself ?
what of ? look , i would n't do it unless i was . i 'm dead lucky 'cos i get paid for doing something i love doing .
i 'd appreciate it if you did n't go around telling people lies about me .
right . i 'm sorry . you 've got a reputation to think about .
kelly ... relax . take one of your mom 's valium or something . in another week you get on the plane . it 's over . we 're rich .
but what if they find out ... god , they 'd put you in the gas chamber ...
i was lucky in the order . i always been lucky killin ' folks .
who was next ? clyde ? or was it ... ?
mixed emotions , buddy : like larry wildman going off a cliff in my new maserati . men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines , fuel could go up , unions are killers ...
yeah are n't you forgetting something gordon : rule one , capital reserves . this company has $ million cash in an overfunded pension . that buys us a lot of credibility ... ... and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker ...
this 'll pass . everybody thinks like this now and then . come to bed .
i think i 'm going to stay up for a while .
roger really . people say i talk too much .
yeah , i was gon na tell you to shut up .
yeah . i mean for months i 've been seeing you with ray you being his girlfriend and i kept wishing you were my girlfriend ... but , you know , what could i do ?
me too . i mean i 'm going out with ray and i 'm ... thinking about you .
you never said this lednov 's name before , that i can remember .
no call to . that jail looked pretty solid to me . how 's she feel ?
he wants to know if you killed freddie miles and then killed dickie greenleaf ?
no i did not . i did not kill freddie miles and then kill dickie greenleaf . is he accusing me ? ask him if he 's accusing me !
well , you should n't worry about him too much , david .
what do i tell my mama when i get home ? i did n't find him and that 's what i wanted to do .
mr. barboni is a good customer . works for jimmy capp .
i know who he works for . where 's your phone .
no . no , it 's ok. i ... it 's my father .
oh , right . did he used to ... ?
yeah . so the idea is that ... you buy these glasses for your infant , and they wear them at night when they sleep .
and inside these glasses are these slide photographs . and each photograph is of something peaceful ... or beautiful . whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside .
listen , it 's one thing to have a guilt complex . but i know the difference between when i 'm overstrung and when i 'm seeing things that are simply not there ! besides , it only began after we moved !
there is , of course , another possible explanation which i dearly hope is not the case .
what will i tell the others ? they care about you .
tell them anything you want . tell them i 'm on a vacation , a business trip . tell them i needed a rest . tell them anything , just do n't tell them ...
we got everything we need . plenty of food . ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it ...
what do you want from me ? ! whatever you gon na do to me , just do it ! and let me go !
you ask that of me ? you 're afraid to live in your coffin . you know what that means ?
that 's superstition . that 's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - i 'm talking of something else -- cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real .
i did . do i have to eat lamb ? daddy did n't cook it , she did .
do me a favor ? eat it , and then give me a secret report , okay ? pay particular attention to whether it 's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup .
jeeze , it 's great you came along , mike ... you know , we 've never spent a night out on the town together . i always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time .
i never looked down on you , fredo . you do n't look down at a brother .
it 's happened before . remember lieutenant orpheus ? he disappeared into that underworld series and never came back .
sounds like my husband . he never came back either . at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break .
good . and one more thing . i think your `` written , directed , and starring ed wood '' credit is a bad idea .
why ? ! i did all those things ! hell , i even built the props .
he said he wished the two of you could start over , live a normal life .
huh . problem is , jack 's idea of a normal life is robbing banks . it 's all he 's ever done .
not just kids - - for everyone . we 're going to open next year . unless the lawyers kill me first . i do n't care for lawyers . you ?
i , uh , do n't really know any . we - -
oh , by the way -- i 'm out of cash --
did n't you take your cut out of the closing check ?
good . well , i 'll be seeing you .
i 'm glad they did n't hold you downtown .
so , you know the lengths he 'll go to keep her from going public ... i 'm turning lauren over to canadian law enforcement tomorrow . they 'll put her in witness protection , but if you 're with her the risk of her safety goes way down .
i did n't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention .
i do n't need a geography lesson , luthor .
no , superman , of course not . you do get around , do n't you .
he said you 're quite chubby . and you have a nervous tick .
he said that ? what else did he say ?
i gave you that tongue and i can rip it out !
no , i really like my tongue ... we 're very attached . oyyyy ... okay , now ... promise you wo n't get angry .
yes , thats it ... yes , we went to high school together .
you never really talked to me . i wanted to talk to you , man ...
frank , you do n't listen ! j.j. just told you to shut your mouth !
do n't you think it 's about time you shut yours ? who are you to tell a man like frank d'angelo to shut up ? !
no i 'm not okay ! i do n't know what the hell i 'm doing !
you 're doing fine . i wo n't let anything happen to you , remember ?
well , you know , i-i-i ... you know , if you want me to , i 'll read it .
oh , gosh , i do n't know . well , could i come over tomorrow and read it to you ?
... he lied to us . he left us down here .
c'mon , beth . do n't make this personal . he told me himself they were taking us back .
look ... i tell you , you do n't think i 'm blind , do you ?
yes . where were you when you saw him first ?
that was in style a couple years back , man .
right . if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping , then you 're all set .
sure . but that 's only when the love itself goes unchanged .
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there 's change in the two people who share that love .
careful , captain , they 've been known to charge .
all right i got a little surprise for you --
we are n't going to have a war . we 're going to have the `` appearance '' of a war .
i 'm not sure we can afford to have the `` appearance '' of a war .
major adamson , i ca n't seem to get in the door .
laurie , i 'll have to ask you to come with me .
it 's a joke . maneuver up to carl 's boat ? tie your lines fast ? come aboard ? all against carl 's will ? it 's the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of .
i 'm sorry about that . it was n't mine in the first place .
ok. this is what you get when you 're a pervert -- you said you 'd help someone out and you did n't so we 're just getting some money for her and that 's that .
you know , please , i just wan na say that i did n't say i would help her out ; i was very clear about it ... .i do n't think that this is fair ... ..wait , wait , wait , ouch , ouch ... ..
< u > kill < /u > you ! he 's coming to kill you !
if this is a joke , it 's not funny .
what problems does he have , sean , that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with --
why do you think he does that , gerry ?
all she needed for that was the phone book !
no , no . she said not to call , her husband might answer .
but he 's seven . what kind of stress can he have ?
plenty . who knows ? maybe he 's got severe coping problems about not having a father . did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend 's dad .
okay . i 'll think about that . bye .
you really should . life , after all , is really just a series of challenges ...
ahhh ... i 'm afraid i 've got a prior commitment .
next time then . we perambulate here most every night .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
the nicholson node . i suppose you have n't heard of that either .
green eggs and ham . you 're not going to get anywhere . you might as well put me in the cage .
you are in the cage , o'neil . right here , right now .
hold on a minute , lowell ... ... somebody ... may be following me . i do n't know . they came on the property ...
what do you mean followed you ? did you call the police ?
do you mind . this is like the most important moment of my whole life .
forget it jen , i 've waited a year for this .
the law 's on our side . if they want to challenge it , let them try .
they must 've scuttled it . nobody just lets a ship float away .
so what 'll you do ? after they give you the gold watch .
hell , i got a gold watch ... it just do n't work . maybe they 'll give me a new fishing pole , or something useful .
these ladies are n't starvin ' to death . they make minimum wage . when i worked for minimum wage , i was n't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy .
ahh , now we 're getting down to it . it 's not just that he 's a cheap bastard -
i say we make him pay first . after that you can do whatever you want to him .
he 's right . do you have any idea what van gogh 's `` vase with twelve sunflowers '' is worth ?
snapped . buffy was , you know , on the upswing , and i swear to god she went across the room . perm over heels .
oh , my god ! ouch ! no wonder you quit .
all i 'm saying is that if you 're unhappy you should leave .
i 'm not even supposed to be here today !
you went there ? i 've wanted to go there , but i thought it was off limits .
it is . but that did n't stop me . should n't stop you .
hey , man . good to see you . what 'll it be today ?
two tins of schimmelpennincks . and throw in a lighter while you 're at it .
it 's on the twine , too . but it 's not r ...
do n't prove there was two lanterns . coulda been the one in the cabin .
preach ! go down and get me some white tavern whisky , a glass , and some ice .
preacher ! go on down and get me some bourbon . j. t. s. brown . no ice , no glass .

the test is this monday ! megatons ... let 's see , we need rads ... you 'd have to be ... exactly yards from ground zero ... you realize that what we 're going to do could be extremely dangerous .
believe me , professor , running around on a nuclear test site ca n't be any more dangerous than what i 've been doing .
no , you should n't have , it was needlessly cruel . she thinks she has cancer and is going to die .
she 's an adult , mrs. hillyer , i was merely giving her the facts .
i had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on . when i say i do n't want to get married , i mean just that . i do n't want to marry anybody . not for years .
so who 's asking ? i do n't want to marry you .
i think that you 're lying . i think you know exactly where the money is .
you 're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself ... and it 's not working . i said i 'd tell you everything i know . you and your friends behind the mirror .

you better get in there with her until this thing is over .
well , i do n't know ... i just tried to run this program i 've been working on , and i was denied access all of a sudden . i thought maybe i 'd been laid off and nobody told me .

i hope luke made it to the fleet all right .
luke ! i 'm sure he 's fine . probably sitting around wondering what we 're doing right now .
it was not . the barrier stood between us - but we breached it .
magnificent . you are the first to find me .
i love that youre asking questions , but do you really want to get into all of this ?
this is awkward for me . talking about it makes me feel better .
c.d.s . the music kind . from the grendel label .
without grendel knowing about it . b-i-n-g-o and bingo was his name-o . counterfeit c.d.s . tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy , the sound quality 's better , and so 's the money .
well ... my home `` sector '' was called paramus ...
paramus ... wonder what those initials stand for ... ... probably program assist routine -- well , it sounds like a lovely place .
hey gus -- did you see the story idea i left on your desk ?

it 's a good thing you pay me well .
do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now ? your phones are almost certainly tapped . and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist , who may be a --
well then somebody 's just going to have to go out there . take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually .
oh , right ! right ! with those things running around . no way .
i would have tried to show her a good time . i promised her when she left that i would never forget her and i never did . stanley rosenfeld does not forget .
this is the street he walks down every day . when he needs inspiration ...
tch ... how romantic . yeah . if i was n't already committed to lydia , boy . except anne 'd never go for me though . she loves you too much . and you really love her , huh ?
no . but that 's not the only reason people get together or..stay together .
your uncle milton lost all his money in a puerto rican condominium that went belly up , do n't mention the irs or the federal prison system . your mother is barbara , your father is cliff --
i hope he does n't get out his slides .

it was an old car -- those dents could have been there forever .
there 's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars : the ones that ca n't afford new ones , and the ones who would n't give 'em up for anything in the world . that second bunch do n't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents .
this is great . and it 's yours ? you like own it ?
the bank owns it . but i 'm working on it .
what 's the matter with him . i never saw nick act like that before .
you 'll see a lot of strange things from now on .
what do you mean , `` all of us ? ''
you did n't think it was just going to be you and me ? a lot of people believed in nix . they have n't forgotten his promise .
a kiss under the mistletoe . mistletoe can be deadly , if you eat it ...
but a kiss can be even deadlier , if you mean ... it .

maybe it 's not going to be so easy . from what i 've heard , mrs. teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t. firefly .
that 's where you come in . i 'll leave him in your hands , and do n't forget you 're supposed to be my niece .
nope . hey , you think i 'll win scariest costume ?
linda , you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus .
he does n't get it . held never understand what we 're trying to accomplish here . it 's too dangerous for him .
well , in reality it 's not that dangerous , bob . it 's only dangerous if you do n't know what you 're doing .
to look ... look for a place ... a place to live in ... an empty place ... a ... new ... place ...
how did you know we were on this island ? do others know ? will others come ?
no . do n't be silly . it 's just ...
i am a foolish little thing . i am pink in my face , no ? it is only that i have been so lonely lately and ... i am ashamed . i 'll see you tomorrow , okay ? unless ... am i fired now ?
i ca n't read any more crap . these women are all victims .
yes , that 's what we 're looking for .
if you do n't like them , why wo n't you be more concrete with me ?
because the press stinks too -- history on the run , that 's all you 're interested in . you come up with anything ?
well , it 's not good enough . just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you , kit ? guy like you .
she 'd get along okay . and if she did n't , well , she could take off , just take off , i would n't mind ... i 'd always tell people i deserved it .
it used to be serious -- at least i was -- but he was n't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt .
well , in that case , could n't you -- ?
that 's ridiculous . i 've been coming here for years . listen to me . i 'm going out of my fucking mind here . i need to see him .
if this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers . there 's about an hour 's wait . i 'll be glad to take your name . why do n't you just fill out this form ?
this is bad , joe . the prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists . they 'll argue exactly the opposite . they 'll say he 's just pretending to be catatonic and he 's completely sane .
great . battling head doctors . we 'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt . hung jury .
please , sir , do n't kick my ass ! i 'll do anything to get out of a beating !

i presume you shall . this wo n't be my last visit here .
i want to speak to you alone . i saw something . i heard .
sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way , i 'm afraid of him .
do n't let it trouble you . he 's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him . he wo n't harm you .
does burgess know about this ? about the minority report ?
i used to joke with lamar that we were the mother and father of precrime . well , in my experience , parents often see their children as they want them to be , not as they are .
... wow ... .wow ! hey , ms. jenzen -- ?
are you still fucking < b > here < /b > ? ?
it 's you i want to talk to , bill .

he shot the chancellor 's dog , did n't he ? the blind one .

you would n't hit a girl , would you ?
omgs , mongols , nazi low-riders , prison gangs ?
nlr , we think . i wan na know ...
i do n't know who this mr. dyle is , but it 's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband .
you mean he might have -- mr. bartholomew , i 'm catching the next plane out of here -- i 'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me !
i was upstairs for a meeting . i 've been hearing good things about you .

buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy . we have compassion for all people .

i do n't believe this ... all that gore you paint in the comics and you 're squeamish ?
lots of fires . they promote faster there . take a look at the last lt. 's list , half the guys on it came from that battalion . got ta think about your future , timmy . 's the station .

do n't judge me . you 're a joke , coming here from a fucked-up culture , telling us what to do !
yeah , it is fucked up -- but it 's not too late to keep that from happening here .
like it 's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry . and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier . so let 's get on with it . he 's still in sydney ?
dr. vladimir nekhorvich is dead . so is his colleague , gradski , but that happened earlier . we had nekhorvich on a flight from sydney that crashed in the rockies..
not this weekend , sweetie , she 's runnin ' away with me . hi . what 'd he say ?
what time are you gon na pick me up ?
it 's terrible -- you just made it up .
well , the idea 's right , anyway . are you going to call me ?
what was i supposed to do ? i told the truth . why should the truth upset you ? it 's not as if you 're from a convent .
i want my fucking money . i 'm getting out of here . i do n't want anything more to do with you .
one question , doctor , please ! you ca n't do this ! i 'm the press , i have rights ! !
that 's right , you have the right to remain silent .
i always wanted it to be at a time when ... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be .
yeah . and right now there 's some fat guy over there watching us .
i took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests .
this is general nikolas pherides , commander of the third army . i 'm oliver davis . to be perfectly frank with you , we did n't expect to find anyone living here .
and why do you always refer to yourself in the third person , like napoleon ? how come it always turns into an argument with you ?
look , i 've got the hair , got the eyes , got the teeth , i got the car . i 'm the lead singer , i 'm the man .
-- when you say forty-five minutes or an hour , do you mean continuous time ? just continually , without stopping ?
-- well -- not going in and out , i do n't mean just that . why are you asking me ? you went with george longer than i have .
now if i got you correctly , there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice .
the flashback in the courtroom , when she tells about being a school teacher .
could you wait a little while , this key may not fit .
i wish you would n't do this . it does n't make any sense . let 's go somewhere and have some coffee .
it 's fine . it 's done . basically . i 'm just sort of ... tinkering with it .
great . i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend . think that might be possible ?
do n't you dare ask me that question . i 'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that !

okay . just remember that . now beat it .
oh , thanks , thanks , mister . i always knew you guys were kind-hearted .
barbara < u > zelman < /u > ? i do n't believe this !
do you usually pay for charlie ? at `` trattoria < u > valentino < /u > '' ?
it was dad , i swear , dressed like a homeless man . and you know what else was really strange ? a businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus .
about time they started cleaning up the trash downtown . we do n't want to end up like the rest of the country .
that 's what i 'm trying to tell you . we must n't do anything about it . believe me , tom , i know what i 'm talking about .
he 's a menace to the whole world ! it 's our duty to turn him in .
do n't mind him , chucky . you 're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of vaseline .
screw you , valentino . i have n't seen you swapping spit with anybody .
yeah , all right , do n't tell me , i 'll go along with it , it 's just irritating to me i ca n't figure it out .
all you have to do is tell me what it 's worth to you . what 's a person worth to you .
they 're called pilots ! i 'm serious , ray . i 'm not in the mood for one of your stupid , fucked-up plans right now .
i do n't see you coming up with any plans .
enid and i were just friends . you know ... we feel comfortable around each other ... she really likes my old records and ...
i ca n't believe this ! i thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me !
reggie -- i think i 've found -- are you on ?
no , it 's all right . what 's wrong , adam ?
why not ? you went farther than that last time .

you 'd make it . he 's just getting to the girls . come on , zack . i got ta see my family , man . i could n't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend .
sorry , pard . would n't want you to get an honor violation .

trust me . you do trust me , do n't you ?
i only enjoy acting for myself . i hate it when other people are let in .
why ? i mean , which are you , scared or selfish ?
this here money , take my share an ' ned 's an ' leave it with my youngsters . tell 'em half goes to sally two trees if i ai n't back in a week . the rest is yours ... you could buy them spectacles .
are you ... are you gon na ... kill little bill ?
like those cousteau specials on television ? i think it 's for the kids , but i love them .
better than cousteau , or compagno with computers , telemetry , defense department funding ...
you let me believe you . you knew you were guilty , and you let me become a part of it . god , how ... how could you ...
alright , alright . go ahead . when i 'm old , give me someone like me , but go ahead .
his criminal career has officially come to a close ...
the conundrum still applies , of course . the purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime . however . this can not be successfully carried out without baby brother 's considerable resources , shabby though they may be .
we have a pregnant woman out there -- -- relax , she 's not due for two weeks , but a marble floor is n't doing her back any good . i 'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there 's a sofa .

i 've never heard the flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that . you 're funny .
i can not leave alone a soul in pain .
do you know who i am ? you never heard of me , did you ?
you do n't think much of yourself , do you ?
well , that 's a funny thing to say .
he will not permit anyone but me to see him . you must be outside this room ... . do what you can .
i am your truthsayer , my lord ... he is here , my lord .
-- and god the angry parent , and the spirit the hope of an integrated adult self .
all well and good -- but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in ?
wait ! ... i respect what you said . but remember , these men have lands , castles . much to risk .
and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield , does he risk less ?
you hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you .
or maybe ... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos ? maybe that 's why we spend so much time together .
fine . the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man .
how did your relationship with miss lawson progress after the surgery ?

fine . i was making time with your girl . now i 'm scared to death and i learned my lesson . now can you go away ?
plenty . who knows ? maybe he 's got severe coping problems about not having a father . did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend 's dad .
come on , i doubt the answer 's that simple .
well , you know how it is -- things pile up .
mr. vanderhof , in public relations , and mr. eichelberger , in mortgage and loan -- they 'd both like to have you transferred to their departments .
yeah , you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad , huh ?
this is n't a comic book store , right . it 's a bakery .
we 're going to register . as man and wife . and get shown to a cabin ... and then search every inch of that place , inside and ... outside .
you wo n't believe it ... but this will be the first time i 've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers !
come on , barney , you and me live in the real world . you do n't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady , mr. thomas .
certain ladies make that very easy ... vivian . john , call a limousine for our guest , please . have it take her anywhere she wishes to go . bill the hotel . see you again sometime soon .
but she 's a member of the twelve families . how can they hold her ?
these are doubtful times . the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the ...
when you and i use to attend rallies in college , we helped to create awareness . but from the inside now i can actually effect change . i never lost my idealism .

i do n't care how ! think of a way . think of something .
can i ask you a question ? if he 's so troubled , why are you letting him out ? what if he does it again ? it happens all the time .
he 's free . his time 's up . that 's the rules . he 's been treated and reevaluated . he does n't show any signs any more .
mathilda ... there 's equally a lot of other things !
huh , really ? what ? come on , i 'm waiting !

i do n't know about that i do n't have any money i do n't have any attorneys gus is my only real friend .
maybe - just 'maybe ' - when their ship does n't return - they 'll decide not to come here , after all .
but if they < u > do < /u > ?
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days , rolfe , and some night i 'm going to bite back . i swear it .

hey . could you be a little more insensitive ? we 're on our way to a funeral for crissake .
yeah . our own . i do n't see why we got to go along for the ride .
i am thrilled for you , but tell me this ... how 'd you get howard to do it ? i 've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion , but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea .
it was his idea . it was a gesture of love and trust . be happy for me , miles .
now remember , do n't tell anybody we saw the terrance and phillip movie !
yeah , let 's swear we wo n't tell !
it seems your department does n't believe out new unit is to the public benefit .
a humanoid robot is like any other machine , it can be a benefit or a hazard . if it 's a benefit , it 's not our problem .
nick , what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn < u > doctor < /u > .
jesus , you do n't think i know that ? you do n't think i 've tried ? she wo n't fucking < u > go < /u > -- she wo n't leave this place .
train goes at four minutes past twelve . you 've just got time .
that 's very kind of somebody . who do i have to thank ? what happens if i miss the train ?
get your dick back here . it has everything to do with you .
you 're such a ball-breaker sometimes . especially at night .
they will come after me . but i can collect some stool samples , for dna with that , nick 's tapes , and the rest of you to back me up , it should stand when we get back .
then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back . i 'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now . this expedition is over .
good . this thing 's on track , looks like it 's gon na get done .
fuckin ' thrilled t'hear it . so the scout , the sitdown , y'musta felt it from 'em then huh ?
that was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes . he 's loose . he 's out of control . it 's very clear what needs to happen . i have work to do .
what if he < u > is < /u > working for someone else ? what if he turned ?
you < u > have < /u > to get out of here !
that 's what i 'm here for -- to get out ! i want to get away from here , from you -- as fast as i can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me . sixty-five , ninety-four --

now , wait fellows -- great heavens . i 've got to see those angry committees first -- feel them out a little -- work for harmony -- harmony .
did n't you hear stoltzfus ? what if he dies ? then the sheriff will come . they 'll say we broke their laws 
we 'll pray that he does n't die ! but if he does , then we 'll find a way so no one knows !
should n't somebody like , stand guard or something -- just in case ?
i 'll stay , if it 'll ease your mind .

next time he calls tell mr gluck he better be there to take his calls at tonight or at in the morning if he cares about his puppies . got that ?
that 's shiva ? what 's he giving the priest ?
legend says he told sankara to go forth and combat evil . to do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers .
you know , i could just as well go without seeing him today .
what ! after giving us such a run around ...
i do n't feel so well . have you seen telly anywhere ?
telly is at steven 's . there 's a bunch of people over there . come on dance .
i put an ad on a computer bulletin board . i log on at the library so i ca n't be traced .
well , i 've been tracking them down all morning .
it 's too late . i 've already ruined my life .
you will survive this ... donald . i promise you that you will survive . you must let me help you . and when i clap my hands together , you will wake up .
what ? come on . she 's got a good thing with victor --
i 'm sorry , did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws ?
alan , i want to tell you that i 'm so sorry about the ...
billy , i ca n't talk to you now .
well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance . do n't take me wrong but you ca n't judge people by how you act . you 're a caring person .
he should be caring . that is not too much to ask .
we know the tooth fairy reads the tattler . the stuff about me and lector ? i do n't know any other paper that carried it ...
... there 's three 't 's ' and an 'r ' in tattler .
well , that 's interesting . wh-what kind of stuff ?
oh ... well , you-you 're not interested in this .
yeah , i 'm hungry too . i know of a place . let 's go eat .
yeah , i want mandolins , flowers ... they move off down the corridor .
he told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was . he made eagle scout when he was twenty-nine years old . oh , norbert -- promise me that paul has not gone into the park !
if you warned him against it as much as you say , it 's almost a certainty .
colonel munro , i have known you as a gallant antagonist . i am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend .
and i to make yours , monsieur le marquis .
work ! do n't say that word , man .
man , i hate work even when somebody else does it !
fine . or it was until a couple of days ago . a guy from the new york times called and asked me to write a christmas story . they want to publish it on christmas day .
that 's a feather in your cap , man . the paper of record .
summer would have been a lot less without you . you 're a true friend , donald .
was there a night that i got really drunk and declared that i never loved anyone as much as i loved you ?
i have no defense . so far as i know -- it is true .
you ca n't believe that . you do n't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad . you 're not vicious or cruel , paul .
took no chances , did he ? and when you got there , he pushed her off the tower , was that it ? but you were the one who screamed . why did you scream ?
i wanted to stop it , i ran up to stop it --
this is serious ! i do n't have my license . he was my ride .
i 'm sorry . i 'm just here to shower .
you 're making a < u > career < /u > decision here , i would < u > strongly < /u > sugg ...
duncan . i 've got an < u > even < /u > < u > better < /u > idea ...
damn , she musta hot wired it . we picked up a professional car thief in the shape of olivia newton-john !
okay , i 'm just a little mad now ! jam , why 'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place ! ?
and who 's this susan when she 's at home ?
only susan campey , our resident teenager . you 'll have to love her . she 's your symbol .
good . the boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill .
that 's right and i 'll smash your face for you , yarblockos . slide of watch shop .
where is he ? talk -- or you 're dead . damn it , tell me ! tell me !
if you do n't let go , doctor jones , we 'll both die .

that 's what i deserve for listening in the first place .
i have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up .
you stay inside . i will see to them .
... i do n't play that ... i do n't play that so just try again . c'mon , riddick , tell me a better lie ... .
ease up , ease up . johns ! just tell me what ... .
it is shameful -- infamous ! i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador 's house .
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out , and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not .
- but you left before i could get there and i could check just so many places..
yeah , smaller countries do n't computerize customs records -
you 've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- now , who can i insult ? ... who do we owe money to ? ... ambassador trentino ! how about him ?
he's-a very easy to insult -- i say something to his niece once , and he slapped my face .
my daddy is dead so watch your mouth . you can say what you want about me , but do n't be dragging my daddy into it . this watch means the world to me . solid gold . keeps perfect time .
looks like a fake to me . loan denied !
this is his stuff . i 've been out in the cold all day .
this is a premeditated puzzle , and it 's only the beginning .
by the way , jeffrey , this story is n't going to the press and i 'm going to ask you to consider all you 've heard strictly confidential . do not discuss this business with anyone , but me , or other police personnel . got it ?
got it . thanks for letting me in on as much as you did .
< u > i < /u > think , here 's what i think : s'it gon na rain ... ?
gim me the weather for tomorrow morning , five a.m. andrews ...
oh yes , honey . getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over . smooth as a baby 's butt .
i love it , rose . i 'm getting to be a real girl .
for god 's sake , woman , i 'm just trying to keep you safe !
i will not hear any more about my safety ! ! you made me a promise and now you have broken it !
alright , alright . go ahead . when i 'm old , give me someone like me , but go ahead .
i trusted you . i stood up in court five years ago and i picked you .
do n't you want to know where i 'm going ?
no . yes , i want to know what for . but i do n't want to ask .
some of this native nonsense . the houngan has his prescription and dr. maxwell and i have ours .
you 've never said anything about voodoo before , mrs. rand .
i was with max when he got the call .
and you came all the way down here to see me ?
we get it at work . we get the magazine at work .
yes , we know that you do . i have it in my files . that 's at the manhattan health center ...
then why do you think i married frank ? i was already pregnant , and i did n't have much time . say what you like , but at least he gave my kid a name .
good old frank . and how is fat mr. grease monkey these days ?
she did it ! aimed the car right at mr. stubbins and mowed him down !
from what i understand , the eye- witness is a drug user .
the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since together with their questionnaires . major , what am i to tell dr. furtwängler ?
you tell him nothing , emmi . if he calls again , you say you know nothing . we 're gon na keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses . and , god help me , with beethoven .
well , dad asked me to ask you this , about the wedding . is there any chance you and kathryn will get married in amity ?
tell dad we 're getting married in las vegas . in one of those chapels . he can meet us there .
i was staying in character . `` egomaniacal sonofabitch ? ''
sense memory . i see you got to win the fight ...
you ca n't use that until neo is out !
i know , trinity . do n't worry . he 's going to make it .
she knows not to steal . i 've taught her better than that .
yeah , but you 're not her parents , anymore , you and helen . her parents are axl rose and madonna . the five minutes you spend a day with her ca n't compete with that kind of constant bombardment . you 're outgunned , amigo .
so -- mag -- you 've seen this , huh ?
yes , i 've seen it . and i have to say it 's the rudest and most offensive ... joke anybody 's ever played on me !
what 's this about , george ? i know that look .
there ! go back . down that side street .
i do n't know . he sent me . i 'm george .
oh , i see . george . well , that explains everything . open your mouth , george .
she said the frog came from around the copper ridge . she must 've been behind the hill .
what would you think if somebody told you a story like this ?
we write them down because sooner or later you 're going to remember something good .
i do remember something good . all the time . i remember you .
well , when i walked up the block , i ... well , my word !
that 's new york . it looks rundown , but it 's safe during the day . you 'll get used to it .
yeah , i hope you have , too . mickey i hope so for your sake , because , uh , your personality left something to be desired ...
yeah , and for yours . i 'm sure you 've changed .
what ? ! you 're calling me a stalker ?
that 's right -- if you were n't you would 've looked for her yourself !
the corleone family wants to buy me out . i buy you out . you do n't buy me out .
your casino loses money . maybe we can do better .
he 's not the same as when i met him .
if he were , he 'd be dead by now . you 'd be a widow . you 'd have no problem .
the police came to me for help . what could i do ?
you could have been honest with me for starters . we work together . i have to be able to trust you .
of course she knew ! for one thing , addison told her how superbly eve had read the part- ! karen , let me tell you about eve . she 's got everything - a born actress . sensitive , understanding , young , exciting , vibrant-
- do n't run out of adjectives , dear .
did n't you just see her lookin ' at him ? she told me no , but i do n't believe her .
c'mon , jake . you know she 's crazy about you .
yeah , i hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady 's place . watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous .
i know , that was some crazy shit . i never in a million years would have believed it if i had n't seen it .
candy ? hell no , billy , she 's just a good friend , that 's all ...
wu-wu-wu i-i-i-i th-th-think sh-sh sh-she 's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world !
you should n't be on your feet too much , you got weight you 're not used too . how 's the food down there ?
had dinner at a place called the king 's table . buffet style . it was pretty darn good .
how could there have been witnesses ? it was so dark . we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere ... i do n't understand what they 're talking about .
in time i 'm sure it will all come back to you .
who said it wa 's me , hub ? anyway ... he fell off a ladder . it was n't really my fault .
well , i got something.. pop-sweet 's accounting ledger for the disco-strip . all the money transactions . look ... someone 's putting their initials beside the weekly totals . like they 're acknowledging a deposit .
some , thanks . enough to move on , for now .
you should really let a doctor look at that .
it is n't the money . we 're after circulation . what we need is fireworks . people who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments .
oh , i can do that . i know this town inside out . oh , give me a chance , please .
he said something like , `` do you want it dirty7 '' or something . i tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor .
was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ?
there is no reason to assume other people were involved .
your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie ; they did n't need that to talk among themselves .
i can understand that . everyone feels that way about someone .
no . it 's not just how i felt toward jessica . i 've been cruel to even you .
it 's my response to the issue of a woman 's right to choose ... it 's something i feel super-strongly about .
is n't this a wonderful piece , class ? this definitely falls into that higher category of art i was speaking of earlier .
fancy some lunch after we_re through with this meccano shit ?
sure , i think it_s your turn to buy too .
no . we 're going to lock this up and --
stop it ! i want to read them ! if you do n't want to , then just leave . but do n't you push me around like i 'm some mule you paid for -- i already got a husband !
buddy , that was business . besides , you have more crew . then there 's you ...
i 'll get the money back , plus interest . i go on the grift for you . you get a cat , i get a cut . and we get square .
do n't tell me you really are in love ?
yeah and i got the bruises to prove it . so what ?
we are betraying the principles upon which the federation was founded ... this is an attack on the very soul of the federation . this will destroy the ba'ku . just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history .
we are only moving six hundred people , jean-luc .
that 's good . that 's uh ... good .
you always had a way with words . i should be getting back .
i thought we were going to try for a baby . is n't that enough of an adventure ?
that can wait . i want to get away . see some of the world . explore .
that 's stupid ! i happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy .
your mom is the tooth fairy ? that is so cool !
i know what i am . i do n't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder .
what are you saying ? that you do n't have sex with men ?
i 've got to hand it to the british , david . you know what those guys are ? decent . tell me , herr dr. furtwängler , do you know hans hinkel ?
yes , a despicable human being . he was in the ministry of culture . his job was to get rid of jews in the arts .
i 'll talk to her , and to dad , too . a few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they 'll be ours .
maybe if we had them both to dinner or something .
this is about the `` wanted ! '' posters , is n't it .
yes . i am obviously not standing out in people 's minds at the robberies .
ooh , that 's a pretty ring you 're wearing .
it 's a mood ring , it tells what mood i 'm in .
i did n't mean to say anything bad about you . i know you 're good . you did n't mean no harm . did you ever think about killin ' yourself on purpose like my daddy did ?
i 've studied about it . the bible says not to or you end up goin ' to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades .
that 's fine . i would n't expect you to see it any other way .
maybe you just need -- look , can you wait here a sec , i need to tidy up -- just a minute , i 'll be right back . you 'll wait ?
all right , it 's a matter of death .
death , death . how about the first thursday in march , ten o'clock .
general , do you realize what happened out there today ?
i did n't get killed and everyone else did .
a ring for my wife . a lot like that one . in fact , it was that one .
that 's no problem . we have those in stock .
we do n't have nothing sweet no more , baby .
not for me , you do n't ! you do n't let me eat the pies ...
well , the paper 'll have to learn to do without me . and so will you . it just did n't work out , walter .
it would have worked if you 'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter . but no ! you had to marry me and spoil everything .
i do n't know if you 're a detective or a pervert .
that 's for me to know and for you to find out . i 'll see you . i mean call you . okay ?
yes -- i had to pay the vet in full . he just would n't have treated the horse this time . after all , we ca n't very well do without a horse .
it 's all right , jabez . we 'll find something to pay stevens .
ed , we 're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant .
my pleasure , al ... always happy to help out in a pinch ... excuse me . i better call my service ... tell them where i am .
i saw it ... and do n't try to tell me it was aunt martha 's or lucy 's ...
you do n't remember it , but i remember . that was your mother 's scalp !
lovely . how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali ? zipping through my inheritance per usual ?
hopefully , though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid .
you ought to stop this nonsense , loretta , these two dollar bets .
it 's compensation , leo , for the marginal life we lead . sidney , did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
i had everybody working . even our old babysitter .
she 's beautiful . look at her . henry , look at her .
i bet you do n't sound like real people .
we do , you know . we sound like us having a ball . it 's fab .
good morning , mr. killaine . i 'm sorry i ca n't give you the name of my bank -- because i have no bank at the moment . that was a crude trick .
they 're all crude , when they do n't work . had breakfast ?
what a hell cat . no controlling these modern girls . they 're terrible !
terrible ! nothing terrible about her . she 's great ! marvelous youngster ! got a mind of her own . knows just what she wants . she 's not going to get it though . she wo n't get very far . has no money .
i did not burn you . i did not give you up to anyone !
this is my house ... in front of my wife , my kids ? ! what business do we have ?
ray . ray , do n't let go now , man . ray ...
you go to the council fire . i 'm going back in .
it could just as easily have been me in that box .
i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo .
are you shitting me ? ? right in the store ?
she 's been giving me the eye . she 's hot . so i wait till the owner goes up front ... .
it will be . it 'll make a change for three miserable junkies who do n't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack .
if i 'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket , i 'm just saying it had better be good . there 's plenty of other things i could be doing .
perhaps the truth is you do n't really trust anyone .
do n't tell me you 're on his side . again .
well maybe there 's a way out of here .
fat chance of that . even if we had c4 and a laser torch these doors would n't budge . that son of a bitch ... that stupid son of a bitch .
if you do n't mind my saying so , sir , i do n't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place .
well , i do n't know what to do now . we 'll just have to head inland and see if we ca n't find a settlement .
well , she comes to see me . she was upset about a lot of things , especially that whole fuckin ' diamond - that lester diamond incident .
all of a sudden , you 're the shoulder to cry on ? did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation ?
man , i was up on him years ago on the irt .
you 're selling and ending the culture . not one bit of information . only to get the money and growl with the power , man .
i do n't know the process , dr. weir was the expert ...
i do n't want to go where the last crew went . i 'd rather be dead .
you 're famous . somebody called me . what are you doing in a place like this ?
why should n't i be in a place like this ? i 'm a whore !
this time , sir , if i may be so bold , would it be possible to set up my equipment outside ciiac , perhaps in military housing at quantico ? i did n't get along very well with the other members of the division . we thought differently .
you did n't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that ? what were you doing ?
all right , let 's forget about them for the time being . what about your weed man ?
rory breaker is standing by . you stand to make a lot of money , tommy boy .
judy , i just want you to look nice . and i know what kind of suit would look well on you .
ah , no ! ! ! i do n't want to be dressed like someone dead !
no tricks , kirk . you have one minute .
no tricks . i 'm looking forward to meeting you . kirk out .
no , we wo n't . no matter how it begins , it will end in death . because it always does . is n't that always how it ends , harold -- in death ?
there has to be a threat of some sort , nobility of some sort , glamour of some sort , sport of some sort . these elements are lacking .
th-th-they 'll kill one hostage every hour until it is --
does that include helen filmore , united states congresswoman ?
let me finish , dear . you had your say , now let me have mine ...
i have n't said anything yet , j.j. , but if -
i am king , d'artagnan . i will change my mind as i wish , and i will enjoy my banquet as i wish !
but i deployed the royal guards according to your previous --
they know you ... you worked for them . you can get me in .
no , i ca n't . i 'm sorry and all , but ...
is that what the guy in the sunday school suit is doing outside ?
his name 's kevin mccall . every metro captain agrees that he 's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed .
the bible . monarchy . many wrong ideas about the government of men . my father 's people already know each man is his own nation . and only he can have dominion over himself . not kings . no man is better than any other man .
in london those radical ideas could land you in newgate prison . why were those people living in this defenseless place ... ?
if we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days , til the election , we ...
yeah , hut you ca n't hold the dam . how the hell , n'nu'n ' , i do n't get what you want < u > me < /u > to ...
going out on a limb , are n't you , nathan ?
the truth is most people do n't have table manners today . and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear , civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels .
jeanne ... the man has n't been paid for six months -- that 's his only reward . let him take a few teeth ...
a few teeth ... that 's the price of his life ?
yes , i could . i have an office in the hospital .
-- this is my lucky day . i arrive in this big bad city and i not only find a doctor , a beautiful woman as well .
five hundred wars ... arms ... drugs ... money ... everything you create is used to destroy ...
i told you not to read all that crap !
german . not in our neighborhood , man . a hundred percent irish . no one talks to cops . period .
spanish . then i guess he 's just real ... real good .
check your code again . no one at base would pull a stunt like that , terry .
that 's what i 'm doing , and it comes out the same .
look -- we appreciate it . we really do . we just -- we want to go home now .
but you do n't know how long i 've been looking for someone like you .
well , yes , compared to your other choices of expression this year , today 's events are quite mild . by the way , bobby rictor 's gonad retrieval operation went quite well , in case you 're interested .
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls . i was merely a spectator .
why do you think he took his gloves off ?
mrs. leeds was a good-looking woman . i 'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation , would n't you ?
pardon me , mr. smith is engaged . we are having a reception here this evening
oh , a party ! great , great ! jolly times and merry pranks . that 's me . i 'm a guy who loves parties . you know
if you go . it 's a second chance , kiddo . and it 'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it . you got ta get back on the horse ...
spare me , burke . i 've had my psych evaluation this month .
you hear me ? captain 's dead . owens too .
oh , no . not owens , not ... . wai ' , wai ' , wait . < u > i 'm owens < /u > . right ?
borrow ? ! this was my dress . maybe it 's a mistake . what if i 'm the only one ? i do n't even want to go . everybody 's just going to say ... hi.. where 's crazy charlie ?
mom , lots of people are separated and divorced .
but charles ' appointment was last week , not --
i know , but this is all we 've got left .
there are all sorts of men . you get to see some funny ones as a reporter .
i can understand what you mean - demented men , pathological cases . but what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard ?
well , elaine , this might be it if those guys on the ground do n't think of something .
i just want you to know , i love you ted and always will .
what 's your name ? we both know it 's not nicholai .
holy shit ! robert rath wants to know my name .
what . a. martyr . understand ; martha could n't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen . just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue .
just shut up and turn on the radio . hot probs is on .

nobody said anything about hitting her ! you 're just going to take a few liberties with her .
that 's exactly what i said ! i mean , a guy and his mother -- that 's illegal , is n't it ?
how would you propose we handle it , doctor ?
i guess i 'd say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of , thanks for the advice , but no thanks . but to dilute or censor the truth , for whatever reason --
take it easy , ruby ... it 's all right . now , try to think clearly ... do n't you mean _jason's_ hand ... do n't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed doctor layton 's throat ?
did you find a scalpel ? did you find a murder weapon ?
come on , man . i almost had this thing open .
you ever think about it ? you ever worry ?
if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed , it would have been me .
mrs. blaine ? i can tell you right now , without a doubt , that your granddaughter is alive , and did not kill del sizemore .
kay , listen , i dunno what got into --
do n't worry about it . it 's been a long night . speaking of which -- you owe me a cup of coffee , remember ?
he 's working round the clock . but the data needs to be tested , analyzed before --

oh , bullshit , he 's a fucking convict . you know how much he hated west --
i hated west , childs hated west , everyone with a goddamn brain hated west but that does n't mean we killed him !
for what ? the honor of goin ' back to some asshole of a cell ?
truth is , riddick , i 'm tired of this head-up shit . i wan na be free of you as much as you wan na be free of me .
why did you call me ? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you .
gosh . gee , lynne ... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves .
baby , please do n't ... i love you .
i do n't want to be a fool ! ... i want to look them in the eye and say , i know !
my fellow americans . i have led this fight in the war against profanity . i have founded mothers against canada . our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time .
as commander in chief , i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us-canada border in anticipation of an attack .
yes -- yes , i am the richest man -- too rich . i ca n't think of anything but money . that 's the trouble with me .
but , mr. stone , i am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience . is this your signature ?
there 's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they 're paying for water they 're not getting .
that 's all taken care of . you see , mr. gittes . either you bring the water to l.a. or you bring l.a. to the water .
you did n't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother 's stupid , tasteless , cruel animal jokes .
i was simply attempting to keep the evening light . you know that i feel similarly to you about nature .
they 're not guns . they 're particle throwers .
yeah , yeah . i just want to see 'em .
they gon na drive me anyways . soon or later they 'll get me , for one thing if not another . until then ...
you do n't aim to kill nobody , tom !
i ruined ? with all due respect , i told you to abort --
abort ? reed , i put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line , and i will not let you make me look like a fool --

they 're very , very important people and they 're interested in you . bell rings . julian rises ,
julian . this will be these people now . alex gets up .

you do n't know where this is gon na ...
why should i call the police , huh ? they do n't so any good .
well , you got ta call your wife then , you know , 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway , right ?
you 've got to learn why things work on a starship . it 's coming through now , khan ...
the prefix code is all commands from each starship bridge are relayed electronically ; each ship has its own prefix combination code ...
no , i can reassure you on that point . valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you .
he 'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut . did n't think he 'd be so bold as to take all of it .
explain what ? how you were waiting until the time was right , and then you were going to dump me for her ?
veronica ... i ... it 's not like that anymore ... i mean , it was never really like that ...
am i not safe enough with you , john ?
aye . but there are fenians reported on the mainland .
give ... give him ... give him glaaaa -- !
twenty-five percent , and not one single farthing more .
alright , i was wrong . there is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster .
i took the padlock off your door . what more do you want ?
beth shalom ? what are you talking about ? who is this ... ?
lina , you said if i was going to plant a bomb , i should --
sure , auggie . i follow . when you do n't know nothing , it 's like paradise . i know what that is . it 's after you 're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels .
jesus , man , you 're one fucking mess .
they also tried using viral r.n.a . as the bonding element .
that 's right . c.d.c . found out and closed them down ...
she went out . she said she went out to run some errands . she 'll be back .
she 's a good girl . she 's a little nuts , but she 's a good girl i think . she 's a little daffy .
do you always think about sex ? i 'm talking about some very important stuff here !
listen buttercup , let 's make love and forget about the whole thing .
how camest thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ? the garden walls are high and hard to climb , and the place death , considering who thou art , if any of my kinsmen find thee here .
with love 's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls ; for stony limits can not hold love out , and what love can do that dares love attempt ; therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me .
listen , hillbilly , you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven .
ai n't no thing but a chicken wing , buttercup .
i heard that one myself , bob . hell , i even thought i was dead til i found out it was just i was in nebraska . who 's your friend ?
ww beauchamp ... little bill daggett and ... `` friends . ''
what does he think of your chosen line of work ?
i do n't know . he was shot and killed when i was fourteen on the steps of his church in bethesda .
my uncle can probably get you on my demo team .
what the fuck ? i just asked you for a job yesterday !
it 's not `` invisibility '' per se . you 're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field . that 's what you projected on the bridge .
what about you ? you have n't eaten in days . how come you 're never on this side of the microscope ?
in your present condition , alice , we 're worried about your ability --
what are you talking about ? my `` condition '' ? ...
you 've never had any formal training , either ?
not a class , not a thing , just picked stuff up by myself .
many worthy of attention ; but valuing is something more . i could value only someone whom i loved .
then you have never loved ? your heart is empty .
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
well , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do ; they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
well , what 's the difference ? i just need it .
well , i mean ... you know , i got ta ask you . that 's a lot of money . you 're not asking for a box of popcorn , you know . i mean ...
i 'm dying for a shower . you could use one too . and we 'd better check that bandage .
later . i 'm going out for materiel . keep this .
you are always trying to keep it real . i 'm in love with how you feel . i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train . i kiss you all starryeyed , my body 's swinging from side to side . i do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
you 're either having a seizure or you just said `` hello . ''
good , i was n't sure you were up to it .
i 'm gon na throw up , frank . i mean it . let 's drop it for the ten o'clock , okay ?
susie . it 's one more show . one more time . that 's all .
i 'm not trying to lose them . nor am i exceeding any speed limits .
the one thing you do n't want is to attract the police .
teddy roosevelt , one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now . these people are friends of mine , so i must return and find out what happened .
this island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place .
you ca n't do this , jennifer . i warned you .
so what 's the big deal . oh . okay . they 're like not good at basketball anymore . like -- omigod , what a tragedy .
all right , all right , so we can say he is good .
better than good , he is a fucking liability .
commander ... welcome to the protector ii . would you like to don your uniform ?
mind if we skip that ? i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys .
no , it 's got a little left . they 'll be in to change it .
robert , you leave it up these people ... !
i 'm serious , dude . you always seem to be on top of things , even when you 're tweakin ' .
i guess there 's just no substitute for good genes .
abstract mathematics , relativity of dimensions , geometrical `` durations '' -- even allowing for the uses of speculation , what is the point ?
because it 's a new way of seeing the world ! of seeing our place in it !
maybe . i 'm feeling a little sad myself tonight .
you mean , with your wife leaving you and all ? hannah mentioned something about it . about a note .
if i pay homage to another 's throne , then how am i a king ?
homage is nothing . it is the crown that matters !
get up out of the chair , and walk toward the backdoor , richard .
i get thrown in solitary until i do n't know my own fuckin ' name , and then you people tell me i can beat nine years if i help you . i helped you !
you are pretty naive if you think it is .
i 'm pretty naive ? look at you . you have to do all this , and what have you got to show for it ? nothing .
look , bud , what 's the idea ? i live in a shack in potter 's field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . and i ai n't never seen you before in my life .
okay . just step on it . just get me home .
i 'm a little tired and it 's just a pick-me-up .
but you only wore mascara when you and daddy went on romantic dates ...
four hundred and fifty and i 'll cut your throat if you try any tricks !
all right , all right . you ca n't blame a guy for tryin ' , can you ?
a bit rapidly . i do n't care what you say about david , he 's a perfectly fine teacher !
david ! david ! i ca n't believe this !
the nite owl ! stensland was going there to sell the heroin .
somebody got wind of it , killed them all .
oh , `` starry night '' time , huh ?
you ever heard the saying , `` any port in a storm ? ''
do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden ?
no ... actually , i even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d ...
they 're for my cat . i use them to train him not to rip up paper .
you know , i 've never seen your cat .
where is it ? where are the drugs ? where are they ?
fuck you . i was n't doing anything . you 're like the gestapo .

was in all the papers three years ago . i 'm seventy-six , was only seventy- three then . had a business in buffalo , new york , called rats with wings . killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed .
& quot ; those who travel far and near this will make you disappear ! & quot ;
i have to work on my video project ! do n't follow me ! i can put myself to bed .
she needs a family . a dad . i 'll give her what you never had .
do n't get my hopes up . if i quit , what then ? i ca n't go through this again .
that 's right , you just stood there and watched , because you `` felt like it . '' almost makes you worse .
what do you want ? you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby ... ?
uh ... not a great first impression ... dinner 's ready .
then what are we doing sitting around yapping ? let 's eat !
not me , sonny . i 'm just going to sit around and listen . what 's this ?
calendar for the day . you 'll find the senate manual in the drawer . anything else you want , just snap for a page .
i 'll be going . ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another , as king enters .
well , if it is n't the groom himself ! you 're just in time , king .
there 's something out there , you know , something under that sand .
yes , i 'm hoping to find a certain artifact , a book , actually , my brother thinks there 's treasure . what do you think is out there ?
that 's exactly right , will . so the question as i see it is n't `` why should you work for n.s.a . '' it 's `` why should n't you ? ''
why should n't i work for the national security agency ? that 's a tough one .
now tom , you simply can not go to philadelphia tonight . that 's all there is to it .
but i have to go , dear . it 's a very important banker 's meeting .
you 're cute . you have any money , claude ?
ten dollars . but i need it to get home .
just a minute . you made a couple of cracks before and i let them slide . but i do n't intend to take any more . if you resent my having money , start a revolution , but get off my back .
look , lieutenant . all your dough wo n't help you here . because here you 're on your own . and no mother to throw you a lifebelt . now let 's see how good you can swim .
do n't talk to me about importance . because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy .
what ? ! ! what are you talking about ? !
aw come on , it was the only thing to do . he knew he was holdin ' ya back .
we were partners . if it were n't for luther i 'd still be hustlin ' pinball down at gianelli 's . i do n't need anything more than i got .
harry , that 's not nice . i 'm in church now .
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you were n't saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road .
ordell called and wants to meet me and i 'm scared .
we get ordell to come to my office . nicolet -- is he already there , or does he come busting in while we 're chatting ?
yea ... it 's great ... seems like ... i do n't know you 've got all the important stuff in there .
all right then . it 's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment . will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything ?
pish posh , mr. boone . i 'm not your aunt tilly .
but it 's just my face you want to draw .
i also need someone who can read and write .

'cause , uh , you never know what 's gon na happen .

but you look like you been in a train wreck , how 'd he just drive away ?
seems like doyle 's wormed his way back in . mama said he 's stayin ' over tonight and he 's talkin ' about movin ' in for good . we ai n't ever gon na be happy . we 'll always be nervous , wo n't we karl ?
i do n't reckon i know . i ai n't found no way yet and i 'm three or four times as old as you . might be that 's just the way folks is .
that 's how we came to be in your service , if you take my meaning ...
tell me where you 've been . i am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars . my father was a jedi ! were you in many battles ?
no , no . this is a man -- this man has a name ...
but , in project mayhem , we have no names .
what 's wrong , doctor ? you seem ... lonely .
oh , a little . but it 's not just physical loneliness . it 's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually ... as i have you .
i do n't think it 's counterfeit . do you mind if i take a look at all your real bills to compare ?
it 's the scientific method . it 's all the rage .
i 'm not going to college , jos . and i 'm not playing anymore baseball . this is my life .

i wo n't allow starfleet to be dismantled over some klingon promises .
starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a court martial on this ship , lieutenant . win , lose or draw it will be on your record .
-- and i guess , sure , seeing you would be part of that whole equation ... i suppose the most important thing , really . i do n't know . anyway , this whole thing 's my therapist 's idea . it 's my shrink , really .
ohhh . you 're in therapy too , marty ?
places where the road bends , places away from buildings , places where the traffic thins out . but you do n't have to understand . i do . so no talking .
are you going to quit ? my last bodyguard quit .
they never kill themselves . how do you know it was him . you never met him . you never even saw a photograph ...
helen -- let go . you 've got to let go .
it 's nothin ' compared to what you could be makin ' on the big con . you 're wastin ' your time workin ' street marks .

there 's kind of this guy i 'm seeing .
you 're cheating on george ? jennifer , how could you ?
they do n't blame you . when a bank employee does this they understand . you get your life back . anyway i bet you hated that bank .

i do n't drink coffee . on the other hand , since you insist , if you offered me a cold lemonade . i would n't say no .
good . lemonade it is . i 'm paul .
the key word here is talk , dante . i think the idea , the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date .
so ... what ? so we should just make pretend over the phone that we 're dating ?
i 'm not doing any tutoring this year . i 'm too busy .
it 's not that . can we meet after school ? please ?
i 'm sorry . she misunderstood , that 's all .

he 's best friends with jim gordon and harvey dent . they would know .
... okay , then , i have a confession to make . i 'm the batman .
was it the same oswald , dave , that was in dallas , or was it an impersonator .

mr. howard is so heinous . he 's always giving me a hard time . i get a c-plus on the test and he tells me , 'you have no sense of history . ' i have no sense of history ? he wears a brown tie .
you got a c-plus ? i ca n't believe i cheated off you .
you 're going to get yourself up and go out ?
buddy , mr. right is out there somewhere and i 'm gon na find him !
after that my parents never let me go to dignan 's again .
they blamed my family for everything . they always said mr. langston saved anthony 's life .
your boys out there cooped up together , need somewhere they can let the steam out . if they 're black , there 's not but one place in this town they feel welcome . been that way since before you were born .
we have an enlisted man 's club at the post .

what you do n't want to imagine is the things i 've done .
i was sent from the post in place of our social editor .
yes , of course . miss ramsey telephoned me . well , what would you like to have ?
you take all my money , but you 're borrowing part of it ?
at eighteen percent , okay ? and do n't ask me no more fuckin ' questions . i 'm leaving .
you just would n't . it 's not the amish way . but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night .
listen , i do n't know what 's going on or how you got mixed up with him , but do n't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around , okay ?
look . i want you to take her . i mean it . take her . you need all the help you can get . she 's the fastest ship in the fleet .

you handed out the money . maybe there 's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done --
well , if i do find out something , can i look you up again ?
why do n't you leave this town - go home ?
the problem with that is that then there 's one extra --
then put him with the feldmans . whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me .
during the middle ages people were executed at every corner . what 's your point ?
this house , the whole damned area around here is one mass grave ... now you might call me crazy , but there is something negative about the place .
who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people ?

people had a choice , even if they took it for granted . and now they do n't .

i did n't wait on him . fifty or so , white , regular build , needed a shave -- that 's all i remember .
how did you know he was a construction worker ?
he could at least show some respect and show his face , even if he does n't have the money ...
'amen i say to thee , thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny . '
oh , right . dwayne . you 're engaged to dwayne ?
it just happened . i did n't plan it . i was alone . and he was ... there . but now everything 's changed . i owe it to him to let him know . i need to tell him .

you will have to make all the jokes , because i 'm going to be very serious .
tough break . most men have to get married before they lose their wives .

no , no , you 're ... lookin ' good . you 've got good color in your cheeks .
no -- i can see it in your eyes . i 'm a goner . it 's alright , z. in this ant 's army , a soldier 's life ai n't worth a sack of fungus . i ca n't feel my legs ...
it 's direct , anyway , which seems to be difficult for you .
i 'd like you to leave now . is that direct enough ?
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
yeah . i know . the custody suit thing was just my getting back at her . i 'm not as dumb as i look . whatever you say . i love my daughter . i 'll send you the five hundred .
take two , three days . call when you get there .
maybe i 'll swing around los ang gleez on the way .
no . i did n't . i swear i did n't . i probably helped push you to kill yourself , but i did n't do it .
i did n't kill myself . i died from a blow to the head . how 'd it happen ? i have to know .
it does not come off as easily as the young ones .
perhaps -- but it comes off none the less .
are you kidding ? there were sparks between us ! this scarf is a sign !
it 's a sign that you 're crazy ! do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is ?
thank you , but i really have to go .
but it 's oat straw tea . you 've never had oat straw tea , have you ?
your grace , i 've got something to tell you . i want to complain about this man .
go ahead , tell him . tell them all . they wo n't understand you anyway .
i doubt it . and these two other people , did they hear anything ?
no , they were asleep . they did n't even wake up .
thank you . rick , there are many exit visas sold in this cafe , but we know that you have never sold one . that is the reason we permit you to remain open .
i thought it was because we let you win at roulette .
uh , if you could , just , uh , support , uh , a small airfield ...
it 's been sometime since , uh , i received any , uh , of that kind of , uh ... attention . a couple of ... years .
i just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it does n't have to be vietnam . you do n't get treated badly here do you ?
i do n't get treated at all , but hey , do n't worry about it . i 'll do your thing . it 'll give my mom a smile .
it was left in my hotel room , well , not really mine . you 're saying it 's not you ?
i think i would remember . what makes you think it 's me ?
hey you 're the guy from down the hall .
come on , quit fucking around . listen it 's about ... what we did together last night .
waiter , the check . this man is trying to hold a gun to my head !
that 's the horse ! shotgun - shotgun in the fifth !
roger , do you understand what the word 'no ' means ? it 's important we establish a rapport . something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who has n't had a donut in a year .
so you 're giving a man who butchers whole families , little babies included , my chocolate cream filled ?
do n't i ? ... say , that 's mighty white of you , jabez .
not at all , hank ... not at all . glad to help you .
let me speak to mr. smith . i want to hear it from him .
fuck you . i 'm running this shit . you talk to me .
i remember a pair of young philosophers once , who laughed at the world .
well , i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements ... but which i now see means us all .
you ai n't going down there . not alone . i 'll go .
fine . but i 'm bringing a couple of friends .
you do n't have to make a pose of it .
it 's the only pose i have left . i 'm sunk . broke . i do n't even have my hotel bill .
but the bureau knew sparazza killed heller . why not go after him , guns blazing ' for that one ?
heller was buried in agency lore , anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed , hoover blackballed their memory . look at ness .
i have to do this . so i can become a nun .
initiation . you understand . later on , we make her wear her underwear on her head .
but ringo starr does n't look anything like topol .
no , well ... he was quite a long way away .
let 's hope he has n't changed the combination . he 's quite intelligent ...
wait for my signal , spock -- too soon and he 'll have time to figure it out and raise them again .
the manifold ca n't handle full impulse in the patch , commander .
if we do n't outrun them , the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship .
you mean kayo nolan , the old timer ? he does n't know much .
he do n't , huh ? well , he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation .
who wants to eat ? i just wan na get over there !
no you do n't ! you do n't want any broads with boots on !
does n't matter . i ... i do n't want to come back , that 's all .
oh . well , what are you going to do ? you have to go to school , honey . i mean , what --
-- do you < u > agree < /u > it 's that < u > old < /u > , nick ?
okay , fine , whatever , yes -- it 's an < u > old < /u > tree .
are you sure we should be driving like this ? in broad daylight and everything ?
no we should n't , but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime !
so you 're into `` reason , '' too ? finally , someone civilized ! i 'm ellen , what can i get you ?
hi , i 'm betty . i 'll take a miller , if you got it ...
you got it , a great spender of other people 's money .
well , if you 're that good , you could probably do wonders at my place .
so if you 're not running and ike graham is there to see it , then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending , right ? all we 're doing is turning lemon into lemonade .
i 've got news for you . no amount of sugar and water is going to turn like graham into something you want to take on a picnic .
you 're telling me you want out ? already ? you 're telling me you do n't want the money ? hugo is going off . he smells . the flat smells . we ca n't wait any longer .
i 'm just telling you i ca n't cut him up .
aww , man . you just need to chill out . come on , there 's this party tonight it 's gon na be fun . lot 's of alcohol and honeys .
alright , but i ai n't drinking . and you 're gon na have to look after me .
colwyn , do n't be a fool . you ca n't do battle with that thing .
there 's no way to outrun it . you know that . this is what ynyr was preparing me for . it 's what he died for .
hey , where 's claude ? i do n't see claude !
stay calm , ray . we 'll find him . claude ! has anyone seen claude ?
you reached down into death . now , is n't that right ?
my god , we tried to save her ... you ca n't know ... you ca n't know ...
i brought a present for the lady , there . i 'm looking for her , to give her the present ...
you break into her apartment to deliver a gift ? where is it ?
yeah even then look what happened : michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me .
well that 's not going to happen tonight . george said carlton 's a nice guy .
no -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money .
oh , no -- no -- not the baron .
i know you do . but it is different . it 's different . we 'll be all right tomorrow .
we are always going to be all right tomorrow . i 'd like to be all right a few todays .
you know what really scares me ? living too long . losing my hair and my teeth ... and my guts and my wind . and my brains ... sitting in a room with my hands in my lap , watching daytime tv .
you do n't believe any of this . you do n't think you 'll ever die .
i 'm sure you mean that to be comforting , but-
-you 'll have to deal with it , nigel .
no . pursuit < u > ends < /u > when we know exactly where he is .
yes , well , i think we need some fresh eyes on this problem . i 'm bringing in some people from upstairs .
i had to get in , to meet margo ! i had to say something , be somebody , make her like me !
she did like you , she helped and trusted you ! you paid her back by trying to take bill away !
it 's there . the boss called , you said so yourself .
and that dump you live in ! those clown pictures on the walls !
oh , look , mr. hogan , i 'm really sorry about what happened in there . really --
you can be great , kid , just stick with it . but let me give you one little piece of advice ... be a good guy .
we ca n't change what 's past . not even the war can do that .
we did all the proper things , and we lost love . that 's sad , mac .
i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin , in which case you 'll have to close the store tonight .
all right , but you 're missing out . chicks with dicks .
please - i ca n't explain things like this to your right ear .
last night in this very restaurant mr. jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear .
what are ya gon na do , call the cops ?
i do n't have to . you 'll be bustin ' in on the chief of police just up the hall .
it 's not like i figured . it 's cold . and it 's heavier than i imagined .
i would n't know . i never imagined this . not in my whole life did i ever imagine this .
this is how you wan na spend the time , then go , go , go -- you 're gon na be surprised at what a waste it is -- `` the most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me , '' chapter three --
we talked earlier about your mother . and we talked about your father and his death . and i do n't want to be challenging or defeatist here , but i have to ask and i would want to clarify something -- something that i understand --
well if we 're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen .
no , no ... there 's plenty for everybody ... oh , max , this is sam ... and the frog brothers ...
beautiful . and what of it ? let me tell you something : so far as i 'm concerned , her whole sex appeal is in that safe !
gaston . let 's open it -- right now ! let 's get away from here ! i do n't like this place !
you 're gon na hafta learn to deal with it .
deal ! i 'm dealing with two guys named cheech !
i 'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you 're going to do it .
come off it , leo . i 'm late for work ...
it 's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun , has palm trees out front , mountains in the background ...
really ? you 've just described all of southern california .
there is < u > one < /u > thing i 'd like you to tell me .
i 'm trying to find things out myself -- that 's the whole point .
i ai n't cheated you , pilgrim . this is research , damn it ! that girl could have told us something .
research , my ass . i suppose these are the 'extra expenses ' i 've been paying for ? and in the middle of the morning , too .
try to understand , vickie . jake 's got a lotta aggravation . he 's been a top contender too long .
that 's right , take his part . you 're his brother . he 's never gon na be champ . too many people are against him .
forget it , kid . what 's it *to* you ?
nothing . i 'm just saying -- i might be able to lie , cheat , steal -- and i 'd still tear into a guy i saw kicking a dog . not that *he* is , by a long shot --
i do n't want no dirty money . i run an honest business .
honest like al capone on tax day . where are my keys ?
he 's dead , is n't he . buzz fazeli might just as well have died before you were born .
mom , you know i had to do it . i just did it a little too late .
what can i do ? i am only a boy .
you are the man who wrote this letter . you are the man who has come back to lead us . you will soon have great responsibilities . you must know what to do .
no . no thank you , doctor . you go home .
you know ... sometimes people can surprise you . sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth .
today . and now you -- there 's a dog in the van --
-- i know . i fed it , and i ca n't get rid of --
mom and dad wo n't be back until sunday night . it 's halloween carnival . we should throw a party . we could totally get away with it .
okay , but it has to be a small one .
well , i do n't know if we want to buy all $ worth ...
hey ! you want good stuff , or you want shit ?
yeah , you know . you know what it felt like .
i got ta do this , stephen . i got ta know .
listen , you got somethin ' that none of us have .
why is it always this ? i owe it to myself ? what if i do n't want to ?
nah , it probably wo n't turn up anything . i 'm just gon na talk to him .
good . i do n't want to be late .
oh no , no , no . no can do . you enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and i do n't care if it 's a styrofoam cup or the exxon valdez ! you 've got to learn to take responsibility !
what are you going to do ? make me throw it out ?
yes . he 's a good kid . maybe a little messed up .
well , i 'm sure with the proper guidance he 'll be fine .
nine bodies in roswell , now this -- it 's getting a little hairy , huh ?
i 'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself .
do n't call it desertion . our little restaurant ... that is our russia ... the russia of borscht , the russia of beef stroganoff , blinis with sour cream ...
... the russia of piroshki ... people will eat and love it .
what ? please ? now ? tell me ? !
mrs. connelly . i 'm martin bettes ... dr. bettes .

guys who 'll come after her . guys who 'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend . they 'll want to make somebody pay . maybe she 'll try and make it you .
yeah , well maybe she 'll make it you . is that it ? you worried she 'll use me against you ?
what was that about the ss , the rate , the ... ?
the jewish worker 's salary , you pay it directly to the ss , not to the worker . he gets nothing .
that what happen -- you lost you only daughter so 's you killed yourself ! that 's what we say , all right .
that 's right . i know you understand how i feel , homer -- you is breakin ' them rules , too . ai n't that right ?
no , thelma , i do n't give a shit what we have for dinner . i may not even make it home for dinner . you know how fridays are .
funny how so many people wan na buy carpet on a friday night . you 'd almost think they 's want to forget about it for the weekend .
i ... do n't think ... anybody should be touching the body .
i think i 'll do what i damn well please .
pritchett , this `` lockdown '' thing -- it 's got ta have like a master control -- you know machinery , gears , whatever -- somewhere in this place ?
the basement -- but , believe me , you do n't want to go down there .
break it down to me , what 's going on ?
seems like they 're cooperating . hopefully i 'll be out of here and on my way very soon .
war-mongering bully ! do n't think you 're going to intimidate me !
all right , mister ambassador ! but you must treat general `` buck '' schmuck with the respect due him .
i thought i would ask you a few questions if that 's okay .
huh . you used to come to the club ? i should n't have let you in . you must have only been about sixteen .
do n't get sidetracked ! how does he get back to the states ? that 's the point . does he have any problems ?
none ! the state department issues him a new passport in hours and loans him the money to travel . he 's never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or , as far as we know , debriefed by the cia .
we made a deal for everything inside the cabinet .
inside , out-fuckin'-side . i do n't give a shit , you get those guns because if you do n't . . .
... you do n't suppose she could really be sick , do you ? oh -- oh , i 've got to go home right away !
but -- what 's this ? i thought you were going along with me .
yes . ceiling . why did you run away ?
i did n't run away . i left the flat .
they gave me pills to make me sleep . they did n't realize how much seconal i 'm used to -- that i 'd have so much tolerance --
well i 'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when i 'm about to make the most important score of my life . this has got ta be some `` put-on , '' right ?
i do n't know . but i can feel it coming . it 's like ... like a lull before the storm . charley vidal says ...
charley vidal says ! do n't throw charley vidal up to me !
i 'm so glad you 're here louis ... i 've dreamed of your coming ...
do n't try to speak ... it 's alright ...
i 'm holding you to that . gabe , what about frank ?
i do n't know . i do n't know .
well , some say . it 's not for you to worry about . another will be chosen .
he was always nice to me . he found me . he saw me in his dreams .
i sense the fumes of opium in all this . perhaps miss scott picked up the habit in shanghai .
what 're you talking about -- i 'm not a dope fiend ! i saw it ! i 'll show you !
if you want to go on , i can make it all right .
like i said , i was thinkin ' of the horses .
what ? you do n't like to see a traitor get hurt ? i wonder why that is ?
if you got something to say , say it .
maybe we could have lunch one day next week ? you know , i 'm downtown near wall street quite often .
oh , i do n't know , victoria . i 'm at work all the time .
so you 're basically lying your ass off the whole time ? i could n't do it .
well , think of it as playing a role . it 's fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .
look . you and i can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up , talking about what 's right and what 's wrong . you 're from the reservation . it 's a different world .
i 'm from minneapolis . fifth street . i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res . so i know about the other world , ray .
okay , let 's get down to it . i did my part and got you out . so now you tell me where we 're goin ' ?
do n't worry , i got a move for ya . an awesome move . a guy named luther . ganz 'll be paying him a visit . we go to him right away .
so that was my part ? smile and shake my ass ?
no . you have another part ? you 'll know what to do .
we thought it might be her husband . sometimes he comes and checks up on her . she told him i was down in florida .
a minute or two , you 're gon na wish you were .
i love you . i love you so much . you 've got to know that . you 've got to know .
i know , dad . i love you too .
why are the police taking this all so seriously ?
it 's not the police . it 's the department of transport . internal politics . it 's a joke . they have no idea who we really are
i 've been thinking about what you said the other night ... if the offer 's still on the table , i 'd like to talk about it .
... okay . i 'll arrange things with your assignment captain . marty 's a good man , brian .
i 'm sorry . i 'm squishing you . i 'll move to the ...
no . stay . i want you close to me . this couch is wrong . it 's not a `` married couch . ''
you , me and harry . he 's asleep .
wake him , then . let 's go . get outta --
and i could n't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. i had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut .
that 's a shame . i 'll send the key right down . and about your promotion -- -- i 'm sending that efficiency report right up to mr. sheldrake , in personnel . i would n't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over .
no . it 's all right . i just meant , it might be a little dull for you , telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere .
this is your home . it 's not nowhere . and it 's not dull .
ma ! ... where 's mary ... and little dan'l ?
gone with daniel webster -- to marshfield , son ... . you told mary to go --
twelve dollars ! -- for those rheumatic uncles of yours ? out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it ?
if you 're talking about my brother- in-law , he 's worked for the city fifteen years .
was he a relative ? or an intimate friend ?
he was a very wealthy man , he looked after me since i was young .
then , you 'll take her to see tatiana ?
oh , heavens i must say ... no , no actually , i ca n't - tatiana has refused to see any more girls .
lonnie elam said never to go up there . lonnie elam said that 's a haunted house . he said real awful stuff happened there once .
lonnie elam probably wo n't get out of the sixth grade .
bond . if someone wants you dead , it is renard . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .
but you would have something to gain by killing robert king . and stopping his pipeline .
oh , i see . i beg your pardon .
when i 'm surrounded , with my back against the wall , you 're not going to lay down on me , are you --
well , first things first , staying here 's goofy . we got ta book up .
so what do you suggest , we go to a hotel ? we got a guy who 's shot in the belly , he ca n't walk , he bleeds like a stuck pig , and when he 's awake , he screams in pain .
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin ' , but nobody 's gon na pay good money for a cut-up whore .
you boys are off of the spade outfit . got your own string of ponies ?
you tell your pa a company of rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an ' equipped will be in the field by daylight ... headin ' for the south end of the malapai . if he can catch up with us , well an ' good ...
but ... but captain , we ca n't possibly take the field tomorrow ... for your own protection ...
far as it goes . of course he has to swim in the same water we all do .
of course , but you 've got no reason to think he 's bungled the case ?
i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends .
yes , well unfortunately i ca n't just switch the `` on '' button to `` off . '' the sad fact of the matter is that you 've unintentionally rubbed off on me .
all right ... we 've lost control of eight decks ... three cargo bays ... one shuttlebay .
do we have any idea how many borg we 're dealing with ?

why else would he be taking you to the ivy ? you 've been dating for a year -- it 's not like he 's trying to impress you .
i know , but that 's not the way things happened ...
you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge ?
she did ? i love her so much , and i have n't seen her in such a long time . and grandpa barney . is he all , right ?
yes , he 's fine , too . you saw them at easter .
does that bother you , bill ? i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute , she has to have bad eyesight .
he 'll never sign a statement , boss , let alone get on a witness stand .
alvy , you 're incapable of enjoying life , you know that ? i mean , your life is new york city . you 're just this person . you 're like this island unto yourself .
i ca n't enjoy anything unless i ... unless everybody is . i-you know , if one guy is starving someplace , that 's ... you know , i-i ... it puts a crimp in my evening . so wan na get married or what ?
if leo comes here , he wo n't believe that i am out doing the `` meals on wheels '' .
do n't worry , shelly , i 'll handle leo .
i work with ramada . we 're doing some pictures together .
well , next time you talk to him , tell him to pay his actresses more .
i believe you are acquainted with my brother , joseph bonaparte , and my aide , major junot .
yes , sir , i had the honor of meeting them on the trip from paris .
he helps administer the charities now , and i give him a reasonable allowance . he has no money of his own . i know how he likes to present himself ; father 's weakness is vanity . hence the slut .
huh . jeez . well , so , did he -- is that yoga ?
like you do n't give her a hard time .
just cause i do n't kiss her booty like you ...
hurry , help me out of here ! what 're you waiting for ? !
uh , listen -- willie -- i got a better idea .
do n't run . they 'd like any excuse to shoot us .
you drive ! i think there 's something wrong with me .
hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam . dinosaurs had their shot . nature selected them for extinction .
i do n't understand this luddite attitude , especially from a scientist . how could we stand in the light of discovery and not act ?
yes , all right , i 'll wait for you . good-by .
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world .
for chrissake , i 'll do it . what 's the combination ? !
to the left twice then five no ... sorry ... i think it 's fifteen ... it 's been a while ...
loomis . folks around here are n't likely to forget your face . at least not cops . so what brings you back here after years ?
michael myers has escaped from ridgemont . he 's here in haddonfield .
i 'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head .
of course you 're not . we 'll take good care of you .
n-n-n-n-no , no , i du-du-du-did n't , i did n't !
i do n't want your mother to believe something like this but what am i to think ?
if someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe . i 'm assembling a team of specialists , mr. case . we need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur .
my days of punching deck are over . for you or anybody else .
you keep that up and you 'll crab the whole war .
carry out this tragic folly if you will -- but i for one will not be a part of it . i will stay here in freedonia .
-- all right . i tried to reason with you . i tried everything . now i want those letters . get them for me .
i do n't have to . i 've got them right here .
wearing a uniform does n't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage , < u > commander < /u > ! it just so happens i 'm < u > not < /u > a coward - physical or mental - and before i 'd risk my father 's life ...
we 're < u > all < /u > risking our lives !
you did n't want to see me , did you ?
if there is one thing i ca n't stand about sleeping with women , it 's all the fucking mind reading .
i said keep your nose out of my life . no kid is going to tell me how to run it .
you think you 're so slmighty -- smart -- who are you to sit up there and say nobody 's good enough for you , like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
the pain is getting worse . i need more aspirin .
i ca n't give you anymore . i 'll talk to the doctor .
i did what you said , man ! we 're pooling our student funds with hillel house and we 're going to have an awareness dance .
oh goody , nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of hava nagila til i puke .
good . i 'm good . did you finish that paper for worth 's class yet ?
no , not yet . i tried to work on it a little last night , but i 'm having trouble concentrating .
i do n't know him . is he a nice guy ? you think he 'll help me out ?
i do n't see why not . when you gon na come round and see my new place ?
why , sure . it 's a lotta hooey .
that 's what i wanted to say , but i could n't think of it .
you 've got an inferiority complex , you have .
yeah , i know , that 's why i took up the drums . it 's me active compensatory factor .
jesus . you 're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m ...
i know that ! i was distracted by grief !
oh , yes . will you help me fold these , please ?
they were ready to blame him for anything , no matter where it happened .
you wanted to know what happened after the line-up , i 'm telling you .
oh come on , verbal . who do you think you 're talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ? bullshit . he was using her .
havana ? cubans do n't like us or my business ...
are you afraid ? good . and you do n't need a visa . cause you 're with me .
are you here illegally ? do n't worry about that . we 'll talk to immigration . they wo n't deport you .
no , no , do n't talk to immigration !
okay . the police are gon na need your full name and address .
no ! no police . they 'll know right away the authorities are looking for us . they 'll kill us . we 've seen their faces .
you 're in the central corridor . it connects the personnel areas to engineering .
peters and i will search the forward decks . justin , take engineering . no hot-dogging , not on this one , alright ?
i come to you as a last resort -- and i confess that my patience is wearing thin . must i take drastic action in order to get a hearing ?
what -- what sort of action do you mean ?
i 'm in from new york . i came to see swann .
what a tragedy . it was just a matter of time , of course , but it 's not good for the business .
let 's talk to whoever can get this over with ...
hold on ... they want your driver 's license number .
who 's the best power forward in the nba ... jameson ?
jameson ? who are you trying to con ... ?
i know , but this is all we 've got left .
well , you 're right there . ten minutes ago i had a job .
i 'm not a bloody teenager okay , i told you i ca n't do that shit .
that 's it , i am just stupid teenager , yes ?
a pretty young woman , to turn him on ? i do n't believe lecter 's ever seen a woman in eight years . and oh , are you ever his `` taste '' - so to speak .
i graduated magna from uva , doctor . it 's not a charm school .
i told you , elle . i need someone -- serious .
i 'm seriously in love with you -- is n't that enough ?
sounds great to me , i 'm going to call her , that 's what 's cool about her .
brains stay with brains . the bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques .
i had n't been there ice skating in many years , and i had a couple of young friends with me , and we decided we wanted to go ice skating .
dave , may i ask why the urge to go ice skating in texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory ?
no . no way . i ca n't do this .
max . you threw my briefcase in the river . you 've got balls bigger than toledo .
i 'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
sounds good . but right now i should go .
did it ever occur to you that i might not want to kill you ?
i 've got fifty thousand dollars says you will .
why do i feel like i 'm on a blind date ?
they say love is blind . do you think that 's true ?
you loved her , did n't you . well , so did i. you 'll have to admit she had four husbands .
yeah , it took her a while to grow up and find mr. right , but she did it . she found him .
yeah . what are you going to do ? that toby 's a hot head .
he is at that . no so much a fault of his own . poor boy had quite a trauma as a child .
i 'm a jew in show business . why come to me ?
i 'm gon na < u > tell < /u > you why ...
[ fantasy time , girls , give it up , give it up . ]
lionheart here . i 'm back . sorry about the absence . i had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel .
you think that story 's gon na make me loan you money ?
it 's the truth . if you 'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened .
i 'll be with you always , my friends . who knows , maybe if i 'm lucky , i 'll rejoin you with wings and a beak .
wings and a halo , my darling . wings and a halo .
no . she was mindless but not like miss jessica . but the houngan cured her .
are you trying to tell me that the houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure mrs. holland ?
but ... but you said you only had sex with three guys ! you never mentioned him !
that 's because i never had sex with him !
gosh , i loved that show . watched it for years .
that 's not the reason . i 've got a date at six thirty .
i know just how you feel , son . but believe me , you 're going about it the wrong way .
do n't look like there 's a right way .
hell , boy there some other duke you know about ? a great american .
yeah , i was never that big of a western fan . i like science fiction .
the nsa thinks the un is onto your work ...
... here , and the white house is screaming about chemical weapons , and we 're ...
i prefer not to push the engines until they 've been properly run in .
of course i leave it to your good offices to decide what 's best , but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into new york tuesday night and surprise them all . retire with a bang , eh , e.j . ?
i do n't know about you , but i feed off my emotions .
he 'll string us along all the way if we 're not careful .
then makes sure she continues to see him . gets him confide in her and report to you .
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief .
um , i understand that this science friction is popular -- but do n't the big hits always have big stars ?
yeah , well we 've got a big star ! bela lugosi ! !
i do n't know . but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility .
and yet you 're willing to die for this cause , the one thing that 's given your life a sense of purpose . do n't you see the contradiction here -- ?
kill them all . get rid of them . messy animals .
... probably contain more than a hundred billion birds !
and bring my knees up , < u > real < /u > hard , yeh ?
no , that never solves anything . you talk like the big girl you are . about what you feel . and how he 's hurt you . you know ? you tell the truth .
yeah , well he did , did n't he .
please , ted . i never would have brought it up if i thought --
we leave the money and the watch on the table . and we cover it like this . in full view . the germans will search high and low , i promise you , they 'll never notice it .
of course they 'll notice it . but look -- this is a good place for something .
i crossed paths with him . that 's why i 'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood . to make sure i do n't run into him again .
so that 's the something you were n't supposed to see , huh ?
i 'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you 've disrupted me at work .
you and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident were n't you ?
i did n't mean for you to see it . it 's like looking in someone 's diary and taking it out of context . know what i mean ?
it made me feel like you could see inside of me . and i do n't know how that 's possible .
since caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear , so please .
i 'll ask the lieutenant . but thank you .
what 'll it be like in california , sailor , do you think ? i hear it do n't rain much there .
you got about six more big states to go before we find out .
trying not to be . trying to jump ship .
so now , did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile ? it 's just -- upstairs -- were n't you under the r stand ? i thought i saw you there .
no , no . not at my hotel . i , uh , i have things to do in the city before i leave . i 'll meet you at the station , huh ?
all right . at a quarter to five . say , why do n't we get married in marseilles ?
she 's fine . you really think i 'd be a good investment ?
i would n't say so if i did n't .
elm that 's it , it explains the periodicity , the - -
- - the undigested state of the berries because it 's - -
all right -- do n't spoil the trip with any of those jokes -- there 's a nice bunch of people on this trip -- nothing but class -- i looked over the passenger list and they 're all members of the who 's who !
never mind the who 's who -- before i get on this boat i want to know what 's what ! how about my raise ? all i get out of these ocean trips is dizzy .
clarence , i 've got something to tell you . i did n't just happen to be at the theater . i was paid to be there .
what are you , a theater checker ? you check up on the box office girls . make sure they 're not rippin ' the place off .
marty , i know i 've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future , but ... .well , those loud bangs on the tape recorder ... .are they ... .
professor -- there are some doors that should n't be opened , marty said softly , without turning around .
i did n't mean for any of this to happen .
oh , god , michael , i know . why does everything have to be so hard ?
hey , do n't `` mouthy shit '' me - i 'm outta here .
wait , petunia . mommy 's a little amped up - did n't get her yard time this morning . mink ai n't my bitch . she 's a specialist ... in banks .
sure , big guy . whatever you say . it 's your party . i 'm sorry i 'm in the way and dragging you down . maybe you 'd have a better time on your own . you take the car . i 'll catch the train back .
no , see , i want both of us to get crazy . we should both be cutting loose . i mean , this is our last chance . this is our week ! it should be something we share .
that has more to do with your proximity to me .
my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
lots of hair ... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out .
well , he must 've found some of the answers ...
chauncey , up and around this morning , are you ?
yes , ben . my leg is not very sore .
you tricked me . i would n't have - i 've never - never .
i know , but it was n't all bad was it ? i think you found it quite pleasurable . oh so soft . so sensual .
okay , saunders . what is it this time ? rocket in the leg ? machine pistol in the arm ?
q 's retirement party . i 'd just put the knife into the cake , and -
mm . i enjoyed the ride . sorry you did n't .
but wait ! sooze , i do n't wan na fight . i 'm so sorry .
i 've got to put these tapes in some kind of order ... and ... oh , i should get my sports jacket cleaned ... ... there 's coffee if you want ...
< u > you < /u > made coffee ? ... you 're going back to work < u > and < /u > you made coffee ? ... i love this !
commodore , i beg you -- please do this ... for me . as a wedding gift .
i am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition i rescue mr. turner ?
of course not . but she 's have to know eventually .
she does n't < i > have < /i > to know . she does n't < i > want < /i > to know .
we just cleared all four floors . no sign of him .
damn ! where the hell is he ? we should 've found him by now .
it 's real , brandon . all of it , it 's real .
i knew it ! ... i knew it ! ...
mr. duke tonight i 'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars , payable only after you provide american casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
-- yeah , yeah , yeah . you just have your hundred grand ready . for that you get the machete ... the mask ... the whole damn thing .
you see , captain , the situation is not as much under control as you believe .
my dear major , we are trying to cooperate with your government , but we can not regulate the feelings of our people .
who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil ? are you god ?
no ... no ... i 'm just a messenger ... he needs me ... a higher calling ...
you think you can stitch me up on you own ?
do n't worry , we 'll take care of it .
not unlike the way nicki met him . except it was a wrap party . why ?
i do n't know , i 'm just havin ' some trouble seeing you two together .
i 'm not going to faint , but if i want to faint , i 'll faint , okay ?
okay , but if you do i 'll have to perform resuscitation --
how can you say that ? especially after today ?
do n't try to focus on things as black and white , because you 'll go blind . there 's no winning and losing here .
in the sequel , james , two lady scientists should make a monster . and our monster would be gary cooper .
i would 've thought mr. leslie howard would be more your line .
i have a right to talk to her . she 's my daughter , and she 's beginning to understand why i 've sacrificed so much in order to achieve ...
you 've sacrificed ? ! if you 'd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents --
i would n't know what to do with it if i did .
well one thing for sure , you do n't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice .
a god damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half mustang . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?
about an hour and a half , because that 's all the longer i 've been gone .
keep it up and i just might make you my queen for a night or two .
you want a queen ? got one right here .
i do n't care if you 've been after her for six years ! butch , our whole lives are at stake ! are you going to let a woman come between us after all we 've been through ?
hello , max , hildy johnson . was there an old lady -- ?
yes , but i 've got the last footage he ever shot !
just , it does n't look like very much .
i was dubious myself at first . then something connected -- the village 's rock and the old legend of the sankara stones ...
dr. jones , we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors . i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist .
spock - what are you doing in this neck of the woods ?
i 'm flattered . twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me .
the way has been lost in time . but there is one person , a druid sor- ceress , who might guide you there . she was exiled by queen bavmorda many years ago . her name is fin raziel .
you need a warrior for this job . i 'm nobody .
this is a new car , then , sir ?
it certainly is , officer . still got that smell !
no ? well -- johnson , you 're under arrest . you , too , burns .
who 's under arrest ? you pimple-headed , square-toed spy -- do you realize what you 're doing ?
nicola anders is the only actress who can play that role .
it 's a re-make , hal . anders is not bigger than this picture .
c-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. i got sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let 's go out .
i still do n't feel safe leaving spencer with someone . how do you spell it again ?
i 'm just going to keep asking until you answer . i 'm sure there 's plenty of tape .
i do n't find this `` turning the tables '' thing very interesting --
uh ... huh huh . i have a couple . butt cheeks , huh huh huh .
yeah ! boobs . heh heh . i just wan na say that again . boobs . heh heh .
to you ? in front of him ? with the ...
yes . he assumed hank was your husband . he did n't know .
well , how did you like the class , david ?
it was the best thing i ever been to , miss johnson !
she 's just a kid . there 's time for more babies later . after she grows up .
dream on , auggie . she 'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday .
perhaps i had better stay . i am tired .
i 'll get ida to make up your bed .
don ciccio , i 've got an idea ... you remember that old abandoned movie house where they 're supposed to build those low-rent houses ?
so what 's that got to do with it ?
i 'll be back as soon as i 've got her far away and safe . we 'll hunt this fiend down together .
only if you 'll tell me who he is .
you did n't tell your sister about ripley , did you ? 'cause i do n't wan na go through that again .
forget about my sister . if karen sisco 's tailing glenn , we 're fucked . tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up .
that 's what i wanted you to tell me .
there are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world .
i sell bmw 's . what do you do ?
not much , actually . my software company just went public so i 'm just ... hanging out , really .
otto , we are mere mortals . you must never forget your own limits --
i 'll repeat the experiment . i will hold the truth . that 's the only thing that matters .
i 'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me .
i 'm just giving you the truth . there was a time when william parrish liked the truth .
please do n't tell anyone . this could ruin my career .
your career ? what about your family ? can you imagine the humiliation your father 's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer .
question , question -- the problem , what to do about 'em .
so ? what does he want to do about 'em ?
after this one , i 'm out , cat , you understand ? this is the last time we talk to each other .
remember harry 's story about the dry cleaner palmer was after ? guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline ?
about half of them . a lot of 'missing swimmers ' are really shark victims .
there 's a kind of a lone shark , called , uh ...
oh , so you do n't want war anymore ? you want to be at peace ? you want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it ?
i do n't understand . what do you want from me ?
no , i do n't want any clothes ! i do n't want anything ! i want to get out of here !
judy , you 've got to do this for me ! please !
yes -- she might think you do n't have true love on your mind .
would n't want that ... okay -- just one more .
cole , my god , boy , what are you doing here ? what happened ?
the bachelor party 's upstairs . they made me get naked . they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down ...
it is the way of all invaders . those they would conquer they divide , buying allies with promises of land and power .
we will hold . their power is not unlimited .
oh . well . we do n't really get along . paul and i .
i know . but you 've never met . it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him .
you 're not a man because of a job , duff .
you don ' know nothin ' 'bout it , baby . nothin ' ! and do n't kid yourself - you did your bit .
i can almost feel your doubt about what i 'm saying , mary .
i ca n't give up looking for her , mrs. redi , no matter what you 're hinting at .
do n't know . she keeps screaming to stay out . he keeps screaming to stay out . we decided to stay out .
well , there 's a good amount of agreement on that .
we ca n't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies . and we 've got to treat them as such .
look who 's talking ! the great white father , and world 's champion of women 's rights .
great . i 'll see you at the office at nine .
no -- not at the office . i 've got a better idea .
all right , master mind . but there 's something cockeyed about that joint and i 'm going to find out what it is .
oh , by the way , another pet theory of yours just blew up .
i know . i would bury it in the garden .
swell -- only this man does n't have a garden .
it helped more than you know . down deep , people were deeply affected .
you keep on saying `` deep '' and `` deeply . '' i wish something good would happen on the surface sometime .
leon 's in a bad mood , do n't get excited , he 's all right .
would you say this `` leon '' was actually lee harvey oswald ?
yes . theoretical discoveries aside , there 's nothing like the real thing . how about you ?
this is my second commercial flight . i used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast .
olaf tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage ... the whole time ... non-stop ... puke ... puke ... puke .
look ! i do n't feel bad about it . i just feel ill .
and who in god 's name do you think you are ... . ?
john hammond . and i am delighted to finally meet you in person dr grant .
you 've certainly thought this out , have n't you ?
i am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance , mr. nugent .
oh , yeah ? then how 'd you find my house ?
well , i asked the newsboy on the corner . he did n't know . then i asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . he was very helpful .
oh , you mean you ... fix the hearts ... of little babies ?
mostly ... little babies , but ... not exclusively .
i do n't want you to do anything . let your conscience tell you what to do .
that word again ! why do you keep saying conscience , conscience ... .
and that 's how felicity came into the picture . during one of those two seconds .
you 're conning me , sweetheart . i ai n't responsible for no baby .
-- the l.a. times has a huge interview with baldwin --
-- the lookout in the motor inn ? -- -- he say anything we do n't know ? --
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man 's wallet .
that 's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim .
and then ... what did she do ? agnes what did she do ?
she ... left me alone with that little thing , and i looked at it , and i thought this is a mistake . but it 's my mistake , not mommy 's . god 's mistake .
aghh ... i 'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow .
i would n't worry about it ... there might not be any little league tomorrow .
oh , i realized right away . he 's really a very nice fellow , hildy -- i found that out .
yes , he is ... look , bruce , we 're taking that next train -- and when i say next train , this time i mean it !
if i 'd gone public with this yesterday annette michaels might be alive today .
oh god brent , is there anything you do n't feel guilty about ?
y'know i wo n't be able to work for ya no more .
hey -- if a good man can make a better life , let him make it .
well , i do n't know ! i mean you 're a delicious , delightful , delectable little bird , but do n't you think you might be just a little tough ?
oh , i 'm tender enough for you , my boy . i 'm tender enough for you .
miss scott , you 're not making any sense .
i 'm afraid they 'll kill them ! we saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man 's heart out !
i do n't think that you would understand if i told you .
i think i understand without your telling me . i know something of your history , jason . i know that you have n't written for ten years .
we did for a long time . we just got married too young , and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things .
so he started having affairs , and you got depressed .
i 'm going to throw out these old videos .
no . you ca n't bin these . they 're classics . i 'm not allowing this .
he 's not done by a longshot , i can get more out of him --
he can wait . kendall 's out of surgery .
well , maybe we 'd better forget about it , then .
you ca n't prove it , can you ? you 're still trying to -- marriage license ! did you say -- ?
neither are we . something 's wrong with the game , mr. difford .
why do n't we take this into my office .
i love it . i just love , love , love , love it .
are you guys gon na fill this place with kids ? you sure got room for them .
how 've you been ? how 's teaching ? i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours , huh ?
i think they 're more interested in my epididymis .
'cause sometimes birds are attracted by light , you know . sure is a peculiar thing .
what are we going to do about it , al ?
mathematics is the only truly universal language , senator . we think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention .
if it 's attention you want i 'd say you 've got it . just one thing : why vega ? everyone 's looked at vega for years with no results , and now , yesterday , they start broadcasting primes . why ?
i 'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area , mr. president , given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
screw congressional oversight . i know damn well , going back to the '50 's , this agency reports what it wants , and buries what it does n't want congress to know . pay close attention to this .
to be closer . so that i could marry you .
what was the bribe ? what am i worth to you ?
are n't they precious ? ma'am , she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband . does she have any relatives in the area ?
no . well , her grandparents are down in oklahoma , but that 's it ...
you must also do something about the public meetings . i see this , memorandum circulating , with tibetan grievances .
you have cracked a man 's skull and that crack has not healed . it is too soon to expect him to be your friend .
i brought a pork chop , maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck .
no thank you , but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log .
why do you fret about something that is n't there ?
do n't say that -- i know it is --
all right . i 'll have to look for it .
mr. lombardo . we 're running kind of late . how about if nicole goes on to the mansons ? you could give me a ride when you find the ticket .
sod that . got ta get back before my probation officer wonders where i 've skived off to .
probation ? man , you crazy . they shouldn't 've let you outta your country , much less prison .
wally , the other two can still function , right ?
you do n't understand ... they 're a hive mind . it takes all three for their predictive abilities to work .
rose , we have a crisis . i am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against jim cunningham .
yes , i saw the news . something about a kiddie-porn dungeon .
i just need to run up and get my bathing suit .
okay . i 'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes .
rehab . outpatient . i have to go once a week . it 's kind of like aa .
oh , yeah , you had to go to highgate . that must 've been intense .
i am here to provide service to ... to all our guests . there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction . it is my duty ... to report this .
i hear you mac and i appreciate it . frankly i do n't know what i 'd have done without you on this one .
i asked you what you think of rosebud , now that she 's been here a while .
honey , she 's perfect . she works all the time and she 's wonderful with the children . and they love her , even brother likes her though he wo n't admit it . i think she 's just perfect .
oh , are we late ? there are no clocks in this town .
well , no harm done . this is lisa . i 'm sorry , i never got your names ...
i 'll tell you what i do n't do ... i do n't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest , stupid . show up or i break both your arms , we understand each other ?
ok , ok ... take it easy . i 'll show . tuesday i 'll give michael something . i promise .
a ground swell-christian movement , george , you see ?
no . as a matter of fact i have n't the slightest idea what you 're talking about .
i 'm not sure i 'll be able to ... i ...
< u > if < /u > ... if not , i 'll have the tape ... i 'll wait for you at my apartment .
oh my god jennifer . i should go to confession .
relax . carlton was torn apart . no way could you have done that . maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out ... or ...
but i 'm proud . i wrote , directed , and starred in it just like orson welles in `` citizen kane '' !
yeah ? ? well orson welles did n't wear angora sweaters , did he ? ? !
rose , that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again .
mrs. hillyer , i do n't know who he is , i really do n't .
... and , and , and did she ... ? and she did the seven shows ...
no , she did n't claire . but i think you should do the scene .
what was all that ? who was that man ? why would he shoot at us ?
i do n't know , some people just do n't like nuns . i wish i had a ruler .
never mind it ? that 's not my money ! that 's bruce 's money !
you 'll get it . now what 's the story ? i 'll have the paper send the money right down to you . i swear it on my mother 's grave .
i ca n't make this week 's payment and if this keeps up not next week 's either .
not next week 's either ... listen ... you tell that to giovanni , not me .
things so bad , nobody can help -- not even doctor maxwell .
doctors and nurses can only do so much , alma . they ca n't cure everything .
i 'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic .
we could give it a try . i 'll bring the wine , you bring the scarred psyche .
i just tell it like it is , mister . if i 'm getting on your nerves , though , you might want to think about hiring me .
do you have eyes in your head , or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles ? you 've been sitting here all day , and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas ?
you have anything to drink ? you want to go out and get something ?
i do n't drink , but you can go out .
like your father ... so human . all units functional , recorders are on ... scanning sector one . foliage in fully developed state of growth . temperature , twenty- two point two celsius .
sector two ... indicating desert terrain . minimal vegetation , temperature thirty-nine point four .
thank you , general . but there 's a price on my head . if i do n't pay off jabba the hutt , i 'm a walking dead man .
i understand . a death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... until our paths cross again , may the force be with you .
no . we have ways of digging out knowledge . but it takes longer . he is suffering from acute melancholia , together with a guilt complex . he blames himself for what happened to the woman . and we know little of the background .
i can give you one thing : he was in love with her .
and now ladies and gentlemen it 's time for the fabulous crocodile show !
great ! you could n't be a fan of dolphins or some other less threatening animal .
calm down , mister . you do n't want to get the cops in here do you ? you got a family ?
i do n't suppose you 've ever seen this girl before either ? her name 's kristen , but i suppose you 've never seen her ?
take your pen in hand , marquis . purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper ; maybe they 'll govern you less in life .
i 'll fill page after page , i promise .
< u > you < /u > did this ? you carved all these little figures and houses and things ?
i certainly did . i 'd finish it too , but ... i do n't get out much .
but what can you do ? there 's no way now . . .
i have to try , dammit ! something , anything . . .
he 'd die pretty quick , either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain .
can you ascertain if there 's proloid in his system ?
you can do anything you 've a mind to ... and bein ' a woman , you will ! that yours ?
yes , it 's ... nothing wrong with it , i 'm just ...
you look familiar ... have i ever threatened you before ?
i 've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates .
you want me to bring the vcr over here so we can watch this ?
i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin , in which case you 'll have to close the store tonight .
perfectly so ; and what is more , i will tell you that i love her , and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals .
very well ! now that i know it , i will no longer love her .
well , then put him at the singles table .
the problem with that is that then there 's one extra --
madrid has just blacked out ! ! nothing more coming through .
the same thing that happened on our pacific coast . anything from them yet ?
okay , i understand and i promise i wo n't try and stop you , but you ca n't just go ... look , come inside and talk ... just for a few minutes .
no ! ... please ... please do n't make me stay ... i swear ... if you do , sooner or later ... maybe tomorrow , maybe next week ... maybe a year from now ... i 'll go right out the window .
not this twig , friend . i got plans .
nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a man 's plans . we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you did n't plan on straying into town .
well , there 's a lot of communistic sympathizers around --
i know it ! but they 've got nothing to do with this case ! do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams we 're going to lose 'em ?
we 're back at the beginning . i still do n't know the why . a planet where apes evolved from men . a world turned wrong side up . a puzzle with one piece missing .
do n't look for it , taylor . you may not like what you find .
listen , pilgrim , you 're way out on a limb here . you do n't know what you 're into .
you sure as hell have n't been any help .
would you ? really ? wow . i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home .
haha . right . it 's no problem . i love making tapes .
yes . sure . what 's a steering committee ?
a committee of the majority party leaders . they decide when a bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list --
he exceeded his orders . his travel permit was promptly revoked .
yes , sir , so it was -- thanks to you . but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written ...
what 's the matter ... they never housebroke you ?
it 's not a joke . i got this terrible fear of being locked in ...
do n't go . i 'm frightened . i can love a coward , i ca n't love another dead man .
this is what i do . i do this every day .
a fort ! unconsciously , you chose a name that was belligerent . where were you nurtured ?
i take it you do n't believe the prosecutor 's charge -- that i 'm a monster created by dr. zira .
we 've got to get that valve turned off . their oxygen is almost gone ...
listen , i 'll go in , create a distraction . have this ... may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape .
you do n't think i 'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me , do you ?
i do n't see what else you can do , charles . if he 's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
one moment , friends , let 's give the senator a break . now , where 'd you say you studied law ?
well -- i have n't needed much law so far -- what i 'd like to get first is a little common sense --
look , we 're okay now . we just had a nice time . let 's leave it at that .
okay , that 's cool , okay . but the nice time we just had ... was it nicer , as nice , or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago ?
a trans am . that shit went out with new kids on the block .
yeah . who does he think he is ? knight rider ?
burke , just tell me one thing . that you 're going out there to kill them . not study . not bring back . just burn them out ... clean ... forever .
that 's the plan . my word on it .
you want to go for coffee after we send the girls off ?
no . thanks anyway . i 've got to get over to the office .
unfortunately we 're here as peace-keepers not peace makers , we ca n't take an aggressive role .
if the un changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed ?
it was easy money . i did it in the can . shit ! i learned the junk business in the can , paulie .
right in my face . you looked in my face and you lied .
a man who is not married has nothing . he is a man of trouble . you need a woman .
you proposing what i think you 're proposing ? do n't you think i 'm a little young for you ?
i 'm so glad to see you . you ca n't believe the people in here . they 've got patients posing as doctors ...
everyone says it 's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing .
sure , i ca n't last forever . i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper .
what would you do if it was a daughter ?
i had an unfortunate little run-in with him today . in fact ... you might say that mr. tyler is in big trouble with the ... authorities .
you better not mess with me , rhodes . i 'd love to serve your balls to those red coats for lunch ! think about it !
if ever i meet him again , you shall see which is the best man of the two . i 'll fight him with sword or with pistol , captain as he is .
but captain best is already known as a valiant soldier , and is famous as a man of fashion in london . it is mighty well of you to fight farmers ' boys , but to fight an englishman is a very different matter .
give me a list of those effects . i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed , no matter how insignificant .
it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information .
it 's feels unreal , like butterfly wings or ... something . it must 've cost dr. gaskell a lot .
i guess . walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things .
this kid 's ready but we wo n't know all the damage till we get in and see what 's happened . what have you got ?
nothing ca n't wait . shall we check it out with the major ?
how do you know what i 'm going to say ?
i do n't know what you 're going to say , but i think that ...
from pennsylvania . p.i . from pa. what are you doing out here ?
well , there 's the thing ; you 're not gon na know anything about what i 'm doing , but you can make some money .
but , as usual , it will not go well for ... them . martha , you must trust me .
you 're no fool , george . you never have been .
mr. scott . have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four ?
certainly , sir . how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker ?
who 's this 'bruce ' ? are you trying to make me jealous ?
i 'm serious , bruce . we have to -- !
that 's okay . it 's not really my business . i have wondered though . why was it ? was it like a nervous breakdown ?
i killed my mother and a old boy name jesse dixon . i thought they was a-doin ' wrong . i was about your boy 's age . they say i 'm well now from it .
why he 's that < u > big < /u > , i do n't know . why he 's < u > here < /u > ... the wetlands are being developed , crocodiles are moving . australia , fiji , the things have started to cross oceans .
but why < u > maine < /u > and why alone ? crocs are social , why 's this guy on the move by himself ?
some people starve , kid . until we can do something about it , they might as well see a movie . makes 'em feel better .
but i do n't want to be like that . i want to do something ...
-- that is a wild boast . you lack a knight 's humility .
not a boast , sir , but a curse . never have i met my match in joust or duel .
swell . i get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments .
i did n't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track .
miami beach is the only place for a real hustler . florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world . they lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes .
what 's all this sweet talk about florida ? your friend o'daniel got a stable down there now ?
hey , i 'm cruisin ' , man -- what 're you doing out here ? !
i want you to throw this one at the bat rack .
you do n't have to explain . did i tell you how grateful i am for what you 've done ?
i could n't leave you sitting by the road .
i wo n't . and when i tell drew about it , he wo n't either .
you wo n't tell him , and even if you did , he 'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the commencement speech at wharton .
what about dinner sometime , when you get back ? would that be ... ?
is this something you 're interested in ? i 'm not really that person i was .
could it be a glitch ? something the construction workers caused ?
unlikely . all cameras are frozen . do we call randy and phil ? tell 'em there may have been a break-in ?
-- brother of rustin parr 's maternal grandfather , somewhere after --
-- < u > whoever < /u > -- they built an entire house < u > around < /u > a < u > tree < /u > . sticking up right through the living room . somebody like to explain that to me ?
what the devil do you mean ? you have your lodgings , a certain stipend -- i thought i had arranged everything for you --
i saw the woman whose son 's body was delivered last night .
perhaps it came to me while dying in a californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little .
my husband didnt need to slap me about , mr lombard . i volunteered ...
it would be a nice night to go for a walk , do n't you think ?
oh yes , i think it 'd be a swell night to go for a walk . a nice long one .
we 've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out , but the killers may be among them . surely they 've disposed of these boots by now . would n't it have been logical to leave them on gorkon 's ship ?
even logic must give way to physics . gravity had n't been restored by the time they escaped . without their boots they would not have stayed on the klingon transporter pads .
just what the hell do you think you 're doing ? !
i do n't know what you 're talking about ?
you and i are going to move my father right now ... to another room on another floor ... can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out ?
absolutely not ! we have to get permission from the doctor .
why did n't moe green meet us at the airport ?
he had business at the hotel , but he 'll drop in for dinner .
up to you . i 'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that .
i get you loud and clear ... hey , you look nice .
you 're breaking up with me ? ! i thought you were proposing .
proposing ? ! elle , if i 'm going to be a politician , i need to marry a jackie , not a -- marilyn .
well , do n't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
uh uh . somebody felt much worse . and i 'm starting to understand why .
you could n't find your ass with both hands ... .
you leave me high and dry ... you come back looking like a zombie ... .
she 's amazing . she 's ninety-three , she 's a writer , and i told her about you .
wait , wait . you told her about me ?
yes ... a very slim one . i want to be fair . i do n't deny that you might make out some kind of a case .
we have n't anything to discuss with you . we 'll talk to a lawyer !
cartman ! what the hell are you talking about ? ! you love terrance and philiip !
yeah , but the animation 's all crappy - it probably ca n't sustain itself over ninety minutes .
your cumma ? what are you doin ' with your cumma ?
what else ? i gave her a schaff [ italian-american slang for 'tap ' . ]
i hope to spoil this sport , and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully 's body .
oh , it 's with pistols we fight . you are no match for best with the sword .
in the last six weeks you 've only been in my elevator once -- and then you did n't take your hat off .
well , as a matter of fact , i was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
maybe not . but you know more than i do . you know something about this box . something about a statue ?
yeah . i found it . i knew held like it and i figured ...
we all expect the world to be fair . as if we have some right t ...
i do n't mean everyone . just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them . or run a newspaper .
go . just < u > go < /u > .
thanks , kitty , i 'll never forget you for th --
no -- we do n't want this case in court .
neither does he . that 's where he loses . this man 's scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .
relax , alan . the army has this all in hand . and mr. thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news . nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate .
it 's not my job to relax . i 've put men facing out both ways down main street , so nobody can ride in shooting . i 've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case .
then putting them together . so truth is revealed .
but is n't the < u > truth < /u > that there are < u > several < /u > other ways to explain < u > each < /u > of these twelve pieces .
eight o'clock . shit . you 'd think my uncle would have left a clue , a note , something ...
that 's what serafine is searching for . without much luck , i 'm afraid . if only we could speak with him . but alas , he 's off in another realm , close to death .
donde vamos ? [ where are we going ? ]
a casa de porfirio zayas . he used to be a doctor on the other side . gunshot wounds , fixing babies -- if you can pay he can handle it .
i 'm afraid you 'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you . keep trying your father ; he 'll answer eventually .
i called another friend of mine and he 's coming over . will you let him in ?
you heard of a hacker called acid burn ? you know who he is ?
no , do n't know who he is . do you ?
this thing was rigged , the deck was stacked , the fix was in . could don king be near ? good thing sloan had my back . she 's my rock . this was going to be a whole lot of work .
david , i appreciate your comments . anybody got an ideas ? everybody just talk out loud .
and now you risk the same fate . if you are killed , your mother is all alone in the world .
i am harry james ' son , and will act as becomes my name and quality .
if you went away , what would become of me ?
i 'm grown up now . i have to leave some time .
maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy , rose .
buddy , sex do n't mean a thing to me . it ai n't nothin ' but a mosquito bite . i 'll tell you a secret . girls do n't want sex , buddy , girls want love .
why are you doing this to me ? ? do you get pleasure from hurting me ?
ah , pleasure ... that 's a difficult word to define . when does the pain end and the pleasure begin ... ? when did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand ... ?
of course not , but ... there are things we do n't understand .
if we wait until we understand everything we 'll be dead . come on . you can learn more from one kiss than from years in school .
i did n't learn ... i just ... it 's not a big deal .
buffy , i 'm gon na tell jeffrey you were playing with another man 's hebrew national .
okay . i 've uh , got some questions , from sue . that she thought might be better coming from me ... can you , you know , go to the bathroom ... like normal ...
yeah . you do n't wan na know the details .
do what you 've worked your whole life to do ?
it was just a job , there 'll be plenty of others .
actually . if you knew the exact route , you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over .
yeah , but you would n't have the truck if you blew it up .
do n't worry . we did the right thing with it .
what did we do ? joe , you 're not pulling one of your old tricks .
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands ?
`` the wrong hands '' ? we 're not talking about military secrets , john . they 're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off .
well , i 'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening , but if that 's how you go about your work , i 'd say you 're lucky to get through a whole day .
actually this has n't happened to me in some time .
i guess it 's time to hit the road .
yeah , do n't want to be late for my own funeral .
it 's your people who are leaking to the times . was n't this ellsberg a student of yours at harvard ? he was your idea ; why are you suddenly running for cover ?
he was , he was . we taught a class together at harvard . but you know these back-stabbing ivy league intellectuals , they ca n't ...
but edward , in this kind of a wish that does n't matter .
i can make wishes like this come true . i 'll be just like daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
then move not , while my prayer 's effect i take . thus from my lips , by yours , my sin is purged .
do n't you think anyone 's gon na notice that toontown 's gone ?
they wo n't care . who 's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future ?
no , jeff . i ca n't stay very long . can i have a frozen daiquiri ?
it 's on the way . i see you went ahead and cut your hair .
and i do n't need to know . so fuck you , i 'm goin ' to hollywood .
that 's right , big shot . unless you do what we want you 're not coming back .
uh , import-export . olive oil . right on 1/2 actually . in the vacant office . so we 'll still be seeing each other .
the vacant office . i see . olive oil . interesting . be warned , schwartz , there are certain doors which should never be opened .
close ranks ! goddamnit ! those sons of bitches !
frank , uh , you know i 'll try to contribute , but , uh -- freddy riedenschneider --
you mean , you could n't ? or you would n't ?
i do n't know , mon . the food lines took forever .
a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer . i 'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing : plumbers , aluminum siders , roofers .
not just imperials , is what you 're getting at .
they destroyed the simulator room and you with it .
the < u > kobayshi maru < /u > scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment . as i recall you took the test three times yourself . your final solution was , shall we say , unique ?
can you move the ice afterwards ? i do n't know nobody who can move ice .
not a problem , got guys waitin ' for it . but what happened to marsellus spivey ? did n't he always move your ice ?
which is why i 'm working < u > twenty < /u > hours a day , checking every variable --
every variable but < u > yourself < /u > . you do n't eat , sleep . you ca n't live in your head like --
do you miss having someone to talk to , hanna ?
i have my family . also our lord jesus christ .
what about our warp signature ? it has to be strong enough for them to detect .
i 've enhanced the plasma injectors -- do n't worry , they 'll see it .
they 'll kill you . you wo n't make it ten feet before they cut you down .
you do n't know john epps very well , do you ?
this is crazy . you ca n't escape like this .
probably not , but we 're gon na give it the old college try .
do n't you get it ? i do n't want to leave . this is who i am .
tell you the truth , i do n't give a shit for me . but that little girl is so special , and you 're gon na fuck her up .
just a habit . mr. schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around .
rumors ? rumors ? since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor ?
so , how do i fit into this scheme ?
the public loves you jack ... you do n't mind if i call you jack , do you ?
those are n't my friends . make them go away .
ray ! will you tell these guys to move back ?
now , my little coconut , what seems to be the trouble here ? tell daddy everything .
jimmy , my daddy 's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that ...
this is mighty sweet , paden . i think i finally found my place in the world .
well i 'm real happy for you , cobb . but i think i 'll keep looking for mine .
how come you 're not chasing it down yourself ?
look , i 'm junior man -- and it 's your beat .
just a crank making phone calls . happens a dozen times a day at the office .
our home , jim ! a kidnapper , a murderer , who knows !
daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet .
sure it is . freckle face , if i ever handled a minor felon like that , it 'd be all over the papers . i 'd catch hell . and this is the alleged murderer of the president ?
where has it been for the last seven years ?
that 's what we 're here to find out .
but if all i can give 'em is ordell 's name -- i do n't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- that do n't give me much to bargain with .
give 'em what you got . offer to help . show a willingness to be helpful . you want to stay out of jail , do n't you ?
you oughta use a rubber , pop . you really should .
what in the hell for ? you think i 'm gettin ' any at my age ? i do n't like blue-haired women . i do n't like 'em .
you 've just to love me and i 'll be the happiest woman around .
yeah , i know ! but for the moment you 're not yet a woman . so , be patient ... i need time ... and you too . you have to grow up .
i 'm glad things have worked out for you .
i think new york was just what i needed . so many people . i never feel alone .
oh . you mean , like , blair witch project ?
well , no . i 'm doing one on high school students , in fact .
sam , what are we going to do with you ? can you hear me , sam ?
where 's jill ? what have you done to her ? where is she ? !
valets , eh ? are n't we all la-de-da .
i thought you just wanted to check out the house , man .
you 're a bad , bad girl , stephanie .
i know . i might need to be spanked .
ace do n't ... listen , do n't ... do n't make a scene , all right ?
i want to just talk . i want to talk to that irish bitch .
i do n't know . he spoke to me last night on the boat . i liked him very much .
ah , yes , our paul , strong and silent and very sad -- quite the byronic character . perhaps i ought to cultivate it .
oh , your excellency , i do n't know what to say .
i would n't know what to say either if i was in your place . maybe you can suggest something .
now wait a minute . super 's the one made the rule . he ai n't gon na give you no helper .
he will if he wants us to go on blasting .
that 's what you told me two days ago !
will you please get back in your wagon ? and stay there ?
it does n't matter who we are . follow the tunnel to the end .
will there be someone to tell us where to go from there ... ?
thank you . why does he need you by him ?
he does n't . he needs nobody . but we have hunted many times ... ... he knows i am afraid of lions ...
i 'm sorry . it 's just upsetting . you 're in love with her . you do n't love me anymore .

not funny , ha , ha , funny queer .
well that 's a very offensive way to put it . you should n't say that . you were taught that , were n't you ?
that 's crazy ! why would i draw attention to myself like that ?
you like to play games , do n't you , peter ?
but i thought you said that he was rather ... simple ?
he is . i mean , i 've always thought he was . i think he must be . is he simple ? or is that just something i 've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself ?

well , i hope she was n't too much of a disappointment to you , lou .
naz dravi ! ... ..what do you like about this place , these people , chris ?

client ? i like to think of myself as more of a friend . a mentor .
max never had many friends . so much with the piano . always keeping to himself , it 's unhealthy ...
i 'll show you how to tell what 's going on . if things go south , you unplug me .
what is it with you ? why is it so important ? it 's a buzz , right ? like getting high .
the cops did n't try and strangle my ass .

i worked with spearchucker my first month over here , at the 72nd evac in taegu . most of the colored guys know who he is but they 're not talking because he asked them not to .
after what you saw last night -- after all you 've seen -- you ca n't just walk away --
i have . i did . it 's done .
she was very faint . i was barely able to reach her .
the deeper she goes , the harder it is to contact her . once she is below the second level , you will not be able to reach her at all .
i 'd love to . but are n't you supposed to meet up with simone ?
oh , yes . of course . do n't i always ?
mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial . i 'm confused . what 's changed ?
well , since that time , they 've killed one person during their trail . and since their incarceration , they 've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates .
i want to thank you , mr. o'keefe , for this time .

but look at what 's been done with hearts and kidneys !
it was n't one thing , if that 's what you mean . i just ... i ca n't live here anymore . i ca n't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue .
oh , you 're so much better than everyone , right ? no one 's worthy of you .

mrs. foster -- send a memo to bartholomew at security recommending that --

francie , you know i ca n't do that .
why ? it 's such a simple thing . you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again .
an experimental compound the romulans have been working on . in theory , a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon . but they never found a way to stabilize it .
why were they looking for it on a federation observatory ? it does n't make any sense .
-- simone , the question on everyone 's mind is simply ... `` why ? ''
frank , you know as well as i do , living in a fish bowl , the insatiable appetite of the media ...

i 'm sorry , but i do n't seem to recall the occasion . no , i 'm afraid ...
i 'm hardly doing a thing . the less i think of it the better . my parents are arranging everything . the gous are a very powerful family . my marrying one will be good for my father 's career .

so anyway , that 's the nightmare i 've been having lately .
do you suppose it has anything to do with lila 's unusually hairy body ?
oh no , sir . i putter with me hands .
well , is n't that nice ? you just go right ahead and putter with your hands . that 's all right . how do you do it ?
jack , she 's a fucking waitress in buellton . how would that ever work ?
why do you always focus on the negative ? did n't you see how friendly she was to you ?
if i thought i 'd offended her , of all people-
eve . i 'm fond of margo too . but i know margo . and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants .
brace yourself , gale , all of this is actually not about you .
all of what dewey ? you do know something , do n't you ?
sal ! sal ... goddamn it , sal , do n't you know anything ?
where are we going , merle ? are we going home ?

i 'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage . you wear the bars , you made the call , and you got your whole crew --
we did n't know we were compromised . firing would only 've given away our position .
they say you 're a whiz on fixin ' lawn mowers and things .
i 've tinkered around on 'em a little bit .
have n't you got a jacket or anything with you ?
no , i do n't , i uh ... it got burned up . everything in the car got the shit burned out of it . all i got left is what i have on ...
nobody could attack you . you set your life up like one of your chessboards . you 're impregnable -- but at the same time you 've become trapped behind your own defenses . you 're cut off from everyone around you .
what are you talking about ? you do n't even know me .
because next time it 's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined . if you 've no respect for your horrible self , you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you . he slaps alex on the knee .
a big black mark i tell you for every one we do n't reclaim . a confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole .
no , no . nothing like that . i work in a bank .

why do n't we just cut through the woods ?
howard ... what the hell ? what 're you doing ?
dogs ... season starts tomorrow . it keeps me calm . i do n't like going back into the same building four times .
the important thing is to find the right lawyer . one who will not protract the thing indefinitely , in the courts .

but this is life . this is n't a movie .
sure it is , sid . it 's all a movie . life 's one great big movie . only you ca n't pick your genre .
i though freddy was just an old town story .
it 's no story . it happened . freddy 's real and he 's back .

epps , you 're smarter than this . jaeger i understand , but you 're smarter .
you know it 's real . you know it 's real , and you know it 's there . you know it .
well ... now what ? what do , you have for us now . boiler ?
not much . nothing at all in this sector .
suit yourself , kid . this is n't for me to decide . of course , you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning .
yeah . i suppose i could . but , walter --
i do n't know , beth . i was n't there .
damn it , norman ! he 's lying . do n't you get it ? there is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he 's causing it . why ca n't you believe me ?
look it , mister ... you wan na have your way , you take it . i 'll do whatever you want . but you got ta let me go . you ca n't do this ! you ca n't keep me here !
you sick . you got a sickness ... we broke that fever ... we gon na break that hold the devil got on ya .
do n't get me wrong . i do n't care . but the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do .
i do n't `` rationalize '' anything . i 'm his lawyer -- he 's my client . that 's all .
i 'll tell you the problem . you behind the wheel . there 's your fucking problem .
that 's pretty simplistic , do n't you think ?
what 's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing .
c'mon ... you 're exaggerating . the orders were to shoot him in the back .
you know , you speak very good english , mr. escobar .
i went to uc san diego . we 're gon na spend the weekend at the universal sheraton . we 're gon na take the tour . see the shark . check out the miami vice action spectacular . after , we 'll come here , get our money .
so , i just come by to see how you 're doin ' ?
you broke my arm . how the hell do you think i 'm doin ' ?
hiding ? oh , no . hunting - i was in the interior - hunting fossils . this morning i looked up suddenly
i know - and a war broke out right over your head .
are you a resident of california ? you gon na fill out forms , man ? do the background check ? go through a three-day waiting period ?
sod that . got ta get back before my probation officer wonders where i 've skived off to .
it 's always some kind of an excuse . it's- you know , you used to think that i was very sexy . what ... when we first started going out , we had sex constantly ... we're-we 're probably listed in the guinness book of world records .
i know . well , alvy , it 'll pass , it 'll pass , it 's just that i 'm going through a phase , that 's all .
whatever it is , it 's out of your jurisdiction . this man is not a prisoner of war . not any more . he is a saboteur .
he is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage .
it 's just the god damned english doing everything by the book .
there 's no need for language , mr. hockley . go back and turn the heater on in my room , so it wo n't be too cold when we get back .
we are passing through the bassen rift . the projections will return when we have cleared it .
it 's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography ?
one word . you wo n't find it in the phone book .
listen , sonny ... can i call you sonny for short ?
we 're not going out two days before we set the record , it 's not gon na happen .
when they want us done , they 'll call in the harvard s.w.a.t team or some shit .
as in 'resulting in death . ' we pushed the envelope until it was n't even an envelope anymore .
if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it , i 'd arrest you right here .
yeah , sure , no problem , you 're welcome .
my daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe . is that true ?
can you guys believe this ? we 're like celebrities !
better enjoy it now . 'cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we 're nothing but a distant memory .
you told me that she was a little tall , but that she was n't bad looking at all .
millie 's been after me to fix her up with a date , so i ...
and exactly what changes are you trying to effect ?
i have this theory that we 're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we 've done to nature .
you need to remember who you 're talking to ...
i need to get my goddamn head examined . you ca n't rule something out on a whim . or because she 's cute . i 've been following your whims all across the u.s. of a. and now i 'm tired ! me !
carl makes me happy and that threatens this family , does n't it ?
does n't threaten me , honey . i 'm happy .
but -- you love him , do n't you , saunders ?
what are you talking about ? what difference -- ?
hi there . you took off so quick . i was n't sure if you were okay .
oh , yeah . sorry . i 'm fine . i just ... had to get home early .
c'mon ! the guy 's working with you . you always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
in this case , i ca n't . i - uh -- i just ca n't help you . i only would tell you -- that with joe , you are on very , very dangerous ground .
you can do it from up here , captain .
i 'd rather sit down for this one , elaine .
lucky for you . the grizzlies around here only go for joggers .
if i can survive rush hour , i figure i can handle grizzlies ...
fair enough . you know i got to admit , you got a lot of bark on you comin ' up here like this .
they were all gon na jump me back there . what ever happened to one against one ?
[ he has a heart condition . angina . he responds badly to stress . ]
[ ok. you will arrive at columbus circle and reforma avenue at 3am . you will drive around the square two times . samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to i.d . the car . ]
i ca n't believe his mother let him come over here .
right . well , she did n't , exactly ...
that be so , better you pinch yourself now , jack .
on the morrow i 'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true .
i got nothin ' more to say till i see a judge .
were you on hop ? you were passed out when you got arrested . were you hopped up , ray ?
sure , he just tried to throw me off the force last christmas as a little joke .
how 'd you like a little payback ? not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund . did you know loew was a swish ?
oh , yes , the lads frequently gather round the t.v . set to watch her for a giggle . once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish .
she 's a trend setter . it 's her profession !
i do n't recall . memories of the war , perhaps .
but that was so long ago . it ca n't still bother you .
what was that dell , i lost you , do you read me ?
yeah , but this is hard work . ca n't talk now .
you 've lied to me twice - i 'm sorry , but it will be strictly routine . these men are experts .
zlat , make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices .
it was a dream , you 're awake , you 're all right , now . can you tell me ?
it was the tower again ... and the bell , and the old spanish village ...
i do n't know . someplace called elmo 's . look , i just wanted to tell you that i 'm all right and i 'm on my way home .
you 've been through quite an ordeal , mrs. haydn . why do n't you stay where you are and let us pick you up ? we 'll fly you home .
not since last night . he took a guy hunting .
the fucker shot himself . ker-bang ! that 's what it sounds like . not on purpose . i assume accidental .
emergency transmitter ? what happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires ?
lets us watch each other 's backs over a wide area . only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths . elt was in my duffel bag , not around my neck where it should 've been .
do you talk to holly or lee behind my back ? do you ? you must . they- they seem to know so much about us .
well , maybe i 've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke .
typical army brat story . dad was noncom , mom was a nurse . there was never any real doubt of joining up .
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib .
uh , yeah , because the bitch shot him .
was there any evidence that mrs. windham shot him ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about . you 're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up . if you 'll only tell me about it .
i will , george . i want to tell you . i 'll burst with it if i do n't . it 's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable , but so beautiful ! well , as you know , we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
the men who came to see you at leavenworth . the one 's who made the arrangement ... who were they ? maybe i can talk to them .
miles . three other suits . that 's all i know 'em as -- suits . were you there ?
you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you .
i 'm not your boy . i do n't like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . let 's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
i 'm sorry to hear that . but you were n't close , were you ?
marvin says that rex 's will is four years old . he never redrafted it .
how did you find him ? it 's such an out of the way apartment . can i fix you a drink ?
no thanks . some kid at the american express office . are you living here ?
buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county . pilar looks away , struggling not to cry --
they ca n't pull this on me . it is n't fair -- i do n't believe this --
your father blamed you for your mother 's blindness ?
yeah , he hated me from day when i was born . put it out . can you put the cigarette out ?
why else would they approach us in this way ? it 's deniable . the soviets have done nothing but lie to us . this could be more of the same .
that may be why khruschev 's introducing this guy . we 've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels , so he brings in an honest broker .
well , if it 's as serious as all thatwe 'll move heaven and earth to
it 'll do no good . he despises me .
you told me you were n't seeing her at < u > all < /u > .
i did n't want you to be upset . i should n't have lied . stacy , there 's nothing between me and rachel banks .
why ? ... what on earth for ? look , hollis seems to think you 're an innocent man .
well , i 've been accused of many things , mrs. mulwray , but never that .
seems like they 're cooperating . hopefully i 'll be out of here and on my way very soon .
well do n't drag your ass . there wo n't be much of a window for us to link up . we 'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours .
why do n't you come to a commune with me ?
me ? i could never go to a place like that .
you 're really doing a great job here , josie . i like your `` can do '' attitude .
thanks . they were n't related to humpty dumpty , were they ? tweedle dum and tweedle dee ?
jim , you ca n't come here and pull that steamroller stuff . your methods wo n't do here . this boy is a senator , however it happened , he 's a senator . this is washington .
steamroller stuff , joe ? my methods do n't go in washington ? they 've done pretty well by now , have n't they ?
hey , angela , sal and i go back a long way .
he does n't want people bugging him , nick !
you 're making me feel so dirty and shitty . i feel like a big piece of shit right now .
are you gon na tell her what you 've done ?
ca n't say that i have . ca n't say i 've heard of a lot of people though .
if you do n't believe me , let 's watch this movie . see if his name 's on it . how about it , harry ? can i watch my damn movie ?
my son , no one can speak for god .
oh ? i thought you did so every day . so speak now . answer me !
is that bug juice , or are you just glad to see me ?
sorry . i 'm still getting the hang of this .
boy do i feel a lot better . it 's a straight shot back to the colonies , and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt . any bets on the top bid ?
well , we should at least be able to each buy our own planet .
thank you for that scientific analysis , mister smith .
hey ! you do n't need to be a scientist figure it out ...
he followed my birds into their coop . here , you want him ?
well i got to watch myself these days . know what i mean ?
you got that wrong , mister . i am .
okay , i told you what i wanted about minnesota fats . you just go ahead and play him , friend .
what is so incredibly great about new york ? it 's a dying city ! you-you read `` death in venice '' .
you did n't read `` death in venice '' till i gave it to you !
that is simple , is n't it ? i assume you can prove that if necessary .
oh yes , of course . there was someone with me . a lady .
did you see that ? how he gave < u > you < /u > the beers , not me ? i 'm telling you , he 's got something against workers .
i do n't know what you 're talking about , z .
i think i 'll keep that to myself . which way are the rooms ?
right through there . but i would n't go in there if i were you .
i know . he called again last night at tatum 's house .
see , it could n't have been me . i was in jail , remember ?
i want to wake up . i want to wake up , that 's all . i --
the door must not be opened . the barrier must not be crossed . do n't go on , doc . no matter how much you feel you have to . there 's more power here than you know .
my mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men .
then , she , < u > herself < /u > , possessed some knowledge of the greater world ... how pleased am i to see you looking so well ...
tommy . he . does n't mean anything . forget about it .
he 's insulting me . rat bastard . he 's never been any fuckin ' good .
we need a break , that 's all ! nobody 'd ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein !
but look at him ... and look at us .
you do n't smoke ... why do you want to start now .
because i 'm scared , that 's why . you never smoked ?
need a little help with that , mr collins ?
so , i put two million in cash in a los angeles bank under the name of mr and mrs tom collins . this was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money .
man , francis , you are one drug addled elitist freak , and when the revolution comes i do not want to be lined up with you and shot , 'cause you 're fucking ripe for political reeducation , you know , like in the fields .
paul , cancel your mental appointments , baby . what are you , like still stoned from last night ?
listen , we know their names . they do n't know the city . you 'll find them . you 're the fbi .
i ca n't bring the bureau into this . if i do the tapes become evidence .
what makes you so special that people should pay attention ?
not me . i 'm not special . i 'm not exceptional . this is , though . what i 'm doing .
your car 's leaking either transmission or brake fluid . i want you to have it checked asap at a gas station .
you got it , dad . i 'll call you if i have a problem .
whatever you say . the manager says your boss called . really pulled the wool over everybody 's eyes , huh ?
what are you talking about ? so i 've got a job . so what ?
you know dr. maximus , our commissioner for animal affairs ?
certainly , sir . it 's a pleasure to see you again .
alright , listen up ! i want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double ! let 's move it !
you heard what the man said ! move it !
and what in heaven 's name brought you to casablanca ?
my health . i came to casablanca for the waters .
let 's call it a night . i ca n't take any more .
right . we can pick up on the rest tomorrow .
this portal is mine and must be sealed up forever . for the love of god .
with all respect , sir , i discovered that portal . its my livelihood .
facing north ... i 'd hate to commit myself without my compass ... pardon me ... are you an explorer ?
no ... i am looking for the eiffel tower .
unh ... unh man ... i do n't take no money from friends that need help . fuck no . what do you think i am a bum ?
not at all . i 'll catch you later .
dear duncan , my affection is as towards a closest friend . alice and i depend on you and respect you immensely ... i wish they did , but my feelings do n't go beyond that . do you see ?
is n't respect and friendship , a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined ? and all else may grow in time ... ?
she dropped a million and half dollars to the house -- your house . and you didnt even bat an eyelid . she was paying you off . what for ?
as ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks .
yeah right ... if i 'm so cool , why have n't i had a girlfriend in four years ? i ca n't even remember the last time a girl talked to me .
i 'm talking to you ... i 'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute !
they said you were drunk . why do n't you tell her the truth ?
she 'll think it 's her fault for keeping me .
no more neutral zone . i was used to hating klingons ... that 's why i failed in our assignment . it never even occurred to me to take gorkon at his word . spock was right .
well , do n't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
i have my family . also our lord jesus christ .
of course . how is the old boy these days ?
a man has my family . gold watch here . dark tan .
that would be glen howell . he was on his way for the disks .
wait in the hall ! i have to get dressed !
tell me where is jack foley , i do n't bother you no more .
he did n't even lose a limb , an eyeball ... bladder control ..
point is , listen to them . they 've lost faith in old symbols . they 're ready to bond with you , the icon of the future . if it works , do n't fix it ...
yeah but you do n't even know me really .
sure i do , you know , like your aura . that you give off .
could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you 're getting ready for a date .
it 's not a date . it 's co-workers going to a professional conclave .
i 'm sorry , sir , we do have to charge you the four dollars .
i just pulled in here . i just fucking pulled in here !
oh brother . dorothy vallens , seventh floor . look on the mailbox for her number , bright boy .
thanks . dorothy vallens . okay , goodluck . three minutes , no sooner .
god , i would love to think i 'm an interesting teacher . i mean , i had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all .
you do . seem to . have passion . in the classroom .
you were going to kill me ? drink my blood ?
yes but you need n't worry about that now . things change .
four . you had four leads . one kicked out , one the judge , you say ...
... you want to see the court records ? john ? eh ? you want to go down ...
they know what you want , believe me . pretending is just a waste of time . you 're gon na take them there eventually anyway . do n't apologize for it .
i 'm just trying to be a gentleman , show some respect ...
do you mind ? i'm-i 'm my own person .
can i take you someplace to hear something nice ?
that was nice of you to think of that .
i made you a gin and tonic . it 's by the side of the sofa ...
you 're a pms werewolf . of course . frida , are you on drugs ?
no , last night i think i chased carlton around as a wolf and killed him . i woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed . and my throat hurts .
come on , george , no one is going to pay that .
it 's already been negotiated . it 's done . the money is there waiting .
okay . twenty thousand . ten now . ten there .
< u > no < /u > . no , that was too easy --
yeah , or d , it 's a dumb fucking idea ...
then what do you want to do , miles ? run ?
it always gives me a funny feeling to come home . dear old southland . gone . it 's all gone , daddy -- -- except you , you 're still here .
not for long , boy . i 've outstayed my welcome already .
mr. scott , get the transporter working . if we contact a rescue ship we 'll need it . which way to the turbo shaft ?
head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right . then left at the blowscreen . you ca n't miss it .
no breach-of-promise case has been filed . the matter has been settled out of court .
oh i see , but gloria does n't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars .
put the sense/net police on it . the matrix is their turf .
sense/net 's corporately financed . too corrupt to be trusted . you of all people should know that .
we do n't want to tire you out , dear .
stands and picks up her handbag . pauline stands and juliet grabs her hand .
nick ! nick ! there 's someone to she you ,
that 's great . i was afraid i 'd have to go to sleep .
look -- i got ta be clear with you . tony clifton is not andy kaufman .
yeah , yeah , yeah . i know ! wink wink ! nudge nudge !
no , just - just give him , give him ten . that 's it . ten . i 'll be right down .
he 's gon na come up with ten thousand , just the way you wanted .
then they were n't created to go after your `` patient zero '' .
no . they 've been training to hunt you .
your majesty , i 'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony .
but general -- this tunnel is your baby ! you 're sure you ca n't stay ?
scared ? swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours . i was petrified .
come on , you loved it . it was a new experience .
yeah , yeah ... ... i like to fuck shit up .
i 'll bet you do ... how much we owe ya ... ... goober ?
but then he had to cover up , make her seem just like all the rest of them . that 's what lecter was hinting !
the market in lecter hints is way down , today , okay ? i 've got two good men dead in memphis , and three civilians . i 've got -
yeah , i have n't really absorbed that one .
well , i 'll just make it for you .
i 've been around here six months and i still ca n't get over it .
it 's like , every day i see a beautiful woman . i 'm not used to that . i 'm used to seeing a beautiful woman , i do n't know , once a week . i ca n't handle it .
this ship is going down in a blaze of glory !
well blaze your ass out of there ! you 've completely altered your trajectory , are we linking up or not ? !
dear , dear , dear . whatever happened to you , my boy ? mr. alexander , now confined to a wheelchair , pushes himself away from his desk , and rolls up to julian . the water drips off alex 's clothes . they look at each other .
the police ... the horrible ghastly police . they beat me up , sir . the police beat me up , sir . mr. alexander stares at him . it becomes apparent he is insane .
that 's easy . there was . he 's dead .
i 'm sorry for asking . i forgot we said `` no questions . ''
one loud scream will bring them in here instantly . you wo n't get very far . think it over .
if i were here to hurt you i would have done it already .
you think it 's me ? you think i 'm saying there was a conversation when there was n't ?
i do n't know , beth . i was n't there .
let me handle this part . do you mind ? why did you go to carlos ' hideout ?
he wanted me to go with him on a mission , to pose as him wife .
and who 's gon na run the projector until you get back ? mrs. terwilliger ?
maybe we could train cat to run the projector . you know , a system of scratching posts , and gears , and levers ...
how come ya wan na hang out with those guys ? they teach ya bad things .
i like 'em . if you do n't you can f --
i 'm at work , asshole . where else ?
elaine ! i ... i 'm sorry ... i was expecting somebody else ... police business .
i have a certain function to per- form , and that seems to take all of my time . bu sometimes - uh - i speculate - uh - i have n't left room for - uh - anything else .
i 'm sorry to say i know what you 're saying .
jesus maria ! i should have never listened to you !
you never did . you did all the talking for both of us , remember ?
you want me to wear white for you ? you must be madder than i thought ...
but ellen , i told you i have stopped ...
max , as i was saying , maybe we should go easy on the spending . i mean these offices and everything .
why ? take it when you can get it ! flaunt it , baby , flaunt it !
let 's get out of here , this place makes me sick .
we have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before i start my stupid job .
i do n't know , sounds thin to me .
you want to stay here , while cuervo jones rules the world ?
yeah . i got some stuff for your cut .
i could n't believe ... did you see the size of that thing 's mouth ?
and smooth ... almost no movement - back and forth , i mean .
like you 'd get if it was hand held .
and speaking of which , here 's the light of my life , the pert and saucy miss julie mcelroy .
i had to park two blocks away . is something -
you mean the little chippie he was with at the el macando ?
yes . she 's disappeared , has n't she ?
okay . i think he 's into some sort of new personal improvement cult .
well ... send my love , if you see him again .
if you knew it was bad for you why did you do it ?
i could n't help myself . you get lost inside a women like her . it was like a drug . it was the best sex i ever had .
oh , i 'm fine , i 'm wide awake . what 's up ?
well ... hal 's reported the ao-unit about to fail again .
you do n't want to worry about that . my grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice . in my opinion , jaundice is not very serious . drink up .
why did n't you come sooner ? it 's been over two weeks .
i chose not to choose life : i chose something else . and the reasons ? there are no reasons . who need reasons when you 've got heroin ?
goldfinger 's better than dr. no . both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office , in which field , of course , thunderball was a notable success .
before you went over to the germans , before you got rommel 's spy across the desert and inside british headquarters . he took some pretty good photographs - i saw mine in that torture room in tobruk , so they made an impression .
and you thought you 'd come and settle the score ?
you certainly have not , you 've been very helpful , and you 've shown a genuine desire to reform .
father - may i ask you a question in private ?
cut it out . just cut it out , okay ? it 's starting to get on my nerves .
when i told her i was going to bring her father , she kind of melted . it 's the first time felicity 's talked nice to me since she left home . she 's dying to meet you , auggie .
you ai n't got no credit card but you got a lawyer . sweet talk me all you want . did n't you read the sign ? it says ...
what sign ? fuck the sign . i want my car .
no , mr. gittes . that 's what i am doing with the valley . the bond issue passes tuesday . there 'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir . i 'm doing it .
there 's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they 're paying for water they 're not getting .
nothing you got ta say do i wan na hear right now . so save yourself saying it .
i 'm not in here to apologize , john . i told you what was gon na happen & it 's happened ? `` good-bye , princess , '' & the same night she gets attacked ? that 's a tough one to swallow , bro ?
he 's not there . huggie bear is n't in every single episode .
i think you might of dreamed this one , anthony .
the stones will be here . i 'll see to it personally !
... i ca n't wait to be among you .
not anymore you do n't . it 's obvious .
i ca n't believe you 're reacting this way . you 're just saying this because you lost the bet .
how 'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world ? right now . i can do it if i get out .
they 'd look silly on me . i 'm fourteen years old !
yeah . you got the whole story just right .
beware of the puget debs -- and we all laughed , especially him .
you see the sign ! it 's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time i 'm gon na charge you ! $ plus one dollar is $ !
keep the change , you son of a psycho !
look , sid , why do n't you take off ? disappear for a few days . i 'll come with you .
no . i will not crawl under a rock . this is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time . i 'll just get used to it .
he takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us . he makes us quit the life at thirty . he does n't let us use narcotics and he does n't abuse us . can your policeman 's mentality grasp those contradictions ?
he had you cut to look like veronica lake ?
why do n't you answer the man , sidalee ? he 's trying to take you off the hook .
you just had a good example of it . a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna .
she says that she 's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened .
sit down , i have something to tell you .
exactly ! so i dug it , and i did a lot of research .
do you really , you really , like shostakovich ?
why do n't i set you down here and we wo n't argue about it .
i want you to take me to another motel .
i 'm a-tryin ' , ma . honest i am .
you got ta keep clear , tom . the fambly 's breakin ' up . you *got* to keep clear .
she 's ... ill. confined to her room . it 's practically living alone .
if this girl mary crane were here , you 'd have no reason to hide her would you ?
am i fired ? you wan na hit me ? what ?
i do n't particularly want to talk to you .

what are we going to do with him ? we ca n't dump him in the street .
bring the car round back . i know a place upstate they 'll never find him .
are you < u > crazy < /u > ?
the man would need protection , obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him .
and i thought my mother was the master of guilt . geez louise .
silence ! ! ! now ! ! ! everyone bow down to me ! ! !
do n't give me a hard time , mr. gordon . i 'm just --
doing your fucking job . i know . i watch television too .
we all agreed to it . you had no way of knowing bastaldi was setting us up .
i just want to live long enough to get back to paris . just long enough to kill bastaldi .
he 's leaving the country . and i do n't give a shit .
the blood type on the rocks matches suzie 's .
yeah . he 's a respected scholar . even no-am chomsky says he --
billings , if hitler did n't kill six million , why is he your hero ? ... concentration camps all over europe , and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand ... . he 's a putz .
at least he did n't swing with your ride .
no , but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day , know what i 'm saying ?
chancellor , may i present commander spock , whom i believe you know , dr. leonard mccoy , chief medical officer , montgomery scott , chief engineer ...
commander , face to face at last.. you have my thanks..

i could come up with grand in a day if i had a reason to .
he says you were bar mitzvahed there , in march .
you believe that ? and you call yourself a reporter ?
then you 're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole . now why do n't you just take your visa express silver card , call karl malden and have him send you the money lickity split .
i do n't have a credit card . they took my wallet .
yeah , he 's got to go to work , has n't he ? you think he 'll come down for that ?
no , but he 's looking after the money , so what 's the problem ?
why do n't you just go back to your pickin ' , homer ? i can take care of it myself !
rose , listen -- do n't *do* anything . you know , i mean to yourself . please listen ...
i 'm not exactly on the other side of the room .

do you realize that you 're accusing me of ... .
the patient was in great distress . naturally he was ... yelling .
and was he in distress when you opened the door ? or was he sitting here , relaxed , at this table ?
and what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do ?
a soldado , he runs messages and materiel between the regiments ...
it 's only two-thirty . what , are you tired ?
yeah , charlie , i got my second wind three nibbles back .
i tried to keep you in good with johnny .
you do n't understand ! i could 've been a contender . i could 've had class and been somebody . real class . instead of a bum , let 's face it , which is what i am . it was you , charley .
i 'm incapable of such an act , and so are you .
i think the facts speak for themselves . the same noble picard blood runs in our veins . had you lived my life , you 'd be doing exactly as i am . look in the mirror , and see yourself .
sorry , jazz . after this , i 'll throw a burger down your throat , okay ?
you 're a fucking gentleman . what do you want from me ?
what do you want to tip me for ? look , you got to spell it out . whatever you want , just say it .
i 'll give you a tip . here 's forty dollars .
we just discovered him , your honor ! his appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case ! he is an inmate at ossining correctional and --
-- objection , your honor ! this case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with !
amanda and i , well , we just love the outdoors . heck we 've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with : galapagos , k2 , the nile ...
we even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight .
er , very nice harry . what 's it for ?
do n't play innocent with me bazza ; spanking !
michael , you represent drug dealers , not civil libertarians .
we kidnapped noriega out of panama . is that covered in your constitution ? because it is n't in mine .
friends ? you 're crazy ! in my building , before , they just cared drugs all day and you could n't get one , or they just cared video games and you could n't get one , no more .
you 're darkening the picture , are n't you ?
i do n't know . i mean yes , probably .
yes positively . that 's where he was drowned ...
it 's not what you think . okay , maybe it is ... .
you really went and did it . with one day , not even a day , of planning , you did it . nobody does it better , hudson . you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex .
oh , that 's nice , louis . i 'll stop by if i 'm around .
you know you should n't leave your tv on so loud when you go out . that creep down the hall phoned the manager .
dr. duval , you are not going through with this ! i absolutely forbid it ! i 'm responsible for the lives of everyone here ! i will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship !
i 'm going to do what i can to save benes .
i do n't know , myra , i never had partners . i never needed them .
not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks . but how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand ?
where are you now -- can you meet me ? do you know les halles ?
yes , where ? -- in fifteen minutes . i 'll be there .
then i hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids . what do you want ?
i want to arrest you for murder ! i want to shake your hand and reload your gun ! i want to kill my pride and give you my blessing .

you run along -- i want to fix my face .
do n't forget to kill the lights . see you monday .
well , my career takes up a lot of my time .
do n't tell me you 're waiting for lightning to strike . wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species .
a decent life ? excuse me ? as what ? a janitor ?
clearly , you have learned nothing . and you present an ongoing threat , both to this convent and to yourself .
... i 'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about ! or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin , when if they 'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts ...
they ca n't . i think it 's against human nature to admit to that level of ... insignificance ; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe .
well , `` admiral , '' that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story i 've ever heard .
you asked . now , will you tell me something ? george and gracie 's transmitter . what 's the frequency ?
i want to sleep ... i have n't slept for three days .
you will remember the name ? von scherbach ? von scher-bach !
i 'm not a hire car . it 's against regs ?

lasher will act , rowan . whatever it is he wants - he 's waited three hundred years to have it . facing him alone ... i do n't like -
lasher is my legacy - not michael 's . aaron , i 've seen the pain in michael . i ca n't bear to see anymore . he 's not to know . swear to me .
-- skip . knowing what you do about me --
doc , i trust you ! you 've listened to me better than anybody ... maybe ever . and this secret i 've got , i ca n't stand it anymore . i do n't know if i 'm some kind of --
hi , santa claus , how are you . he 's with sears , i 'm with wal-mart , twas the season ...
we 're all outta gifts , boys and girls , but we got charitable donations !
you through , mr. wizard ? let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you 're at it . hell , it 's only 7:30. the night 's still young ... you can solve this case and start on another one .
well , what 're your ideas on these guys ?
let me try to get to her . i 'll deactivate her .
what does that mean ? i do n't want to be involved in anything unsavoury .
dave , the budget 's a very complicated thing . even i do n't understand it sometimes . now occasionally we have to make some cuts and ...
but we went there . we saw those kids .
i got to hand it to you , homey . that 's the best preacher hype i ever did hear .
it is n't a hype , shorty . and i meant what i said : join us .
hard to argue with that , is n't it ...
a date ... coffee ... a drink ... a walk in the park .
you 're crazy -- it should be like two dollars !
i was wearing that dress the day i lost my virginity .
you understand that we have lost all contact with captain kirk ... ?
at present , he 's surrounded by a magnetic shield . if my calculations are correct , he should be deep into his escape planning by this time .
it 's really nice up here , is n't it ?
i love it . i really do . i 've never been this happy , or comfortable anywhere .
i did n't write anything else 'cause nobody , including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one .
well , i 've read you colleagues . your book was good , sean . all those guys were in your platoon ?
why do you think marty came here tonight ? because he cares about your department . you do n't know how hard he works . you do n't know about his programs helping west side --
-- all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt .
send the fleet to the far side of endor . there it will stay until called for .
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust ?
edward , are you sure you know what you 're doing ?
yeah . it seems a little crazy , but sometimes < u > you just know < /u > . she 's perfect for me .
oh , now , do n't rub it in .
i 'm not rubbing it in . well , i guess we better run along .
wait a minute . i 'm not that neat , maybe , but i am clean .
well , you 're not that bad , but some people ... i mean , people 's homes , just filth . i 've been in people 's homes ...
johnnie , i ca n't tell you , honey . is there anyway we can get on the road tonight ? we 've got to find them kids .
somethin ' was upsettin ' you bad last night , and you wanted to tell me and i figured you wanted to tell me so 's i could help ...
hey junebug , when all this is over we should get the band back together again .
yeah . sure . once tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go .
it 'll be better for us if he simply disappears . the gardener will know what to do .
wait , wait , can i at least have his body ?
it 's my birthday . i 'm seventeen years old as of forty-seven minutes ago , and i think i should celebrate having made it this far .
hey , hey . happy birthday . why did n't you tell me ?
i do . and i practice with them . at least three hours a day .
you need to find yourself a girl . or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you 've found one -- but ca n't get her ?
this huge police presence tonight is n't necessary , lieutenant . you 'll just scare people off . i can handle the security behind scenes with this system . it 's state of the art .
the cops are non-negotiable , ippolito . why do n't you just tell me how this space station works .
that would be wonderful , but it 's only been a year since andrew died .
what are you afraid of ? what people think ?
hoh graphic ! i 'm going to dream of ears for a year ! ugh !
just be thankful he was n't dissatisfied with his sex life .
well we know that but what 's he doing here ?
well , me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good .
so you think this is worth a thousand dollars , do you ?
oh , the chronicle would consider it dirt cheap .
look at that . he 's got four apes with him .
that 's what i like about these guys , j.j ... they always got protection against things we 'd never do to 'em .
`` half ? '' what did you , take a nap in math class ? three people , three shares , one third . four point six six six repeating .
i 'm just saying , the man is a problem . and he 's your problem . was n't me idea to bring him along .
not for the pentagon it is n't . i 'm kissing mao 's ass . and the press is gon na find some way to shaft nixon on this one .
it 's not the press that matters . nixon 's wife is proud of him .
it 's been six months and i 'm just starting to get over it .
oh , god . that 's two more than me . tell me it gets better .
space for what ? to o.d . like that other kid ? i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents . because it is n't . correct ?
we do n't want to push her away . these are growing experiences .
martin , when we build up our tax base a little , you can have every- thing you want ; right now , the town 's broke .
please , larry -- there 's good reason . those water skiers ... .
wonderful ! ! ... wonderful to see you , pete . how are you ?
feeling good , arnie . ready to get to work .
we know what 's down there . we did the loading ' and unloadin ' when the stuff came ashore in the early days . a direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o ' damage .
a direct hit 'll blow the top off this whole island ! how 're you gon na fuse the stuff ? how 're you gon na leave yourself time to get out ?
if you 're home it means either jack and bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you , or --
-- we got a back channel communication from khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal . he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president . i think we 've won .
besides , think of the drama i 'm sparing natalie .
i say hang the bastard out to dry , let her see him for the heel he is , then maybe she 'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain .
virgin birth -- ha ! an entire religion , built on an oxymoron !
orvolle . his wine . from now on , nothing but water at every meal --
when is the funeral ... ? i am coming to my mother 's funeral ! !
out of the question rowan , coming here will not change the -
i did n't think she 'd dare come back to peking !
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu ?
i do hope he 's all there ... if you take my meaning . i would hate to see master luke develop a short circuit ...
the kid ran into something mean , and it was n't the cold .
what do you mean , you 'd rather die alone ?
i did n't say when i want to die -
well , if it 's my last story , i 'd like it to be a good one . but -- i guess i ca n't , walter .
suit yourself , kid . this is n't for me to decide . of course , you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning .
yes . i must have been pretty much plastered if i hired a valet .
oh , but you did n't engage me , sir .
no it 's not . do you know how you did it will ?
it 's in the transcript . what does it matter now ?
say , bill ... you ever ... ever go into town ... an ' all ?
sure , i got to . got to get supplies .
excuse me , monsieur rick , but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs . the cashier would like some money .
well , i 'll get it from the safe .
no ! not the police ! do n't call them !
i have to . if a complaint is made and the person resists obser --
the one direct , decisive , intelligent act of your life !
i do n't think so . it could have been .
show a little respect , nero . the man was an important artist .
yeah , important for your label . which no doubt is why you 're in mourning . do n't worry , his records 'll sell out now he 's dead . you 'll make out .
yeah , that 's him . buddy says glenn thinks you guys are real cool .
he did , huh . well , tell buddy i see glenn wearing his sunglasses i 'll step on 'em . i might not even take 'em off first .
i 'll have bearing and distance for you , sir .
right . now look : i want you all to be very careful . this is terra incognita . many customs will doubtless take us by surprise . it 's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before .
roger , enough with the fucking donuts ! what did i tell you . stop bothering mickey , and get behind your nagra .
fine . roger , what the hell are you doing ? you 're bothering the serial killer .
gregory  you 'd better take jacqueline with you tonight .
it 's what i should have done yesterday . i 'll take her away somewhere where she can rest .
just another bureaucratic foul-up . you know how these pencil-pushers are . so , why do n't you just run on back and explain what happened ?
funny , i was just thinking you should do the same . since i am already in residence , and am obviously the man for the job , it 's been grand making your acquaintance , sir . and best of luck in all your future endeavors .
this is an important mission , sgt . whitman . i hope you realize that .
oh -- you do n't wan na know what i think . topside , now .
jack 's sort of sensitive , i guess . more than most . but he 'll be okay in a few weeks .
there 's something funny about that shooting . there 's lots funny about it , actually .
you tell me you want these guys off your back . next thing i know , you 're saying yeah , maybe they can have a piece of mr. lovejoy . i could n't believe my fuckin ' ears .
i said i 'd think about it . what does that mean ? in this town , nothing .
he 's right about one thing . we do have to survive .
you do n't have to hunt to do it .
i do n't know ! get me out ! !
catherine . listen to me . i have to find a rope . i have to leave this room , just for a minute , but -
that 's very thoughtful , honey . it 's just a slump . things will pick up .
but when john f. kennedy 's elected president , men'1l stop wearing hats .
according to the backer 's list you raised $ 60,000 . but the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand . there 's two thousand dollars unaccounted for .
i went to a turkish bath , who cares ? the show was a flop . what difference does it make ?
quite a pair we make . thank you , jeff .
a couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together . thank you , jeff .
jones is n't in his room . miss scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to delhi --

i was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is ?
i 'll never meet the man of my dreams .
you and the other % of the women in the world .
paul , i 've sent my soldiers to rescue the lady prime minister , she 'll need a room .
yes sir , but these people they can not stay here . i 've heard you have a refugee center at the airport stadium ?
it takes that much time to process the order and make sure it 's valid --
i had this whole thing in my head , i was gon na be able to get this to you today -- i have to leave today --
i just figure the percentages . he would n't try a cross until he 's got the money .
let 's send his cut back -- just keep going .
i do n't know - i 'm not sure it 's a good idea .
of course it 's a good idea ... it 's our plan .
we 're going to make it back , grant . three or four times over .
and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow .
we went down to chinatown but they do n't have any .
yeah , well , keep away from those chinx . they do n't have shit .

finch , do n't you think it 's about time you learned to take a dump at school ?

the world is what you make of it , friend . if it does n't fit , you make alterations .
i 'll drink to that . will you join me , miss --
i work too , but i still make time .
tina , what do you want me to do ?

i must have left my appetite outside , which is where i think we ought to be right now .
edie , listen , stay out of this mess . quit tryin ' to ask things about joey . it ai n't safe for you .
why worry about me ? you 're the one who says only look out for yourself .
you do n't want me to live with you ?
how- i do n't want you to live with me ? how- whose idea was it ?
you must know i always ... did you really mean all that about moving in with me ?
i was just thinking out loud ... i mean , you 've got this whole thing with dana -- i 'm not going to let you fuck that up ...
why not ? he keeps marrying girls all the time !
but you 're not a girl . you 're a guy ! and why would a guy want to marry a guy ?
are you tellin ' me i 'm not good enough to drink here ?
this bar is for bikers and truckers only . you , get out !
i made only the first two . the others were done by hacks .
still . you must be rich . making a couple of famous movies like those .
i kept looking back , like you taught me . i did n't see anyone .
okay . it 's just , things are a bit hot for me right now . if i get a signal ... i may have to leave suddenly .
we didnt quite make it as lovers ... leon is a good man , though ...
did leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved , rhian ?
come on . just tell me . it 'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms .
honestly , the suites are all about the same .
we 've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the son'a .

< u > i do n't wan na know you ! < /u >
you were right the first time . is this like , solitary ? the cooler ? where 's the furniture ?
our lives are simple . we have little need for material possessions .
we 're outa here . lieutenant , get your men into the skimmers . this real estate 's about to go buggy .
hey , just calm down , i 'm giving the orders here-
i said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned , because he sounded real concerned .
look at that , we did n't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all . now , do you know anything about that ?
you have my absolute assurance , your majesty , that napoleon does not have the strength to attack st. petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied , and he would be defeated if he attempted that .
i will accept your assurance , but i 'm afraid i do n't see your point .
why has this happened to the world ? why is it winter now , and dark ?
aye . honeythorn gump 'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer .
i 'm going to put a guard on your door .
one officer already got killed trying to protect me . please , just take it all away . leave me alone .

frida , you 're not making sense . i ca n't come over right now .
it 's ten minutes past midnight . curfew begins at midnight .
please , we just want to take a short ride . a friend of mine has never seen the casbah .
then i 'd ask you what your terms are .
first , let 's get something straight . we ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime . if you want to kill yourself , mr. case , there 's much more entertaining ways than working for me .
foredecks . crew quarters , bridge , medical and science labs , hydroponics , what have you . that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area . can we move in closer ?
shit , doc , any closer and we 're gon na need a rubber ...
yeah , it 's getting late . i could sure use a bath .
that 's a real nice watch you got there , sir . fancy old thing even plays a little tune .
they must be shielded somehow . i 'm sure the base is there .
well , if it 's not , we 'll be facing that death star all by our lonesome .
yeah , that 'd bring you back to life .
you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys .
so ... what was i ... oh , yeah . do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable ? that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart .
first of all , its never out of the blue . and second of all --
well , whatever the hell you wanted to do , you are going to tell me everything right now . do you understand ? !
you know that ... letter you showed me in milan -- the one about hippolyte charles ?
it does n't seem to be in any hurry .
he was just laying all his things out on one of the beds ! coats , suits , shirts , sox , even his wife 's --
you were off your ass back there ! where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit ?
i took a ballroom class with michelle . i never danced with anyone but her , til tonight . that lorraine chick is good .
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv . thunder rumbles . theo takes sheila by the shoulders .
tell me , sheila . what are you afraid of ? sheila shakes her head .
let 's face it , what the fuck are you doing in las vegas ?
i 'm going to move to a smart hotel , tomorrow if it 'll make you feel better . let 's talk about tomorrow . wan na do something ?
it 's not my voice ... but i know her .
maybe the voice is n't diane selwyn . maybe that 's your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are .
no one knows . they say it blew up .
blew up ? what do you mean it blew up ?
when they find out what it 's carrying , they may not be so interested in what 's legal .
maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat .
this ca n't be happening . my career 's at a peak , i finally met a cute guy , i just bought a new house ...
just shut the fuck up and maybe you 'll live .
how many times i got to tell you . i saw a ship .
well , why have n't they answered our flares ?
taylor ! may i ask what *taylor* has to do with it ?
well , he 's still running the show , ai n't he , dad ?
you 've been under a lot of pressure lately -
uh-uh . listen , i 'll tell you what . you say i 'm wrong . and i say i 'm right . so why do n't we make a little bet on it ?
eve , if you 'll let me , i can --
look ! i 'm limping ! how attractive is that ? ! what if this is for life ? !
do n't bet on it . last time i had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker .
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies .
what is it -- i ca n't tell anything --
it 's some kind of organ -- it 's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat .
< i > that 's the point of the thing , not to know ! < /i >
< i > -- it 's a bat . -- will it bend ? -- it 's a rat . -- will it break ? -- perhaps it 's the head that i found in the lake. < /i >
i want to believe you . i really do .
you will believe me , because it 's true .
well , what about books ? you like hemingway ? you got ta love hemingway .
the sun also rises . for whom the bell tolls . the old man and the --
you know how in your big cities , you got your niggers and you got your puerto ricans ? well out here we got indians . that 's just the way it is .
the only good indian is a dead indian , does that old adage still hold true out here ?
c'mon , i would n't have a destiny without you . my destiny would be dying at from eating --
do n't bring that up . like a different girlfriend would'd 've let you die ?
milo ? gary boyd . i 'm hoping you and your friend can come up here . we 've made some amazing strides in digital convergence . i 'd love to show them to you .
you would ? wow . when would we come ? 'think he hung up .
then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies ?
i did not conduct at at the rally , i conducted on the evening before the rally .
yeah , wizard , i guess . i mean do what you think is right .
i 'm real sorry i had sex with you . i know it was n't your idea .
bill did n't say - but lloyd was beside himself . he listened to his play as if someone else had written it , he said , it sounded so fresh , so new , so full of meaning ...
how nice for lloyd . and how nice for eve . how nice for everybody .
drink to me , kringelein -- it 's my last chance .
i do drink , baron -- i drink to you , baron and to win . it 's good , -- come along , baron .
kind of tough , i guess ... but you 're not liable to hunt them -- i do n't think there 's any alive now , anyways -- and i 'm not sure but i do n't think there ever were ...
then if they was n't alive , how can they be an animal ? ...
i walked out the door . there 's no more memory .
come back and make up a good-bye at least . let 's pretend we had one .
we 're all part of the same hypocrisy , senator . but never think it applies to my family .
all right , then let me say you 'll pay me because it 's in your interests to pay me .
the survivors of flight died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash . that was death 's original design .
exact order ? then i 'm next ! i was meant to die with my friends , so i 'm next !
take a bow , steven , you 've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me .
if that 's the fact , price , okay , you 've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
just like i always promised . now you 're among the immortals . you 're movie stars .
here 's to ed . for making us into something .
this is crazy . we 're loosing our first strike capabilities !
we 're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we 're getting nowhere . atlantic command is working on a type of visual communication .
you have n't told me where we 're going .
have n't i ? to the airport , if you could .
no , no . i just did n't sleep well . i 'm not used to sleeping alone . and this heat . would you mind ?
no , of course not . i 'll just clean up .
i want to go upstairs . it 's cold and spidery down here . i 'm hungry .
now listen to me , pearl . you and me is runnin ' off tonight .
we have to send somebody over there immediately ! if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy . we 'll be off the hook . there 's a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily .
i 'll send cardoza , he 'll be able to ...
the point is you do n't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits . she got protein somewhere , she 's a very strong girl and i think she 'll live ... despite the delay in medical treatment .
that 's all i want to know . lets get out of here before i get the epizootics myself . thank you , doctor , for your discourse , it was fascinating , no doubt .
he only wants you to throw the stick for him , jabez . i guess he 's feeling the spring a-coming , too .
all right -- only he need n't dirty my pants !
that mail room kid was the longest lasting `` guest '' yet ! maybe we can alter the computer records and make another `` guest '' from the more athletic of our staff .
bruce may still refuse . it is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent .
no , no . easier , quicker , more seductive .
but how am i to know the good side from the dark ?
that was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally , yes . but --
great ! that 's fucking great ! they only asked you to sing because of your name ! you can stick it above the browser racks over there .
she usually is . trying one way or another to get money out of wynant . i wanted to find out if you were er - er - -- sleuthing for her .
i have n't been a detective for four years .
... but ai n't you got a little something for the infirm ?
i 'm a little short pops . i 'll catch you next time .
soup ? rice ? what are we doing , beginning all over again ?
no , we had a clear soup to start . this is a thick one and you ought to taste it . there 's nothing like it back home .
was it because we went to that party ? you know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into -- it 's no place for kids .
a minute ago you said you did n't care if he drinks .
you must n't hurt him . must n't - must n't hurt..
focus all your powers on me , rowan until it is done . only me ...
no , no , i do n't . i thank you , i really do . thank you , but i do n't need you anymore .
look , i can be selfish , i know that . i 'm not blind to my own failings ...
no , seriously . we used to shoot pool together in rangoon .
how do you do it , kahn ? how do you live so full of life for so long ?
that day in brooklyn was the last day i remember really having a great time .
well , we never have any laughs anymore , is the problem .
where the hell we going to get us a football team ?
all three of us played for our schools . and there are at least four other guys ...
press thought `` no , '' whaddaya think ... ?
< u > i < /u > think , here 's what i think : s'it gon na rain ... ?
do n't you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure .
wait a second , i thought we were hamburger guys .
thank you ... i 'm sorry you had to lie . it must have been difficult .
i asked the officers if you had committed some crime ... if they had said 'yes ' , you would be speaking with them right now .
sir te believes it 's a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu .
but something is going on at the yu household .
i 've been shot , and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt . but what you 're doing now , does . i do n't know why .
my dad was right ! he said you 'd ruin her life .
she 's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we 're never gon na make it . might i remind you this was your brainstorm .
i 'll drop off my fare , hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto .
this is the room above the art treasures room . the lock is a natalya z-z , first created ...
snickers , baby , i love you like a brother , but really , who cares ? silencer bomb ...
i 'm happy that you 're working again . as long as it comes naturally , that 's terrific . you 've always liked working with your hands , have n't you ?
yeah , since i was a kid . i had a woodwork class once when i was ... in school that time . then i learned a lot more when i was in the --
everyone handles it differently . some are ready , some are not .
do they get down on their knees , begging and crying ?
see the condoms in the grass over there . we killed tonight , veronica . we murdered our baby .
hey , it was good for me too , sparky .
oh . well , how do you spend your day ?
you mean when i 'm not working on a ...
stuck on her ! obviously , you do n't know me very well .
i do n't know you at all . bud permit me -- c.c . baxter -- junior executive , arthur murray graduate , lover .
i would n't know . i never imagined this . not in my whole life did i ever imagine this .
you do n't have to imagine it . not anymore . now all you 've got to think up is what it 's going to buy you .
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink . it 's very delicate . do people ever get drunk on this ?
there have been cases ... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast . to us , ninotchka !
i 'm glad you feel that way , because i feel that way , too .
but you do n't have hidden motives for feeling that way , right ?
well , if nothing else , it 's nice to know we can still be friends .
i do n't want to be your friend , brian .
do you think we could talk about the taping ? tomorrow 's taping , just so we can get it out of the way and order ...
yeah , well , questions will go toward what work you did there , why you were fired . and others will deal ...
oh my ! oh my ... maybe you better come out now , miss starling .
not yet ! - just wait for me . maybe in about two seconds .
hail the all-knowing bruce wayne . here 's what i know , she loves me , not you and it 's driving you crazy . it 's why you stopped us from kissing . because if you ca n't have her , nobody can .
she 's clouded your mind . you 're not thinking straight .
we 've been over this a dozen times . no .
why not ? just once . a trial run . what harm could it do ?
uh , no one , of course , is going to see these tapes , but ...
that 's right , and it 's more a problem for ehrlichman . he fixed hunt up with the phony cia id 's , but ... what else does hunt have on us ?
it 's okay really , i was just a baby .
i 'm sorry , it 's just ... i 've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and ... sometimes it gets out of hand .
we hope so , son . and no matter what your mother is , we 'll love her anyway .
suspect 's family is headed east on calverton ... .
why are you so nervous ? what is the matter with you today ?
i do n't know . reunions do funny things to people .
i 'm on the last page . how do you spell conscience ?
c-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. i got sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let 's go out .
well , you know so much why do n't you just fix it yourself ?
if i could do you think i 'd be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else ?
you 're talking like boris karloff ! it 's movie dialogue !
david , please believe me . you will kill people , david . you 've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins .
... this is amazing ... for me ... being here with you . i mean , in my dreams you ...
i do n't want to hear about your fucking dreams !
that 's because we do n't belong anywhere . you do n't fit into your world , and i do n't fit into mine . we 're the outcasts of the universe .
maybe . or maybe it 's the other people who do n't belong .
of course i 'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- i never took those pills -- i never loved you -- we never even met -- is n't that the way you want it ?
there you go again -- you know i did n't mean it that way , fran . just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- i mean baxter -- and i 'll see you as soon as i can . bye , fran .
deb ... it 's me . i need you to step out front .
out front ? you home , baby ? i got a surprise for you .
what does this have to do with my testimony ? ! i told the truth ! it 's valid and true and provable !
that 's not the fucking point , whether you told the truth or not ! hello ... ?
... you do n't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment .
i wonder if i hang around with you because you 're like my surrogate mother figure or something . like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly .
my mom drinks , too ... why do people drink , creasy ?
now that 's a question . i do n't know about your mom . for me , the problem is n't in the glass . the problem 's in between my ears .
morning , doc . awful early , are n't ya ?
could n't sleep , pumper . is everything , uh , all right tonight ?
yikes ! no . paul was n't into that . he followed a balanced diet and-
yeah , i know , and was into that whole yale thing .
you know libbets , i really feel , you know , like a real connection to you --
yeah but you do n't even know me really .
fine nothing ! i did n't want war ... my plan was to marry mrs. teasdale and overthrow firefly .
maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
what 'emotion ' ? girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick .
she 's scared ! fear is an emotion ! look , kid , if you remember anything from your time working with harry zimm , let it be the three key words to filmmaking .
so what you doin ' with a cat like me in a joint like this ?
you do n't think much of yourself , do you ?
mama ! mama ! miss boatwright , say she gon ' help me find where daddy is !
good ! but you do n't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it ! you 'll get that woman in trouble !
man , all you got ta do is find a girl who looks just like her , nail her , and then dump her man , get her off your mind .
your only mistake is that you did n't dump her first . diane court is a showpony . you need a stallion , my friend . walk with us and you walk tall .
remember when we sat on that mob guy , that chef , for like six months ?
oh , man , i 've never eaten so good in my life . why do n't you develop a useful skill ?
that 's impossible . you 're the only one who could have it .
i 'm sorry it 's impossible . it 's the truth .
now wait a minute ! this business about spock and mccoy ... honestly , i have never understood vulcan mysticism -- i 'm sorry ! but part of me does n't want you to make a fool of yourself ... understand ?
harry , you do n't have to believe ! i 'm not even sure i believe . but if there 's even a chance that spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility .
depths of hell ... ohio . how 'bout you ?
kennet square , pa. 'mushroom capital of the world ' .
i still ask , why do they want disarmament ?
well , for the same reasons we do , sir . do n't you see ?
you know the old man upstairs in this house . old irishman , always drunk . he got pleurisy . he was inna hospital two weeks . he died yesterday .
well , i always like to visit you , catherine , because you always got such cheerful news .
i 'm sorry , sir , i 'm engaged to be married . my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man .
did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire ?
i just want to know what your game is , mister , that 's all .
how the hell did you get into the building ?
no , no , no . no exploitation . this is serious but do n't you find it a little funny too , at the same time ?
you 've got a family tragedy on your hands . will you tell me what 's funny about that ? about a kid in a coma ?
-- no . the basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing : big long iron levers just lying there --
-- not a chance -- there 's too much weirdness down there i do n't think even bullets are gon na stop .
perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and i see the questions first . then i decide if i grant the interview .
no . we do n't do that . you 've seen `` minutes '' and mike wallace . so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity . you also know we are the highest-rated , most-respected , tv-magazine news show in america .
not really but i 'm probably not a toffee maker . how would you do those lines of mine ?
well , look at it this way , i mean , when you come right down to it , that girl , she 's a bit of a scrubber , is n't she ?
oh , yeah . i 'm just curious about that kind of stuff .
so it looks like we 're going to be spending the weekend together .
dorothy might love me or not , as she likes , but best will have to fight me before he marries her !
faith , i think you are a lad that 's likely to keep your word .
danny , what the hell are you trying to do out there ?
what do you mean ? i 'm just doing what we 've always done .
i was getting hot dogs . what do you mean ?
i mean it strikes me funny that every time superman comes around , you disappear .
... des petites fraises des bois ... de la crčme de bretagne ...
... so it blows up that big ... what they call an omelette surprise !
what the hell is that , some kind of porno store or something ?
not exactly . it 's some lingerie store on the strip .
the question is , what happened to freddy 's body ?
they burned him to death in his boiler room , but they were smart enough to hide the remains .
okay , i do n't want to play this game anymore .
it 's an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they 've done something wrong ... or the level of what they 've done wrong .
i 'll bring the wine ... and the business plan . and lydia you 'll bring the ghosts .
i ca n't < u > bring < /u > the ghosts . they 're not here !
we do n't know what else to do . we need results .
you 'll get results one way or the other , that 's for sure ... okay .
why did you do that , brother ? i 've never done wrong to you .
you want to know why i did that , well you see - i do that ... he stamps on alex 's foot .
sofie . it 's so obvious ... you 're after my daughter .
well , i got ta say , mrs. cook , you 're right about that .
do n't say that . there is no such thing as a blacklist . now , are you gon na play ball ?
yes . leo , goddammit ... this is n't fair !
do n't judge a comic book by it 's cover .
you agree with a lot of what he says , do n't you .
hello , mr. gayle . i 'm phil wurlitzer . we talked on the phone . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
same here . let me introduce my crew . scott ... roger ... and unruly julie ... this is ... i 'm sorry . what 's your title again ?
i ai n't escaping ! we 're picking up the new super just like i told you .
then you 're lucky i came along . does n't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this . now help me out of this trunk .
maybe i oughta talk to this ray bones character myself . see if he wants to invest in my movie .
do n't waste your time , harry . the guy 's not much of a movie fan . now c'mon , gim me the key .
you probably also know that we found them okay .
yes , i know that . but i can assure you that they were about to fail .
that 's easy for you to say - you 're already dead .
no , david . harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead . the undead .
no , i was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly .
then suppose you give me the money . four hundred and fifty dollars .
is that a gift from wendel ? it has an aeronautical feel to it .
yes . from wendel . to celebrate , the license approval for our air-charter firm . i forgot to tell you .
herb , it 's too much . it 's all out of hand .
do you know what kind of opportunity you have here ? you got ta < u > strike < /u > . i 'm talking mansions . lamborghinis . champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth !
let us pass , please ! let us pass at once ! we 're with the emperor .
i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted .
listen , johnnie , lula just called me . she knew you were in n.o. , so they left the city .
did she tell you where she was callin ' from ?
if i 'm lucky . so ... i wo n't be back until the first . your dad will be back on sunday , so i 've put elizabeth in charge until then . she has the car ... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow .
how does it feel to have a wacko for a son ?
how many kids get a chance to live on another planet .
no more kids yelling , 'your old man 's a thieving rapist ' ?
sugar , dear - let me give you some advice . if i were a girl - and i am - i 'd watch my step .
if i 'd been watching my step , i never would have met him . wait till i tell josephine .
so what was the first day after heather 's suicide like ?
i do n't know , it was okay , i guess .
betty sizemore . what do you mean you wrote it ?
i 'm lyla branch . i 'm the producer .
well , the widow curtis will bring you riches , position , land , even half-grown children . you wo n't have to do anything at all ! you sha n't have to do another thing to prove yourself .
you know very well who it is that i love .
sorry about your wallet , but if you think i 'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars , a maxed out visa and a bad fake i.d. , you 're fucking crazy . jake .
take a deep breath and count to ten . it 's not that kind of work . you 're lily , right ?
i will of course do my best to hang onto it .
where is it ? he . the boy you said my brother bought ! where is he ?
ca n't we ever have a discussion without that coming up ?
it 's important to me , dante . you have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit . i wish you 'd go back to school .
you know , buddy , sometimes i ca n't figure you out at all . you can be very nice , but like your mother said there 's an evil streak in you .
there 's an evil streak in everybody , rose .
i 'm a little short pops . i 'll catch you next time .
your lies are old , but you tell 'em well .
now turn around . i 'm going to cuff you .
put those away . we ca n't have marks on his wrists .
what could they do ? the guy that took the head was about six-seven , and maybe three-hundred pounds . he was packing two lugers , and the others had m-16s .
they just ran back out into death valley -- you know , where manson turned up ...
you were trying to break down the door . do you know why ?
when i saw you were gone i got scared .
it all starts with them going to the bathroom together .
that many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that .
just place an x in the appropriate place on the lifeline .
i just do n't get this . everything ca n't be lumped into two categories . that 's too simple .
you are not dead , boy . accept it .
this is monstrous . i 'll burn in hell for all eternity .
christ , ca n't you read between the lines ! he did everything he could to save him ... if he gave himself up they 'd both be dead !
maybe . and maybe they 'd at least be talking to us ! now tell your 'partner ' to stay out of it , or so help me if he lives through this i 'll put him behind bars myself !
'we will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door . '
i 'm telling you , animal , these nazis ai n't kosher .
you 've read about my father in the papers . you 've seen that no one 's here to guard him . now i 've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him . believe me and help me .
we do n't have to disconnect them , we can wheel the stand with the bed .
sure , you 're working on the passports ... ... and visas ?
they will be ready . you guys do your job .
no -- mama does n't dream about you any more , walter . you would n't know the old girl now .
oh , yes i would . i 'd know you any time --
i sure ai n't his fairy godmother ... now i 'm looking for ganz ... where is he ?
have n't seen him for years . that 's the truth .
let them talk , mr president . let them talk .
sirs : our theories have a bearing on his identity .
hardly anybody does , that 's the beauty part . no cameras , the doj does n't bother with it , it 's accessed by a tunnel they boast about . you know the best place to hide a leaf ?
yeah , that 's old , in a tree .
i just figured you was out bein ' mr. cool ...
not exactly , sugar ... one reason we 're in all the trouble we 're in right now is cause of what i was doin ' ... i tried to tell you this before ...
i was n't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless -- i expect i 'll find some ways to be of use .
in other parts of the world , i suppose there are other ways .
it ai n't been a good day , chief .
give up , dennis . let these people go . at least you 'll have your life .
are you totally gone ? this is my private home ...
i am trying to keep emotions out of this . even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject .
you know as well as i do that it was made to look like he was lynched . now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree ?
what difference does it make if it 's persimmon , oak tree or huckleberry bush ?
well , no . but he had to escape the nazis .
but i thought he came over to america before the war .
how very thoughtful ... or did crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you 're both booted off the case ?
nobody sent me . i came on my own .
sorry i did n't let you know where i was .
do n't be . would n't be on vacation if you did .
you ? what about me ? im working hard for you here , jack . on christmas too ! now you did a good thing last night , intervening that way . i was moved ...
please . just tell me whats happening to me . in plain english . none of that mumbo jumbo ...
if my dad 'd leveled with me like that even once ... the weird thing is , my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary ? it 's his fantasy , too .
i think that 's great , milo . i do .
shut up , will you ? i wonder how much sam the bookie will give up for our overcoats ?
sam the bookie ? nothing doing ! you 're not putting my overcoat on that dog !
oh , he 's just like any other man , only more so .
no , i mean , is he trustworthy ? is his word --
the next time will be as this time- the devil has come to tsavo-
-that 's ridiculous talk and you ca n't seriously believe it-
`` what we want is in that room . ''
they 're coming in here , are n't they ?
you wo n't miss a thing about being single ... the wild parties , the different girls every night , running around like a maniac ... god , i miss that .
stan , you 're depressing me ... hey , i did n't know you were going to fill 'er up . just take a couple of gallons , okay ?
dewey , you and i would never make it .
maybe not . but think about the sex . as frustrated as i am ...
he 's in trouble , all right . but i do n't have any idea what it is .
do you want something to drink ? a beer ? a glass of water ?
they seemed sure it was either alice or lois .
which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place . did you want to see cathy about something ?
not really , frank . i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure .
all right , hal . we 'll take care of it . let me have the hard copy , please .
not the only man to meet his jezebel either .
so he got a reduced and come over here . nam 's his freedom man , nam 's his pussy . three years he been here .
good , i 'm looking forward to meeting this spanky . give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess .
i ca n't wait to see that . you slay me , man .
he has ? .. what 's he doing here ?
he was waiting for you , sir . wait- ed a good while . said he 'd go down and take a look . i hope that 's o.k .
want to come in for awhile ? log onto aol , flirt with some married men , head into a private s & m chat room . . .
how do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you .
yep . afraid you have me at a disadvantage .
kenai at the general store asked me to bring these . did n't expect we 'd already met .
i 've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years .
check ncic , maybe he 's got a record . then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location .
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling .
well , it 's tempting , but no thanks .
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them .
then why do n't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while ?
your mother 's in here with us karras , would you like to leave a message ? i 'll see that she gets it .
if that 's true , then you must know my mother 's maiden name . what is it ?
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to vegas .
they organized this , not me . i have nothing to do with it .
< i > jack said we should work together. < /i >
< i > three of a kind ... < /i >
that 's why he has the parties , he says it 's like bringing the world to me .
why do n't you come down to la ? stay with us for a while .
then call him . i 'm sure it was an oversight .
no . it 's his way . he hates me . him and teddy . they always hated me .
annie , in , women often died in childbirth , but her spirit is the important thing , and misery 's spirit is still alive --
i do n't want her spirit ! i want her ! and you murdered her !
sure . romance , that 's great ! to engineer your comeback , we 're gon na need a whole slate of pictures . once `` glen or glenda '' takes off , we 'll slam you into one , then another , then another !
that 's good . i could use the money .
that is why he must go to hell . i do not think it fair . but god 's law is not for us to judge .
you 're telling me mr. whale is a homo .
sometimes i wonder if the guys we 're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with , you know ?
all i know is -- i 'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like joey .
alan ? where are we going ? you see something ?
uh - - anybody else think we should n't be out here ?
i 'll make it up to you this summer . i promise .
i 'm your daughter all the time , you know . not just when it 's convenient .
can you say what camp they gon ' send you to , daddy ?
i do n't know , son -- they wo n't tell us things like that -- but i do n't want y'all to come here no more .
the handle is heavy . and the blade is no ordinary metal . still , the sword is the lightest of weapons . you 're just not used to handling it .
but i have had much practice . as a child in the west , a platoon lived with us . they 'd let me play with their weapons . the scabbard is so beautiful .
i turn it on when i confront the guy .
yeah , but you have n't found him yet . the guy took off for las vegas .
the man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room , in my presence . he is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal , regardless of what he did for my children .
he knew the consequences . and he stayed . are those the actions of a criminal ? ... duncan , do something .
perhaps -- in time -- you 'll earn them back through good behavior --

hey , wait a minute ! that 's all our food supplies in there ! we ca n't pump poison gas all over them !
once we kill the thing we wo n't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep . also , it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies ; it may be fouling them all .
... that 's what the sister said . the chart said she ate nine hours prior to ...

sure he did . and he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa .
oh , i do n't want to put you to any inconvenience .
oh , it 's not the slightest inconvenience , general bonaparte . it is an honor to have you here .

you should never have gone out in such foul weather .
someone has to look after you . it could 've been someone . it was before .
your nose ring comes out of your nose . if you 've got them in your nipples , they come out , too . and there 's no make-up at my house . no glue sniffing . huffing . no pills , no grass .
if you hit me , i 'll call the police .
boy , i ca n't even remember the last time he was in a picture .
it 's a shame . he 's such a rest actor , and nobody uses him anymore .
on the gas station owner , who has retreated to his counter and produces a shotgun , and starts to load it .

wait a minute . you want to go with me ? you can meet my mama .
i do n't want to worry your mama with company .
i 'm sorry ? your face looks awfully familiar , i just ca n't quite place it ...
mom , this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway . the guy you yelled at for no good reason ...
`` minimal '' is too much . it has to be light , it has to be strong --
light and strong , light and strong , sure , why not , it 's only impossible . god save me from academics .
i 'm not sure where it is . not exactly . i never saw it . i just heard him talk about it .
oh , that 's great . we killed jake because you heard him talk about some money that you 've never seen . that 's fucking brilliant !

laura , are n't you going to fix me a drink ?
i distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list . what are you doing here ?
dear margo . you were an unforgettable peter pan - you must play it again , soon . you remember miss caswell ?

... so you saved hanukkah mr. big shot . i mean , let 's be honest mordechai , it is n't even one of the high holidays .
i do n't know , sir . but they 're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are . war just does n't make sense any more , for anybody .
but war does n't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right ?
i do n't know . could n't get the right price , i suppose .
and you do n't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing ?
sell it to him . you get a couple bucks , it pays for the ride . i got a job , nice apartment . i do okay .
they interview you or anything ? at the plane crash ?
basketballs , frank . you had us playing for basketballs .
i 'm sorry . i should 've checked it out . i screwed up . but that does n't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig .
mr. hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager . the men liked him . i 'm really gon na have to scramble to fill his shoes .

well , of course , if you put it that way .
and remember this , bruce ! i love her , too .
i used you as a diversion . while you were getting captured upstairs , i was shredding documents in the basement . deep down , i guess i was just jealous . you were one incredible thief ...
to what do i owe the dishonor of a reunion , you centrally intelligent scumsicle .
good day , monsieur . do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell ?
my regrets , my dear major , but i believe you have been blocking the road .
what are you talking about ? you were never an alky , you were a cokehead .
yeah , well when you quit blow , you got ta quit the booze , too .
you 're a good pilot ... i 've learned a lot from you ... i wish you ...
i know , but the chances for survival here just are n't great enough in my book . i 've got what i came for . now i 've got to get back to my ship .
look , dillinger , lee donowitz is not a pimp -
i know that richard . i do n't think i 'll need it . but something this last week has taught me , it 's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it .
my children are not going with you , and that 's that .
that 's not fuckin ' that ... this is fuckin ' this . go sit over there .
you 've been through quite an ordeal , mrs. haydn . why do n't you stay where you are and let us pick you up ? we 'll fly you home .
no . you 'll want to ask a lot of questions i do n't want to answer right now . i already have a ride .
you should grow a moustache . you 're a real man now .
i ca n't grow a moustache . it never comes in evenly .
i -- i did n't really pay much attention -- bobby has such an active imagination .
did you believe what he told you ? i have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason .
look , i do n't know what you want --
i thought it was important for you to know the facts .
no , you wait right there for me ... i 'll be on the piedmont flight tomorrow at seven . meet me at the airport .
i 'll meet you , marietta , if that 's what you want , but i 'm against it .
gettin ' kind of tense , are n't you ?
oh , uh , mr. lightyear ? now i 'm curious . what does a space ranger actually do ?
is n't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge ?
i 've seen bodies before . this is different .
dad , i 'm so sorry . i know this is a bad time .
you 've always called before , always . now i 'm not asking what you did , i just want to know that you 're alright .
your honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons mr. marsh died . how it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance .
are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing ?
i guess i have . you were pretty little when they locked him up . i do n't suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months .
sure i remember . you went to mexico lookin ' for cattle .
i did n't know barry had a beach house .
neither did i until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog 's name .
thanks . look , i 'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good .
nothing you could do would make it any worse .
but i was baptized . and i certainly was n't born of incest .
you were not baptized . at least i do n't believe it was christian . your baptism was performed by your uncle , james mckenzie .
any poop on the john doe you found out there today ?
nothin ' much . the rangers put ben wetzel on it . catch you later .
it was kind of like clicking , maybe a language was n't it ?
listen to this . a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning . when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish ' ...
i ca n't ... i ca n't find a shelter
you reek . you reek of ... shit . do you know that ? goddammit , al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot . al ... i 'm sorry .
the boys at school do n't think i am .

i do n't know . i 'm not exactly the nine-to-five type .
our baby 's going to nationals ! lincoln , alabama -- look out !
i 'm gon na be on tv ! just like diane sawyer .
oh it 's good , & quot ; in lieu of & quot ; i love that word lieu .
i prefer it to & quot ; instead & quot ; , it has more dignity .
not a class , not a thing , just picked stuff up by myself .
i wish i had your natural talent . god only makes that visit once in a while .
dad , the man has been lying to us for a hundred years . i mean , where is my forty acres and a mule ?
you would n't know a mule if it bit you in the ass . and personally , i do n't need a mule . i got a lexus . and nobody gave it to me --
would n't be a favor if you were paying me . i 'll just take my five when the deal is done .
you 're a good man . jimmy the finn .
bates ' motel . he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it ... go on , sam .
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates ...
they know they failed to kill benes . security thinks they 'll try again , first chance they get . we 're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination .
surgical assassination ? ! but that means you suspect --
i 'm telling you it 's a forgery . the paint 's still wet for god 's sake .
look on the back . what do you see ?
did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle sin is this : my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
ca n't help it . you 're doing time for me . no greater love , as the man says . wish you 'd tell me why .
as the man said , it 's in my nature .
okay . is there any way to duplicate that feeling ? some memory or ...
i 'm sure i can come up with something .
once you 're in it , it warms up .
fuck you ! < u > you < /u > come out here . hey , toss me that j.d .
contrary to what dr. long may have told you , this is neither ...
... your concern nor your fight . relinquish the package and you can go .
blood has been shed . we 've incurred risks , jerry . i 'm coming into town tomorrow . have the money ready .
now we had a deal here ! a deal 's a deal !
i do n't know ... please ... tell me i 'm dead ...
who are you to decide if you should live or die ?
no , i 'm not . i 'm just really busy .
i know . i know its not by choice . i just mean , well , being the kind of person you are , it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to .
impressive -- is it not ? the problem is i can only keep the illusion for a few minutes . i need more power to hold the form longer . i need the highlander . where is he ?
i do not know -- and even if i did ...
i ... ? i saw it . i was there .
you were there . at ... at 10:35 ... ?
beats me how she could get that pony out o ' camp without neither of us hearin ' a thing ...
she ai n't goin ' back to her family , that 's certain ... not if she took off where the arrow points .
would you like to take a turn around the deck with me ?
yes -- is it all right if i come like this ?
i do n't think you will . it 's your father 's .
i do n't believe it ! you 're lying !
i must have dozed off . my sincerest apologies , sir .
no apology necessary . that 's the first time in thirty years .
i got the woman covered . where you thinkin ' about doin ' this ?
i was thinkin ' the del amo mall . in the food court .
who knows with these `` deficients '' ? his profile indicates a proclivity for violence .
i 'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections --
what 's gon na happen when he sees me drivin ' the car tomorrow ?
maybe he 'll get a little nervous , but who gives a shit ?
aye . and it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here . i entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow , most lovely of the lovely .
dear lad , what does winter bespeak but death ? it is a time of mourning . this calamity is a curse . something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world .
you back this mission , and i 'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
the number 's seventy-five . and it 's applications and patents .
you volunteered , did n't you ? are n't we paying you for this ?
yeah , but i did n't know you were going to give me electric shocks . what are you trying to prove ?
mrs. clark , why are you doing this to me ? why 're you pretendin ' you do n't know what 's goin ' on ?
amber , i 'm sorry . i really am . but you know the rules . all talent costumes hafta be okay 'd by gladys before the pageant .
well it 's nice that you were there for her .
i took pity on the poor woman . this house is too big for one person to live alone in ...
we 've got her sister . testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital . this is the point .
you got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance .
so it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding . that means wintermute hired us to fry itself . it does n't make sense .
could be suicidal . it 's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs .
whatever . famous . to where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else .
ummm ... four years . six to get rich .
we did n't see anything - - did we ?
no - nothing . besides , it 's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
yes , i did . it 's terrifying ! the police were at my house this morning .
who on earth would want to harass poor dottie hinkle ?
but ive done some good things too , havent i ?
youve been jack campbell . and thats always a good thing ...

two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the london hotels . he didnt need your confession ...
youre sure he said his caller was a man ?
the corner of hawthorne and granvia . tumbler messed up . he said the lotus would be at the corner of hawthorne and granvia --
he did n't mess up . there it is ...
wait a second . you 're steven reign ? you 're big time . you own all them big hotels . what are you doing in hong kong ?
i 'm just in town for the weekend , taking in the sights .
not necessarily . she 'd probably want to help .
what 's the good of another post mortem ? suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to harry ?
and what is that worth , the promise of a woman ? you 're very funny , highness .
i was giving you a chance . no matter where you take me ... there 's no greater hunter than prince humperdinck . he could track a falcon on a cloudy day . he can find you
got it ! let 's move out girls . yllo go to lab two and cover out backs .
at least try to get him alive ... will ya brodski ?
me neither , but the upshot is i 've got color live-action footage of you and ms hawkins and it does n't look good .
so ... how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life ?
i 'm all checked out for light surf and look at it .
do me this favor just once . use the ponds .
he ca n't fire me . lariviere already did that this morning .
he 's a selectman . the town . he said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office . i 'm supposed to pull the cb and police light out of your car . they 're town property .
that 's marvelous ... . you must have worked day and night ... . do n't you ever sleep ?
i need very little sleep . we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange . i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs .
i 'm a dead man ! from here on , believe me , i 'm a dead man .
what are you talking about , dave ? you were n't mentioned in the story . do n't jump to conclusions .
when it falls off the table and turns turtle -- cute ?
mary -- fall off the boat and turn to the left --
i understand . that 's why i picked up the phone .
then why ca n't you -- fuck , never mind , just call donny then , and ask him to --
i 've been very lazy for a long , long time .
you seem like you 're anything but lazy , uncle billy .
violin . i never had the lungs for wind instruments .
could'a fooled me , the way you were hollering into that cell phone .
i do n't know if it has , really . with the exception of one and three , i 've pretty much kept out of it . i 'm working in television now . the hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy .
now that you have a child , is it possible you 've decided horror is bad for children ?
they 're dead in the water that morning . four hours later the captain 's relieved of his command . and that evening they issue a general sos .
possibly false . hence the ima record of being lost at sea . i do n't think mutiny 's out of the question here .
twenty-four is n't young . i 'd already been goin ' out with him ten years when we got married . i 've never been with anybody but darryl .
well , if you do n't mind me sayin ' so , he sounds like a real asshole .
he was here , earlier tonight , and he may be coming back . i 'm going to wait for him .
i keep thinking i should call the radio and tv stations ...
i thought you wanted to buy spectacles an ' fancy clothes an ' all .
i 'd rather be blind and ragged than dead , i guess .
forget the stars . look here , at the earth , our mother , our womb . she deserves our loyalty and protection . and yet you spoil her lands , poison her oceans , blacken her skies . you 're killing her .
your intentions are noble , but no diesel fuel for heat . no coolants to preserve food . millions would die of cold and hunger alone .
good . they 're all heatseekers ! all of them , everybody . you keep one superstar and they 'll all follow . there 's no real loyalty , and the first person who told me that , jerry maguire , was you .
i think i was trying to sleep with you at the time .
then , what 's gone wrong ? why did it happen ?
if ye want more tricks , i 'm your man , but for big questions ye must go elsewhere .
arrest that man ! he 's committed to our care .
i never signed the contract . he 's not going anywhere .
it 's a three-act story with a tragic end .
your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . is n't she ?
i know , ma'am ... on'y it 's for a ole lady , no teeth , got ta sof'n it with water so she can chew it , an ' she 's hongry .
why n't you buy a san'wich ? we got nice san'widges .
he 's so fuckin ' lucky . i could have buried him . i could have gone to europe and taken the baby . and then he'd 've tracked me down and he'd 've killed me .
no , he would n't . i would have . and he'd 've been right , too . i mean , seriously . well , there 's one thing you do n't do . you do n't take a guy 's kid and then take off .
i can turn on all the faucets in my house . even the hose .
but we do n't drink from the house do we .
hey , lem me close out the thing in style .
i 've come to feel it 's my thing . you know , you take a job ... you take a job , and , many times , it 's < u > just < /u > a job . and then ...
one more trick like this , and i 'll be forced to revoke all your liberties !
it 's that doctor fellow , is n't it ? he 's come to usurp your place here , has n't he ?
so could half the women in here . and i 'd rather go out with a nice can ... so watcha here for ? to say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me ...
i do n't hate you . i need your help .
okay ! okay , fuck it ! use the basement ! get off me !
we need some towels , lou . we need replacement light bulbs .
robbing this place is gon na put you back in prison .
not if they do n't catch us , kevin .
h'mm ... no wonder i have trouble rounding up this show -- do n't you know there 's a rehearsal going on ? -- and you wanted a raise. -- come on -- get going or you 'll get it !
oh , all right -- see you later , toots .
you would n't be going in with the troops . i can guarantee your safety .
these colonial marines are some tough hombres , and they 're packing state-of-the-art firepower . nothing they ca n't handle ... right , lieutenant ?
oh , yes , jeffrey . come in . he 'll be back any minute now . you 're welcome to wait . is it urgent ?
i just wanted to ask him a few questions , that 's all . maybe i better go .
desperation has driven me past etiquette , all the way to frenzy .
my schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics .
eh , he 's a nice old man , is n't he ?
oh yeah , he 's very clean , y'know .
why is it you never talk to me about scotland -- your life there .
because it 's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there .
< i > you drove lateesha 's daughter to school ... then dropped her off at the dmv . why ? < /i >
< i > her car was in the shop. < /i >
hi . how 's the branch manager from kansas city ?
i beg your pardon ? miss olsen i 'm miss olsen -- mr. sheldrake 's secretary .
oh , you could n't be more wrong , sweetheart . i can ' tell you how much i appreciate it and how i 'm looking forward to it .
good . songs . what songs should sidney -- pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play ?
i 'll tell you all in due time , after we make love . but first , tell me another poem .
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem : 'press the button , pull the chain , out comes a chocolate choo-choo train . '
you do n't know all that has happened here- the devil has come to tsavo .
you 're right . the devil has come . look at me . i am the devil .
i 'm sorry , mom . i 'll call grandma back and apologize .
that 's a good girl ... i hate to see you so upset . tell me , sweetheart . are you having problems with charlie ? you mentioned something this morning .
this is a sweet side of you . picking these up for ... `` mrs. haniver '' and ... `` mrs . raines . '' where are they ?
tragically , they 're dead . i 'm alive and i 'm in poverty . you want any ?
well if you could tell me roughly it would help .
okay , okay , we have a nine percent chance of getting back together . does that clarify the situation ?
your father does n't like me , does he ?
it 's not you . he dislikes that you 're a wallace . he just says ... the wallaces do n't seem to live for very long .
if he continues having these outbursts , i 'll have to have him isolated permanently .
do n't worry , it wo n't come to that .
you idiot ! you do n't even know what you 're fighting over !
my honor , that 's what i 'm fighting over . now get up off the ground , or do i have to whoop you where you lie ?
but marylin , you know a divorce would ruin me right now . everything i have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business . the business is my entire life .
are you forgetting about the atcheson , topeka and the santa fe ?
it 's okay . it was a long time ago .
i 've been thinking about getting tattoo . you know , a flower or something . on my ass .
you know what we do to welchers , cluett , do n't you ?
i know , i know , dude . oh , i must have been crazy ! i lost my head completely !
i wo n't deny i was ambitious . when i had my ... experience ... i wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible . i 'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises . you did n't answer my question .
i thought it was well-written . heart-felt . and a little bit naive ... but that 's just the enemy 's perspective .
just south to baltimore , maryland . so i know what you 're going to ask next . that you might ask -- i 'm not certain .
there 's ... there 's no need to bring anything dressy ... or ... i mean -- i did n't know if we 'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes .
all right , look . i can make it right , i can make this up to you , mattie . i can , i swear .
will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she 's nothing to you ? right out loud so i can hear ? tell her she 's nothing , tell her she 's nobody , just dirt ? will you do that ?
you will be a jehovah 's witness . i have a few `` awake '' magazines for you . you do n't have to keep her very long . a few seconds is all i 'll need . whatiya think ?
i do n't know . it sounds like a good daydream , . but actually doing it is too weird . too dangerous .

we ? you and your parents killed your husband ?
heidi , for christ sake , shut up ! will you shut your fucking mouth and listen ? !

`` mumford '' ... i mean , why pick the name of the town you were going to ?

you did n't call the sandwich joint with a urgent message ?
hell naw , willie . them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo ' brain !
i wish they 'd tell us what they 're going to do with us .
i heard stories . i do n't think you wan na know .
those are n't real memories . no one has that kind of recall .

martha , you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law .
no ... no , excuse me eve . as quickly as i see fit .
watching the bitch trash my car does n't count as a date .
i got her under control . she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image .
it 's the truth . if you 'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened .
somehow this winds up being my fault ? you always blame me .
new life defeats death ? follow the signs ? where the hell did you find that guy ?
yeah , i thought he was supposed to be helpful .
i 'm teaching my son to be a man .
so he can kill you . you hate your own life that much . you beg for a hero to kill you .
... the night batman was born . what was i doing in the fields that night , alfred ? what sent me running out into that storm ? i keep dreaming about it but i just ca n't remember .

just a few ... just a day or two ... the weekend .
i think we 'll have to shave the hair . deke , have you got a razor ?
it 's utilitarian , i 'll say that for it .
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store . you see , i had n't planned on spending much time here .
why should i feel such pain ? should be the other way round ... i could vex you ... make you dance your life away ...
threats wo n't make me love you . tis not the way of the human heart .
what were you doing there ? you never told me you were singing with an r and b group .
hey . i guess there 's a lot of things we do n't know about each other .
there should be a new word for happiness . being here with miss channing has been - i just ca n't say , she 's been so wonderful , done so much for me-
lloyd says margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality ... ... next to that sable , my new mink seems like an old bedjacket ... ... you 've done your share , eve . you 've worked wonders with margo ...
i take it you dont know where he is , then ?
huh ! you could always try suicide bridge . you dont know leon , do you ?
hey , we can leave together ca n't we ?

rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however , it does n't affect what we are talking about . please go on .
the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure , if he decided to make peace with the emperor , at least at this time .
then you can have the disks and i 'll just walk out that door --
if you walk out that door , bain will still come after you .
ames here . < u > yessir < /u > ...
okay . okay . the < u > suitcase < /u > bomb ...
and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you ?
i guess i would 've felt sorry for the universe .
it 's my life . if i want to fuck it up , that 's my business .
i said pretty much the same thing to my mother when i was your age .
very interesting , my dear , but could n't you write all that from moscow ? a dissertation on love on soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox .
it is not enough to be witty , madame . people grow tired of being entertained . you made that mistake before . problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony .
well , i asked the newsboy on the corner . he did n't know . then i asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . he was very helpful .
in other words , the whole goddamn world knows you 're here ! out ! get out !
cause i 'm not getting any better . it 's a waste of time .
you 've only been playing for two weeks , bob . it takes a long time to learn this game .
that young school teacher ... i heard the british hung him as a spy .
but it 's what he said , just before they killed him : `` i regret that i have but one life to give to my country . ''
one kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face . their secret identities would be revealed . but how best to bait a brid ?
the way to a boy 's heart is through his ego . what strapping young hero could resist his very own ... signal ?
wow , what a spread -- you know , there 's a food shortage in the rest of the colony .
yes , and do you know < u > why < /u > there 's a food shortage ?
no . face it now . stop thinking it 's good guys against bad guys .
how can you say that ? especially after today ?
i have a different story for every woman who asks . i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me .
and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries ?
sir te ! it has brought him as much trouble as glory . help him to leave these troubles behind . otherwise , he 'll never be able to start anew .
all right . i 'll act as the sword 's custodian .
bullshit . who is it ? you met someone .
no . i just need some space , maybe .
... figured i 'd better leave before i used it on him . i do n't know how you can stand him .
well , i 'm only an employee , i ai n't married to him .
it 's six o'clock . time 's runaing out . decide .
if i tell you , how do i know you wo n't just club me and take it back ?
you mean god said , `` i need you , jeanne ? ''
no , but ... he sent me so many signs !
no one 'll ever come here . shut it down . do n't worry , the bank 'll buy it back . i 'll take care of it .
you 'll take care of it ? not this time . no way . i bought it fair and square . and we open tonight .
i do n't know what it is , but it 's not a shark .
look -- you may be a big yahoo in the lab , but out here you 're just supercargo , and you 'll do as i say , or you can take your gear and backstroke home . now get down here !
oh cards , maybe . poker ... it 's getting cold , sal . i 'm going to take you in . we 'll call angela . the guys can help her bring you home ... did i tell you i was going on a trip ?
trip ? what do you mean , nick ? you said you 'd be --
you ca n't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night .
i think the doctor is a genius ! do n't you , igor ?
i think the doctor is a genius ! do n't you , igor ?
why certainly . do n't you , frau blucher ?
unbelievable ... ... and lily named her dog after him ? far out .
what kind of person do you have to be to do this ?
yep . you know , my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle . everything . until recently i wasn 't sure what he meant by that .
yeah ? no kidding . listen , you still want to go girl hunting tonight ?
that would be good . but i mean more like . i do n't know . like when i was having sex with her , i kept thinking how much i would like to put it in her ass . just to see what would happen .
she 's probably smash you in the fucking face .
i don ' need a hospital ... i feel fine .
too fine , badalato . the bad news is , you 're gon na live .
well , rick , you 're not only a sentimentalist , but you 've become a patriot .
maybe , but it seemed like a good time to start .
not to mention andrew zhdanov ... otis , come ! !
andre zhdanov ? how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov ?
what a nice -- and kind girl -- who is she -- ?
the new girl -- jabez says ; she is from over the mountain .
none of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you .
i care only about michelle . should i ask her when we first arrive ? or ... or when we 're leaving ? i could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace . i get so confused ...
you 'd done better to have told me that in the beginning . where were you the afternoon she was knocked off ?
you do n't think i had anything to do with it ?
this is an okay setup you got here , but i 'd say you ai n't just exactly , uh , flush , is that right or not ?
i been sick . hold this , will ya ?
george . oh , jesus christ , george . look at you .
shhh , honey , never mind . it 's alright . it 's over . i quit the business . i 'm out .
i 'm sorry , sailor . i just ca n't help it . give me a minute and i 'll quit .
boys frightened , lula . this ai n't no good .
i did n't agree to three points over the vig.- what am i nuts ? i did n't need it that much .
what are you gon na do ? fight with him ? he wants his money .
this whole idea -- this date and everything . it was my parents ' idea . they forced me into it .
oh -- that 's very nice of you to tell me .
it sticks out , so i ca n't lock it . look , angelo , you think i joined the fbi to learn to surf ? this was your lame-o idea in the first place . you got ta back me up on this .
johnny , all i can say is we better come up with something real soon .
i 'll probably kill them . is that likely ?
no . and no one is to know of your drinking problem . that includes my wife .
what if i reached a point where you did n't think i was crazy anymore ? if i was normal .
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking coca-cola again .
chuckie 's address . i sneaked a peek at the rolodex .
you sneaked a peek at the rolodex . nice .
we 'll have to satisfy them . what would you say to giving them a joint interview ? i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects .
a joint interview , eh ? that might be all right . we could have our pictures taken together , doctor .
i 'm not hungry . what 's wrong ? i spent all morning on that soup . i thought you liked worm 's wart .
there 's nothing more suspicious than worm 's wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell .
i am so upset , monsieur rick . you know i ca n't understand --
-- forget it , emil . mistakes like that happen all the time .
no wonder we both struck out with her . who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land ?
he 's like the pope . like we 're gon na snake a girl away from the pope .
or do you think we 're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we 'll look the other way , which is arrogant and condescending .
lame , self-serving , arrogant ... guilty as charged .
and here you got two mornings every day . wow , were you < u > born < /u > lucky ?
not a problem unless you 're gon na make --
this is for you , mac . the names of all the headwaiters in town . you can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices .
aw , listen babe , i ca n't let you quit now . you 're not going through with this thing , are you ?
let 's not forget they 're just kids , they do n't vote .
it 's the fall of the roman empire , are you blind ? and we 're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
i like you , kid . why do you got ta make it so hard for me to take care of you ?
mr. reuben , i swear to god , they were out of line .
`` and all the monkeys are n't in the zoo . ''
`` every day you meet quite a few . ''
and yet you started the engine right up . with all those lights drawing all night , the batteries had that much charge . did that strike you odd ?
did n't think about it at the time . so no , it did n't strike me odd .
these open the back door . do n't let him catch you behind the machines ; if he does , you 're trapped . i 'll meet you at the bridge . theo takes the keys . sheila grabs his arm .
you do n't have to do this . we could just cut out of here , go to akron , or anywhere else .
ted seemed to get worse after i told him about simon , doctor .
the human brain is a highly complex organ , elaine , perhaps the most complex next to the bladder . let me show you . ted 's problem is in this area . this area , this area , here , here , here , under here , here ...
sir , i 've always wondered ... why sue ? you could have any woman in the world but --
that 's why . because i could have any other woman ... you know , when they asked caesar `` why england , '' he said , `` because it 's not mine . ''
look at this . an ambyloid reovirus protein . that explains why the computer 's confused . the plant 's infected with a virus .
that 's not so unusual . many plants carry viruses . like the burls on maple trees .
sure , because your new stuff 's a bunch of crap . kaufman , people are sick of you . the wrestling ... the hoaxes ...
hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
you mean smashed ! she called up at midnight last week . talking a bunch of crap . pat ca n't stand her .
it 's a thing she does . she talks at night .
i do n't wear a white wig , i do n't carry a gavel .
that 's a good idea , maybe i will !
how did she meet him ? did dad know ? anything else in that envelope ?
no , i do n't think so . i --
could'a fooled me , the way you were hollering into that cell phone .
different instrument altogether . you know , if you 'd only listened to me , we 'd be bogged down in traffic right now , and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks .
you think i 'm after money ? i told you , my friend . anarchy . time for a change . money is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
so all by yourself , you 're going to destroy every government ; in the world .
& lt ; & lt ; we were there to buy a man and take him back to hungary. & gt ; & gt ;
he says they were buying it does n't make sense . i 'm sorry , i 'm a little rusty . they were there to buy something .
gavin ? gavin elster ? you 'd think i 'd would . no .
i got a call from him today . funny . he dropped out of sight during the war , and i 'd heard he 'd gone east . i guess he 's back . it 's a mission number .
jabez -- once you said we 'd never change --
i was n't used to being big -- was n't used to thinking in big ways . now , i 've made up my mind .
who knew that when i started working in the finest foreign car shop in la , i would also find the light of my life .
yeah , well he left out a couple of steps , ah look , i 've got ta get back to these bills , phil will you help vada get settled ?
i do n't think so . of course i was terribly upset ... i hardly knew what i was doing .
the medical examiner seems to think that the body was touched . he says it looks as if the girl 's hand had been forced open after she was killed ... .
will the elements be gone now forever from this place ?
when mankind comes to its senses . we will return .
ohh , oh sure it 's no big deal , you see all my former clients will eventually die , and all your clients used to be alive , so they have something in common .
you 'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone .
not < u > a building < /u > ! that 's the beauty of it . i think i can buy the < u > whole town < /u > . these people do n't know the value of their property !
then we own a whole < u > town < /u > full of nowhere .
you should 've done what i did . a clean break .
lynette told me it really tore her up when you did n't call this week .
well , uh , alvy , you wanted to break up just as much as i do .
there 's no-no question in my mind . i think we 're doing the mature thing , without any doubt .
just tell me what 's really going on . i think we know each other well enough for me to expect that .
we know each other well enough for me to care how i put something to you which could wipe you out . so i will phrase things the way i think they should be phrased . all right ?
i 'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will ... what we need right now is twenty million dollars .
twenty million dollars is a considerable sum ... i 'll have to discuss that with my minister of finance .
the greatest secret of life is who we truly are . now i must give you that secret , which has been kept from you your whole life . it began on the night when louis was born .
i remember that night . d'artagnan was drunk , the only time i 've seen him that way . the three of us were reveling , remember , athos ?
i 'm no suggesting the worst will happen ... but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe , the next time that happens , down the road -- you should look into it .
ah , damn -- the fucking jerks -- my , god . they want to fire me .
i can accept that , it comes with the job .
bullshit . you 're just like the rest of us .
by the way , are you sure we need a spy ?
sure , we got ta have a spy . if we no got a spy who 's gon na tell the other side what we 're doing ?
sure . take it easy , dude -- i know that you will .
yeah man . well , you know , the dude abides .

well i have to come up with  an outline , i 'd guess you call it . the story . the whole goddamn story . soup to nuts . three acts . the whole goddamn-
it 's alright , barton . you do n't have to write actual scenes ?
lamentable news , jack ... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now .
did you hear ? twas the killing of the unicorn caused it .
okay nels , you can always keep what you 've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about . i 'll bet she can be friendly when it 's in her best interests .
if you 're looking for a quickie all you 've got to do is ask .
i thought you might paste them into your book .
we took several photographs , there 's no need .
it 's romantic , what you 're doing , and they want to be a part of it .
well i 'm so glad that you guys are .
i 'm afraid i ca n't just leave it at that . the commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something . as ship 's counselor , it 's my duty to-
as ship 's counselor , it 's your duty to know not only when you 're needed but also when you 're not .
yes , cats , of course . what else could they be ? cats . of course each one has his own name too .
but there are so many of them . do you know each one separately .
one thing i do n't need is heckling ! you called and asked me for help -- and now you 're acting like a taxpayer !
how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years ?
uh , jack - look , i can explain ...
diane , there 's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins . now , if you guys were really friends , you 'd remind her to take these .
that 's because he 's a fucking wacko . never met a self-promotion scheme he did n't like . what 's he doing now ?
he 's a consultant to a network tv program on profilers . he gets a check every episode .
jesus . what kind of fbi agent are you ?
i 'm your worst fuckin ' nightmare . now , if you do n't want me to keep on hurting you , it 's important that i believe you and right now i do n't . so tell me , where did they go ?
must n't look , little miss . must n't look .
but i saw what it was . it 's the little deer .
different ones . one 's the bible . one of 'ems a book on christmas . one of 'ems how to be a carpenter .
how come you 're carryin ' them around with you .
why do i feel that you know what 's going on ?
are you the type of person who takes advice , miss hillman ?
she needed a job , malcolm . and she 's smart . and she helps me .
i have a bad feeling about what you 're doing .
please do n't misunderstand . i am grateful for your hospitality and --
he is afraid of enchantment ! will you listen to the fool prattle on .
we have work . it pays a lot . unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up .
oooh . sassy . what do you care who feels me up , jake ? unless it kinda gotcha going . did it , jake ? getcha going ?
i do n't like being referred to as babe , or addressed as baby . i do n't like your possessive attitude , nor your hints of secret knowledge . in fact , to be very frank , mr. mitchell , i do n't think i like you .
maybe you 're going to have to like me .
the least you can do is show me a little appreciation .
-- you know how fuckin ' easy this is to me ? this is a joke ! and i 'm sorry you ca n't do this . i really am . 'cause if you could i would n't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up .
so , are you on for the next one ?
i do n't know . everything 's up in the air at this point , no pun intended .
it 's an american boy 's rupture you 're supposed to close .
listen , we get a deluge like this , just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough . so never mind the side issues .
did you go see my cousin maynard like i asked you in my letter ?
of course i did . he said he 'd file an appeal right away . you did n't tell me he was so good looking .
you think you 've been working hard . this muther 'll break your back .
this is a big day for the guards . they get to remind us who 's boss .
ambrose obviously got these from nekhorvich on the plane .
what manic invents disease like that in the first place ? why would he do it ?
when i 'm away , did you ever notice anythin ' funny with her ? tell me the truth .
jack , if there was anything funny , i would tell you .
and another thing , you better stay away from my sister or you better ...
ladies and gentlemen , there is no need to go there . we can all agree to disagree without making threats .
i 'm sorry because i was looking forward to that , but i ' m going back in a few hours .
okay ... it 's so good to see you .
yeah , i 'm a real genius . what choices have i got ? fuck , just because i know about stuff like tonight does n't mean i deal it . i work a job . it beats pumping gas , beats making hamburgers .
you 're telling me it does n't get to you ?
i 'm getting dressed now . i 'll be over . bye .
hey kit , where do i go for the clothes ? good stuff on < u > him < /u > .
mister president , there were thirty-four aircraft involved . thirty acknowledged the recall . that makes four shot down .
hello , are you still there ? ... uh-huh ... i 'll be right back . we 're still working this thing out .
we are not comrades any more ... we are friends , ninotchka .
imagine , we do n't have to whisper any longer .
then without feeling , your guests were also wondering whether the music could n't be a shade more on the - shall we say , happier side ?
if my guests do not like it here , i suggest they accompany you to the nursery where i 'm sure you will all feel more at home .
merely for our records , miss mayfield . it 's usual for the guests who come here for the first time .
i 'm carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks . how much of a deposit would you like ?
listen , asshole , it 's up to us !
they bombed last night , right ? did n't they bomb ? if they bombed last night , they could bomb tonight . they could be up there right now !
i 'm more a hot-blooded killer , huh ? like a soldier . like a samurai .
you wo n't hear that from hooks . because the charge is < u > first < /u > -degree murder , which requires premeditation . he ca n't change the charge .
imam . we should leave soon . before nightfall but while it 's cooler .
what , you 're goin ' off , too ?
yeah , but some of the things they say your brothers 've done ...
there 's all kinds of horses , ai n't there ? same with cowboys . what they do 's their affair . i do n't preach and i do n't judge . i ai n't no dog-catcher .
it 's almost there . the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time .
what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico ?
i do n't understand . what do you want from me ?
i told you already ... i 'm here to set you free ...
aaaaawww man , i was n't plannin ' on goin ' no place . it 's twelve o'clock , man . i 'm home , i 'm high --

i order you to find out where we are !
the man 's gone black , barnes . he 's under until he decides to surface .
look we can use someone from the embassy and we can get the local authorities involved . close off his transportation .
do n't sweat it , man . i needed a kick in the ass . we 're better friends for it .
thanks , man . i 've been hating myself for the last two days .
she came to me for help , she needed money , and i did n't help her . i did n't help her . now she 's dead and it 's my fault .
i 'm not going to say anything -- to marge , or anybody , the police -- it 's a secret between us and i 'll keep it .
i bet she 's a sly little nigger , that girl . would n't mind a piece of her myself !
all right , you get out of here , man !
nicky , no . this is insupportable . how could you ?
i 'm a man . she 's , you know , a woman .
i was in the brig . they gave me a deal . i blew up this colonel 's golf cart with an m-19 . he was n't in it or anything ... it was the symbolic value . seemed like a good idea at the time .
that 's a real good reason to wind up in 'nam .
of course just like that . that 's how you always know when it 's right .
and if it so happens that you 're wrong ? if it just so happens that i could care less about you ?
i think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet .
we better get word to the authorities and -- look !
but they 're not human ! dr. forrester says they 're some kind of an advanced civilization --
if they 're more advanced than us , they should be nearer the creator for that reason !
please ... i don know what to do . i 'm so cold .
do , you know how bad you smell ? the stench , my god .
okay , shitbag . im only going to ask you this once . where is friedman ?

you know , you 're not a bad driver .
you know , you 're not a bad passenger .
i sent for the police . we can explain .
explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles ?
it 's my fault . he 's dead because ... i left those drugs ...
it 's really not all your fault . i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems . personal things , you know . made some bad investments . at least now he 's peaceful ...
you 're not going to be a pop-pop . and juno 's not going to be a ma . somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation . i friggin ' hope .
did you see it coming when she sat us down here ?
cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin ' him . if word gets around that feds are in on it too , gondorff 'll fold up the whole thing .

it 's midnight . what 's the matter , sam ?

comas are unpredictable . he could wake up today , tomorrow , a month from now ...
honey , i have to clarify this . the thing is , dr. edelstein , my brother has an absolute < u > horror < /u > of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
i believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in kontum , is that right ?
i am not presently disposed to discuss that , sir .
we 've all done a poor job of it .
i still say this is my tag . any objections , hoffy ?
unpack nothing . i did n't say i was staying .
suppose you make up your mind . do you want this job or do n't you ?
yeah , a headache . my head hurts . you 're making me uncomfortable .
i 'm making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that does n't bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull .
hello , harvard ! got anything new on the hanging ?
why do n't you fellows get your own news ?
wait a minute ! how do you interrupt the cellular mitosis ? ! ?
ca n't we see the unfertilized host eggs ? !
i hope this prick does n't run . my knees are killing me . stay behind me .
you 're worried for my safety . i 'm touched .
mrs. rogers ? i 'm dwight campbell , with neighborly life insurance . i 'm looking for betty sizemore .
i wish i could help you , but i ca n't .
i ... have come to communicate with my user .
hmm . a difficult proposition ... difficult proposition at best . perhaps you 've noticed ... we 're not exactly packing them in these days ...
well , there you are and watch it with that hoop .
gerron out of it , you 're only jealous 'cause you 're old .
they said that 'd be tomorrow . they just wan na keep an eye on me another night .
fine . i 'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon .
we should n't buy a single slice , spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there .
that 's what i 'm talkin ' 'bout . that 's what i 'm talkin ' 'bout .
this thing 's actually accurate . i bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on sunset ...
you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant .
i 'd love to ... you know ... hang with some of you guys .
people are pretty cagey . who do you know ?
we 've got to do something . we 've got to turn around .
we can see them , they can see us . we run , they chase .
we 're okay ... we 're good , dad .
hey , what about the amazin 's ? they pull it off ?
what do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door ?
one thing i do n't need is heckling ! you called and asked me for help -- and now you 're acting like a taxpayer !
what you do n't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy .
but you do n't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious , do you ?
that was taken nine years ago ... i.d . 'd as michael hanover . sentenced to months in the state penn at rawlins , wyoming for armed robbery . he escaped from custody after days . has n't been seen or heard from since .
zack ... he made it ... he 's alive ...
you would n't consider going over niagara falls without a barrel ?
'at's-a no good . i went to niagara falls once .
most of all , i want to find out who i am . by finding my parents . learning my `` human '' name . simple stuff that the good people of gotham take for granted .
and exactly < u > why < /u > am < u > i < /u > gon na help < u > you < /u > ?
he 's going to be fine , right daddy ?
the bullet came out clean , but he lost a whole lot of blood . praying would n't hurt .
a black panther was a member of an african american militant group in the sixties , marcel . i think you 're referring to the pink panther .
pink panther , black panther . who gives a shit ? and i do n't remember asking you a god damn thing , you little turd .
you ca n't tempt me . do you hear ? i wo n't eat !
please . i ca n't fight on an empty stomach . remember what napoleon said .
i told you . two days , we 'd have to camp .
yes , < u > camp < /u > , i thought that meant holiday inn , i never heard `` tents '' , will there be toilets ?
he 's treading water . do n't mention khrushchev .
... an open invitation for mr. khrushchev to become involved in latin america . we would lose all our friends in latin america .
so why all the secrecy ? why are n't you guys working with the us military ?
i am not permitted to speak of such things .
it washes off . i tell them we 're doing it the same way as before . they 'll follow sheronda . i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall .
she wo n't have no problems 'cause she do n't know nothin ' .
i ai n't doin ' you no way . i just ai n't climbin ' in that trunk . i got a problem with small places .
well , my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful , peanuthead niggas outta jail , but i do it --
we could have talked first , saved a lot of running around .
you was n't listening , you did n't want to talk .
you want to buy it , put it in the club ?
you want me to buy dead cat ? it 'll scare people away .
them boys was tryin ' to pull me down pretty hard .
you 're strong though . you let me make them touchdowns so i 'd feel good . my daddy used to do that kind of thing .
in the name of elric , prince of elves , demon begone .
good . you conquer the demon , but your horse is sinking in the bog . what do you do ?
i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship 's money and pearls .
mr. o'higgins , we are in your debt , and rest assured , sir , you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin . mister o'higgins , i wonder if i know your good father ?
looks like her boyfriend did it . rod lane . musician type , arrests for brawling , dope --
terrific . what the hell was she doing there ?
i want to know what he told you last night .
i -- i did n't really pay much attention -- bobby has such an active imagination .
just a little . i 've had a tough day .
i do n't see the humor in this . go to your room immediately . you 're grounded .
one day you will learn to respect other people 's time , lydia , one day you --
evan , i am so sorry , you were a saint to wait for us !
actually , the only thing i got ta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to greaseball-land .
yeah , well , that pizza could feed a family of four in turkey or india or wherever the fuck he comes from .
so , mr. white ? can i go ahead and make my travel arrangements ?
exactly what i was about to ask about me .
do you mind if i take my new porsche for a ride ?
kathryn , the only thing you 're going to be riding is me . now if you 'll excuse me , i have some work to do .
well , i mean ... i know this is an emotional moment , but let 's not make snap judgments . let 's move cautiously . first , this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
they can bill me . i got a tab running . what 's second ?
fred krueger 's dead . you always had a little trouble understanding that , princess .
you know what he did . he 's doing it again .
oh fuck you , and fuck monica while you 're at it . but i guess that 's what i interrupted .
jesus , sally . you are a medical miracle . the only person who 's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier .
pretty much . you know , george , wish we could send harry to college with you . your mother and i talked it over half the night .
we have that all figured out . you see , harry 'll take my job at the building and loan , work there four years , then he 'll go .
a weirdo making s+m films ? who 'd have thought it ?
his stuff comes out of new york . bondage and fetish videos , gothic hardcore . definitely not for the squeamish .
yes . there 's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body . there 's chrom , which is fairly benign , and then there 's chrom , hexavalent chromium , which , depending on the amounts , can be very harmful .
harmful , like -- how ? what would you get ?
you could n't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse , how you gon na get a gun ?
that 's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden .
were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory ?
they spurred onto high ground , my lord , full of spirit and looking for the zulu . full of sport they were , my lord .
when they did my eyes , i made them promise i 'd still be able to cry . sounds stupid , does n't it ?
no . it 's important to be able to feel those things . we 're going to pull this run off , molly , and we 've got to do it soon .
it 's important - he knows the last chapter .
your book - that 's why you were always in the cellar !
yes , mr. zorg , i hear you perfectly ! so , how was the concert ?
who gives a shit ! i did n't come here to listen to music ! listen up instead of running off at the mouth ! the batteries on my phone are almost gone .
sorry , son . i ca n't do it . you signed the 1240/a . it would be illegal .
sir , i know it was wrong . i did n't learn from one mistake and i made another , sir . sir , my family ... my whole family was in buenos aires , sir .
i ca n't help myself . i do n't know what 's the matter with me .
shit , james , you 're hungover . what do you think 's the matter with you ?
twist ! when did you get back in town ?
coupla days ago . i 'm workin ' a big one with gondorff on the north side .
you 're not going to shoot me , earl . i 'm your friend , remember ? i 've got to write that story about your `` production for use '' .
yes -- that 's right . production for use .
i can tell her you 're all tied up in the projection room . i can give her the brush ...
listen , thirty million fans have given her the brush . is n't that enough ?
meditations on a banana slug was a delightful read .
thank you so much . i love slugs . all slugs , not just banana slugs .
the date stamp on the picture is last < u > month < /u > . is that where you and rachel conduct business .
it 's not real ... that 's not me .
is that a nice way to talk to a pal ?
do n't let money spoil a beautiful friendship . look at these here telegrams to be delivered ! this ai n't a job -- it 's a marathon .
i 've loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you , jeremiah . i 've just always been too scared to show it .
beth , i ca n't believe you just said that because that 's exactly how i 've always felt about you ... call me jam . it 's my band name .
you 're way more philosophical than i could ever be .
i just do n't go in with any expectations .
anyone not in your family , is a stranger . believe me , when trouble comes , your country wo n't take care of you .
that 's how it was in the old world , pop , but this is not sicily .
funny you should say that while we 're out looking for gold .
you 're the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad .
i know who you are , ma'am . how 's the eye ?
productive . so they 're closing down the school ?
you have the best answer for everything . you seem so ... hopeful . are you always this sunny ?
no one ever thought so . you must bring it out .
why not ? she 's an attractive young woman .
young ? she arrived here in she was at the time . she was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains . the whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people .
we 're fine . we 're great . we 're having a baby and we 're moving to london .
well , you were n't fine last summer when you went sylvia plath on me in connecticut .
you must have a rather strange impression of us .
the first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle .
who 'd you go with ? that 's not good .
how 'd you do it ? the new you .
hello mr. kastle . junior , long time . i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden !
is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock ? junior looks from one man to the other , breathing heavily , his nostrils flaring .
i 'm sorry , there 's no way we can .
do n't worry . you 'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb . we can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon .
very well . that means that you have met all mr. holland 's requirements . now , as to salary -- it 's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month .
that is good . but i 'd like to know more about the case .
okay . i understand . i 'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and ... maybe you 'll let me read something then .
wendy , let me explain something to you . whenever you come in here and interrupt me , you 're breaking my concentration .
sometimes she can be quite careless . why do n't you try mrs. redi ?
i have written repeatedly to mrs. redi . she vouchsafes no information whatsoever . it is six months since your tuition has been paid , mary . naturally , it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil .
dwayne robinson . well , what have you learned ? what do they want ?
the terrorists ? do n't know , sir . we have n't heard a peep from them .
one of those computer geniuses , is n't it ?
you 're right ! and this boy tapped into that main link between tokyo and the new york stock exchange . he can give us , when it 's really useful , a seven second delay in that movement of information . do you know what that means ?
you 've got nothing , you do n't have a witness ...
and i 've got a witness ! your mr. white saw the crime .
wander separately ? ah , but only one is a wanderer . two , together , are always going somewhere .
no ... no , i do n't think that 's necessarily true .
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom , i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube ! you do n't deny that . do you ?
deny it ! i 'm proud of it ! we beat the whole country on that story .
but she told him , frances . she told him about us .
i know this is difficult for you . i know that you love her .
you called me , i knew they were there , so what do i need these for ?
well , i do n't know ... call it a fringe benefit .
i watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other 's lipstick -
what are you talking about ? sugar and me , we 're just like sisters .
i hope so . listen , mr. mckenna , about your wife : if i had known she was married --
it would n't have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you 're a man without scruples .
frank , he went off , too . he ai n't gon na be in there when you get indoors .
where 'd he go ? what 's goin ' on ?
all over . turkish army up there . it 's against the law . they shoot us . you sure you looking for your friends , man ?
okay ! ley me out right here . i 'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you . i 'll walk it .
god , i do n't know what it was called . i never saw it . i only got twenty- five bucks for the whole goddamned thing .
i thought you were quite good in it . i also like the girl in it . really thought she was good . i wondered if she was still around . if she was still working .
slide them down your nose . now look at me over the top . and you read printed matter through the bottom .
amazing ! i do n't know what to say --
i 'm a director sid , i direct . for example , angelina over there , she 's my partner . i can convince her to do anything . we 've been dating since i met her in woodsboro .
oh my god , angie crick ? from english class ?
forgive me , father , for i have sinned . this is my first confession in ... well ... a really long time .
prepare to receive the act of penance . how many sins have you committed since your last confession ?
i stopped by the station a while ago . i stared at the bus . i could almost hear the kids inside . there was a lawyer there . he told me he 'd gotten you signed up . is that true ?
something made this happen , billy . mr. stephens is going to find out what it was .
i hope so . we got ta go soon .
baby , relax . it 's just down the hall . she 's got ta change ... we 'll be fine .
where were you ? on a ... uh , * mission ?
ssshhh ! we say op . covert * operation . and this one got a little rough .
of course it 's a good idea ... it 's our plan .
but how are you gon na pay rent and everything ? you do n't even have a job .
you tell them if they come up to seventy-five , i 'll cut them in on the crystal lake package .
do n't tell me you 're still thinking of buying casa de psycho ...
gee , you shamuses are a tough audience , but what happened to you that was so dark , lurid , embittering ?
you wan na know ? well , since you 're so goddamn curious , i 'll tell ya . one of you toons killed my brother .
then our first target will be the initial landing place outside los angeles .
i 'll request the scientists from pacific-tech to monitor the drop . we 'll clear the area all around . after that we 'll hit them all over the world . i 'll have long-range bombers alerted , loaded and standing by .
i remember him . got in a car crash or somethin ' .
we were celebrating right after the draft , going from bar to bar . i was drivin ' .
pulls wade 's hands from the wound . pours sulfa powder .
about to pour his sulfa . sees the wound . stops . knows it 's fatal .
what is it , admiral ? i 'm under the gun here .
i just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs .
i 'm will stanton , and um ... i 've had a little accident , as you can see .
accident my ass . i thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here .
we worked for that money . we were gon na put together enough to get out of that dump we live in , get off this street .
viv ... do n't be stupid . we 're whores .
listen , your aunt ester just died . i 'm ... sorry ... listen , i really feel bad now about last night ... we had no ...
i 'm in a hurry , gon na see this great group record at woodland .
no , no , no ... . we 'll punch < u > in < /u > a kitten . um ... < u > later < /u > .
... you 're gon na punch in a kitten later .
but i mean , why do you need to steal ? could n't you get a job ?
get a job doing what ? you got ta be a member of a union , no union card - no job . to join the union , you got ta get the job , but you do n't get the job without the card .
in the pot , i have got a good dinner . not a sausage or stew , but a singer . not a sausage or stew but a singer . is the treat that i 'll eat for my meat !
oh shut up . i 'm sick to death of that tune .
there it is ... in red and white ! `` springtime for hitler , '' signed , sealed and delivered . what 's the matter with you ?
look , i 'm just not wearing this arm band . i do n't care how big the deal is .
no , i mean it 's growing , it 's part of us . and we cut it off . and throw it away .
come on , eddie , you 're gon na scare the kid .
you can be cocky now , boy . but you wo n't make it . you wo n't last . i just feel sorry for josie . i knew it would n't work out .
well , at least she ai n't married to no white man 's nigger ! you been stoopin ' so long , reverend , you do n't even know how to stand straight no more . you ' just half a man !
i 'll pay the rest next trip . we only caught sixty ton of skipjack around san benedict . we hit a chubasco , they do n't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore .
forget it . i only mention it to illustrate a point ...
tryin ' to save his girl , man . he 's in another world .
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass , i 'd just leave town .
okay , group 's in session . straight talk only in this room .
today i 'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member , nancy thompson . let 's make her feel welcome .
fag ? ass ? i 'm sorry , is that a joke ?
poor taste . i know . listen , i respect homosexuals . when i was young , my maid was a homosexual . my maid was a homosexual .
i have crawled through the gutter ... through every wrinkle in the human brain .
what i 'm saying . but you still come out this goofball romantic .
i do n't see anybody in there but you .
i would appreciate a little space . thank you .
no -- it 's not that . it 's ... i 'm just a little on edge . i 'm really sorry .
hey , you do n't have to appologize to me . i 'm the one . i understand . i 'm going to take a walk and dry off .
you 'll have no need for that , highlander .
since we hardly know each other , i 'm sure you 'll understand if i hold one to it for awhile .
no , immediately . the people are demoralized . leave this to me ...
no . not you , or any one of us . as long as we are free , the nlf continues to exist in the casbah . if they manage to take us too , there wo n't be anything left ... and from nothing comes nothing ...
kind of feeling your oats this morning . i have n't laid a hand on you for quite a while , but that does n't mean you 're too old .
what makes you think you 're so almighty ? telling people what to do and how to act when you do n't even know how yourself .
yeah , dangerous cult . do n't make eye contact or they might talk to you .
do n't we want them to talk to us ?
i do n't know , sir . we just spoke a few minutes ago .
youddo n't think i 'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important , do you , major ?
sure -- certainly - but what 's that got to do with this ?
that 's what i do n't understand -- why should it come here -- and why did n't it stay here ? it 's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt .
it 's on the lake right in the middle of seattle . it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
i hope i do n't have to pay for that piece of information .
oh yes , well , come to think of it , they 're right . we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them . but you could n't approach them . they were a wise bunch of birds .
your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car . dave , is n't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun ?
the fight 's set -- i do n't need a manager .
look , you ca n't buy what i know . ya ca n't . i 've seen it all ! i got pain an ' i got experience .
he 's got that sega saturn cd , bit , right ?
yeah . what would you think if we went there to live for a while ?
do n't forget there 's a dead watchman downstairs .
i did n't kill him ! i had nothing to do with that , i tell you ! i was home in my apartment last night - i can prove it !
i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof , you would have rebuilt the whole damn house .
you always got the best of it around here and when dad always talks about my son , it is always you , so you fix the roof .
what the bloody hell d'you think you 're doing ?
our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not , shall we say , satisfactory , yes ?
well ... i 've been on blind dates before ... matter of fact , to be honest , i 've been picked up before . okay .
i 'll get my car and be back in half an hour .
rose , you do n't look well and you have n't eaten a bit of breakfast .
i 'm not hungry . i ca n't eat nothin ' , i have n't been able to eat since i got fired . i think maybe i 'm sick .
... do you think we should look for him ?
i do n't think so , he should be along soon ...
you 've been cheating on me have n't you ?
yes i had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction .
ironic . when man was killing these creatures , he was destroying his own future ...
the beasties seem happy to see you , doctor . i hope you like our little aquarium .
she 's doing like those iranians . `i divorce thee . i divorce thee . i divorce thee '
and he hears it the same time i hear it ? what happened to family secrets ?
i do n't know why . i just could n't help it .
but sooner or later we 've got to end this relationship . and it 's better to do it right now .
intelligent question , nels . i believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity .
that bitch . what 's keeping you from taking off ?
ah . that 's what i was going to do .
oh , yes , i forgot : it 's your occupation , is n't it ?
i like walkin ' quite a bit from time to time .
i stay on my feet all the time at work . i just ca n't find shoes that 's comfortable .
you should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
but i had to . it was the only way to get to you --
sex wax ? you 're not into kinky shit , are you angelo ?
surfers use it on their boards . they rub sand into it for traction .
medication ? what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer ?
it was part of the treatment i intended ... i did n't know what the effects would be ...
hello , jack , i do n't know anything , jack .
yes , you do , albert . talk or i 'll kill you .
you do ? i 'm glad . because i feel for you --
and i have a feeling for you too , because you 're just like -- i feel for you like you 're -- you 're just like --
so if his head struck something narrow and flat , the gunnel of a boat , a net roller , a fairlead , could that have ...
if the head was moving fast enough , but i do n't see how it could be .
wh . . . what are you talking about ?
this morning when i came in on you and grace , you swore you had n't so much as been near the bedroom . now you make straight for it .
i guess it 's hard working on the road like that .
damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week .
no . most of them are in transit by now . i 'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security .
okay , then . i leave it in your able hands .
i mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly .
aw julie , it 's my job . it 's like being a doctor .
a leech on the welfare state in addition . you do n't miss a trick .
i fiddle it . they got me down as an immigrant with five kids .
first let 's see what happens if we play it cool .
what ? you think she 's gon na tell her pit-boss on us ?
i wish i could spare a few centuries to learn .
it took us centuries to learn that it does n't have to take centuries to learn .
brother , we decided to leave this place just one day too late , you know ?
well , there 's sure as hell nothing to stop us now . everybody we know between here and bixby is already dead .
as i say , she 's ... something of a recluse . that 's how she 's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art .
do n't be ridiculous . i arranged a press conference .
i 'm going to miss you , too , pop . what 's the matter ? you look tired .
oh , i had another tussle with potter today .
i ca n't believe we 've come this far only to be stopped by this ! scotty , is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized ?
sorry , sir . we ca n't even do that in the 23rd century .
um , do you think you can give me a lift home tonight ?
i 'm going to have a word with that asshole .
but that 's what i need . to be sure ... to be absolutely sure ...
shh . it 's okay son . there is but one truth . one thing you can be absolutely sure of . and that thing is this :
jesus christ , the man does n't want to talk , so get off his back an ' let 's get on to some new business .
mister mcmurphy , the purpose of this meeting is therapy . group therapy .
what do you want me to do , chief ?
i 'm not telling you what to do . what i will say , is < u > right < /u > < u > now < /u > , that child 's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
well , i guess some people have it and some do n't .
do you think i have it , dr. venkman ?
of course , his eagerness to leave his mother 's womb also meant he was the one selected .
in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue .
you swear ? that 's great . i feel so much better now .
i do n't want anything but a ride . all i want to do is go home .
in the yellow room , where the music 's playing and the ladies are ?
where the music 's playing and the ladies are ...
no . he was wearing a mask ... but i saw the cut on his wrist . it was peter .
i ca n't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist . do you have someone you can stay with tonight ?
... sittin ' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar ! and let me tell you something else . i did n't join the service to let people like you turn ...
... the united states into the kind of country we 're supposed to be fighting against .
you walked out on a job for me , and i wo n't ruin that .
exactly because i know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts . _ .
you mean they 'll replace you with someone who wo n't perform abortions .
well , we can only guess about that , edna . they *are* against the law .
i do n't know . 'cause you 're cute .
ya hear , joey ? she thinks this face is cute ? hey , whatcha doin ' now ? you wan na go for a ride ?
it 's dad 's grail diary . every clue he ever followed . every discovery he made . a complete record of his search for the holy grail . this is his whole life . why would he have sent this to me ?
i do n't know . but someone must want it pretty badly .
yeah . i mean , you are my brother and ... well i should have found another way of expressing my disappointment . so , i 've decided to make it up to you .
you gon na forget about the money i owe you ?
turn right on timonioum road . hurry , dad !
if mom 's a psycho , scotty will still be ok , wo n't he ?
oh , mom  i 'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen .
oh , no you do n't . harry , now , not my best haviland .
i 've waited my whole life for this job , but i do n't have a shot in hell of getting it . do you know why ?

i just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time . bud how many guys were there ?
three . the last one was manager of a finance company , back home in pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts , but he asked me to wait for him -- he 'll be out in .
it 's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
this child let loose the beast from its cage --
lord , never thought i 'd live to see my boy in prison .
mom ! it was n't like that . it was bullsh ... they were just harassing us . no charges were filed . it 's alright .
not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television .
that 's right , buzz , and you know when i did it ? last match , last frame . all i needed was one spare for the crown - and i get stuck with the seven-ten , the fazeli split .
i just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive . there 'll be no buzzing around tonight .

well , if you want to get her in the sack , tell her you love her . that 's how i was duped .
i told her you would never invent such a preposterous name .
i told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name .
the men here used it for a trap door , so we had to remove it temporarily .
how long is temporarily ? i trust not until july .
you ca n't back out on me now . we need to be sure .
sure of what ? who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle ? results are what lareaux would want .
here . look . this is me and sarah when i was still at city college .
that 's sarah ? i can see what you mean .
and , i 'm asking you to trust me without understanding why .
well , in that case ... of course , son .
and this trip to the valley . i ca n't imagine why i 'd allow you to drag me down here . why , we do n't know anything about these people . we 're not even armed !
they 're very nice people - except that they 've got horns .

i beg your pardon ! i turn myself inside out to help you and now i 'm a heavy . here 's your shoe , there 's your coat , that 's the door !
a famous actor who 's getting married next week .

i think we 'd better discuss this in my office , mr. mitchell .
nothing to discuss . tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter . be grateful for small mercies .
the wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we 're underway , we 'll never catch them .
we need only to come about , to put them in range of the long nines .
rave parties ? ! that 's so typical - you would think it was called rage . perfect !

he says it 's a game . all games have a strategy .
all you got ta do is look at the map .
i know . he came to me , told me about the missing data stream . he was concerned that you might find it .
i did find it . it was inside of agatha all this time . so the question is , why would someone want this erased from the data file ?
at twelve twenty . i know . lyons two , four , seven , one . two more days and we 'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more !
well , we 'll have to take what 's here . a bird in hand is worth two in jail .
obviously , the british government denies all of this -

negative . absolutely not . the phase two assault team will get them out .
beware of the puget debs -- and we all laughed , especially him .

you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you ... speak his mind . one who was n't afraid to tell you what he wanted .
i did . i did , reed ... but i wanted you to be that man .
who is to say our morals are better than hers ? but maybe you 're right . she could ... influence dolly ...
that is exactly what i 'm afraid of . the girl has got to go , darlin ' .
i want to help with the family finances . i want you to buy some stocks . and gold . by gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce . then you sell .
do you know how ridiculous you sound ? first of all , it 's illegal for u.s. citizens to buy gold . and in the second place , the price of gold is regulated by the government .
just say what you have to say , woman . what other people think should n't matter to you .
of course i shall say what i have to say . i always do .
why do you come to me ? why do i deserve your generosity ?
i need two million dollars in cash ... more important , i need a friend who has people in high places ; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested , they would get only light sentences . be my friend .
it was done . when sophia put the kids to bed , america brought otis in the room and closed the door . it was done .

there 's always an excuse , is n't there ?
i growed up and got taught it ai n't right to kill nobody .
it 's okay if you 're lookin ' out for yourself . if it 's self-defense . was it self-defense ?
i was remembering how much this meant to me . it was after the war ... i had nothing ... except my life . how different i was then - and yet how the same .
you 've never cried before . i never thought you would . i thought , despite anything , you could always be happy .
no problem for me either . honestly , it 's no problem .
i 'd really rather take care of it myself .
what ? that new mystery girl you 've been seeing ?
no . i 'll tell you sometime . not now . do n't want to jinx it . but it could take the edge off that jail time i got coming .
where 's his boat , then ? where 's his crew ? he ai n't gon na be out here by himself , that 's for damn sure .
she 's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we 'd never know it .
so this guy walks into a bar and says ...
we did n't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night .
not bad - not good - but not bad . you ought to be able to fool about almost anybody .
is that so ? well , have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph ?
good afternoon , mr. powers , i 'm the destructacon i 'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point . you might as well surrender . resistance is futile . your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to ...
well , destructacon , you have quite a head on your shoulders , i dare to coin .
i will be happy if i have you . i love you .
that wo n't make any difference . we just ca n't live together . and you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo janet .
ah , adam , you do n't know anything about little girls . she 's just ... missed out on some love , that 's all ...
let 's see if she can get my model back .
no , no , no , i told you . they 're fine . they 're all real happy .
my next delivery is up that way , so i 'll be getting down to it real soon .
there is no way parker killed those guards . no way .
i think we both know who did . what 's so urgent ?
the bus 'll pick you up over there . uh ... you got enough bread for a ticket ?
enough to get to jersey . i 'll walk the rest of the way . i 've been sitting a long time . nice meeting you . it 's been a trip .
maybe it 's a game . maybe he 's trying to send us a message .
it does n't matter now . we 've just got to be the first ones there . get everybody up . i want them all activated .
i 'm jonah . that 's my dad . his name is sam .
hi , jonah . sam . and who is this ?
well , maybe that 's it . i 'm chicken .
go on home . just leave me the money .
i could n't mail it ; i did n't know your address . but i had a landmark . i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you .
the first time i 've been grateful for coit tower .
i 'm sure he 's alright , bea . they 'll find him somewhere .
it 's over a month . the police say it happens all the time .
they must 've learned how to control water ... i mean at a molecular level . they can plasticize it , polymerize it ... whatever . put it under intelligent control .
maybe their whole technology is based on that . controlling water .
i 'm in the hudson bay company 's store . that man last night -- the one that followed me --
i do n't think that 's on the market anymore . i 'd like something much closer to the water .
the character that 's supposed to be me , susan alexander --
marion , everyone knows you 're not like that --
the source was ... shall we say , completely reliable .
the report is entirely untrue . i can assure you of that .
that key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt . now how could somebody get to it without you knowing ?
look , i have n't been near that ... that refrigerator .
my little baby . do n't try to grow up so fast .
oh mom , i forgot you were ever so young .
pretty old . i 'll be twenty-two in august .
that 's a ripe old age - what do you do ?
nobody tells me to fire anyone . i told them : shove it up the big one . sorry . i said , you want to fire him , come over and do it yourself .
you know they wo n't do it . it 's up to you . you got ta be strong .
the greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life , blockhead , is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of ergo the magnificent .
your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast , magnificence .
did n't look that way -- you know -- from a distance .
i lied . to her . she thought she 'd seen you .
assuming i go along with this , when can i have the five hundred ?
whenever you want it . the money 's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags , you know ? in a locker at the airport , waiting to be picked up .
deathly afraid of it . her people were poor tenant farmers and she does n't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals .
a tenant farm ? are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt ?
jack , it 's a sitcom -- you 're not defining pi .
i 'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran . want some ?
it 's not your fault . mike , please get off the case .
it is my fault ! i 'm responsible for her !
maybe we should go with them . like you said , your space lab connections can deal with this thing . at least we 'll be safe .
they are not going anywhere . i cut power to the shuttle .
maybe if you 'd come to the backers party , i would 've gotten the money .
that 's moronic . why would a bit player impress a backer ?
i 'll kill you ! you wo n't get the other disk !
if you shoot me , he 'll kill your daughter . do you want to lose both of them ?
-- we had the gun on him tonight -- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five . miles an hour , , , . he 's got the best young arm i 've seen in years .
but he ai n't quite sure which plane he 's on , y'know what i mean ...
i 'm afraid you have mistaken my motive , louis . i thought you might understand and sympathize .
i have no sympathy for either good or evil . i have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity . what unhappy people most of you are !
you son of a bitch . you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait . i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing .
i was n't sure the money was still there until we saw luther . you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once , not twice , jack .
oh . no . sorry . i 'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . i mean , if you need some aspirin , or --
i 'm gon na take a warm bath and sack out . -- you 've been really sweet . sleep tight , okay ?
oh , please tell me , elizabeth , how exactly does one suck a fuck ?
we will not have this kind of language at the dinner table .
i would never hurt you , liza . think whatever you want , but do n't think that .
i do n't . i know you would n't .
it 's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets . that voicebox of yours is a hoot . say `` i 'm wearing no underwear '' -- it 'll be funny.. you do know you 're evil , do n't you ?
a superhero 's job is to protect society . do n't blame me if society is a horrible , corrupt joke .
that 's right , dave , i 'm headed for glenville on a whisperin ' jet .
hey , girl ! hey , you , give us another drink ! dumb little bitch , supposed to give us two in the first place .
takes a licking but keeps on ticking ... ... for a while anyway .
what can i do ? tell me what to do .
i see . so when a man tries to rescue another man , he 's a hero . but when he tries to rescue a woman , he 's gone soft .
could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear , lieutenant ?
what do you suppose anybody wants ? money , money , money !
listen , i told you i was n't interested in that deal , did n't i ?
you 're out of your mind . we ca n't do a job like this with no rehearsal .
there 's no way to practice this . and no time . besides , i 've planned it all . there are n't any surprises .
alexandretta . it 's a great moment in henry 's life . he turns aside , lost to himself for a moment , then turns to indy with joy .
alexandretta ... of course ... on the pilgrim trail from the eastern empire . oh , junior ...
how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
flowers are continual reminders of our mortality . do you appreciate flowers ?
no . they make me sick . they smell like death ... i had two brothers die young . but let me tell you , there are worse things than death . there is such a thing as evil .
did you get a report from the m.e . ?
sure . but i would like to ask you something . you got a problem with me ?
oh , you do ? with all your legal expertise , you believe that ?
okay , fine . i do n't know shit about shit . but i know the difference --
i know . you loved her . so did i. it was an awful shock to me , too . an awful shock . rose was so alive it 's hard to believe .
i ca n't believe it , daddy . i know it must be true , but i ca n't believe it .
that was a stupid thing you did . incredibly stupid .
i tried , arnie . and , i will continue to try .
do you think this is a wise course of action ?
we 're about to find out ... power up disruptors and fire on my mark .
here 's the number of my dentist , he 's first rate . ring him up , he 'll look after you .
thanks , basil . maybe the nineties are n't so bad after all .
i have no desire to see the world again , but if you order me to ...
the retreat will start soon . you can leave tomorrow morning .
we never reveal our sources , which is why you can talk to us .
it 's safe , try it , you 'll see .
no , anything is possible . it 's up to joe .
joe , you do n't know how glad i am you 're aboard . anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man , i 'm in his corner .
i hope you know what you mean to me . not just because of what you 're doing . because of who you are .
i do know , gary . i feel the same way . i thought i was coming here for a job . but it 's meant a lot more .
you just get cranky when you 're tired , that 's all . i told you that you should n't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself .
i 'm not cranky . and that futon was not too big to carry myself-
oh , no . the fan club is real . but they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros .
so , of course , you could n't kill simone because there never was a simone .
not that well sir . i believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building . did we aquire a bank from chicago or a charity ?
relax , son . they 'll learn in time that you do n't fuck with first bank . this is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong . my daddy always told me that only the strong survive .
take his gag out , it 's more fun with the screaming .
yeah , i like the screaming too ... it 's so much more exciting .
you are right . but it is a trap .
so what ? i 'd rather die covered in blood , than an old man , lying in my own piss .
is that what i did ? dave ? i humiliated you ? my god ... i 'm sorry ...
sittin ' on top of the world , sittin ' on top of the world , everything 's fucking peachfuzz ...
you would have had a full scale revolt on your hands .
what have i got now ? it 's exactly as if there were two emperors . because of this the people have two minds . he is their champion .
naw , i do n't believe you have . i do n't reckon i never been in here . this store did n't used to be here .
it 's been here seventeen years . did you live here before or something ?
look at me , dude , do i look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
oh i do n't know , i think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you would n't admit to in a million years .
i 'm throwing the money , walter ! we 're not fucking around !
the bridge is coming up ! gim me the ringer , dude ! chop-chop !
you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want to , but i might be able to help .
you do n't know me from a hole in the wall .
you 're not making sense , baxter . what 's this all about ?
i did n't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who i mean -- i found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills .
ow ! no , it 's okay . it 's better tight .
and anyway , what do i know about guerrilla warfare ?
you -- uh -- you better relax , senator . you 'll be plumb wore out .
tell me , miss saunders -- what time does the senate -- uh -- what do they call it ?
what 's wrong , sweetheart ? somethin ' botherin ' you ?
mama . i been thinkin ' about her . she 's prob'ly worried to death by now .
cute . tell me you would n't want to go out again . after all the talking we 've been doing .
the key word here is talk , dante . i think the idea , the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date .
if you ca n't do the time , do n't do the crime ?
oh . i almost forgot . there is one last thing : before q retired , he asked that i give you one other protective device .
hey ! what do you think you 're doin ' ?
sorry , eddie , i forgot you 're not a toon .
they ... they killed him . i ... thought you know that . i thought you knew because ...
nobody did n't kill ned , he went south yesterday . he did n't even kill nobody . why would anybody kill ned ?
you did n't happen to be going to worth 's place , did you ?
no , sir , i 'm sure it was n't there .
with an indian representative out there , we hope to keep hostilities dormant ; this is a cointelpro , selective operations unit , and it 'll be easier on agent couture if you can gain the people 's trust and maybe --
woh , excuse me , sir ... i see what you 're saying ... i 've got a little indian blood , that 's true . but -- i am not an ... an indian . i ca n't just go in and --
your mom knows all about the face , okay ? do n't worry , she 'll tell the face to beat it .
will you come and say good-night to me every night ?
we had to take it on account of the safe .
for ourselves ... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants ' quarters .
i 'm gon na break your fucking head ! you fucking jerkoff !
sir ! sir , i 'm sorry ! he did n't mean it ! he was trying to get me .
would you be thinking ... ramming speed , sir ?
i would , mr. doyle ! are you game ?
and you 're gon na do just that . but i 'll tell you what to feed the pig . you alright with this ?
yeah ... i guess . any of other panthers know about this ?
with light clothing and no supplies , this is nobody 's territory .
you sound like the tourists . know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine . fuck you . you wo n't make it off this mountain .
thanks , much . good luck with the genital tucking .
i do n't need luck . i 'm good .
do n't you die on me ! ! this is baby suggs quilt . is that what you planning ! ?
oh , i do n't have no plans . no plans at all .
oh ! oh , no ! i think i 've done enough experimenting for one day . congratulations , cyril . you 've convinced me that you 're a philanderer of the very first order . i shall recommend you highly .
please , please do n't laugh at me , phyllis . i must see you tonight !
i remember words i said to jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her , to madden her .
that 's past -- that 's over and done with ...
take it easy . what could you do ? i mean , she threw herself at you , right ?
i 'm in a bad fuckin ' spot here . you know that ? bad fuckin ' spot .
oh i do ... but i say i do n't .
if anyone ever spoke to me , the way i heard ... the way she spoke to you , i do n't think i could ever laugh again .
ah ha , it 's coming off now , sir .
eh ... mr. grady ... were n't you once the caretaker here ?
none of you know anything about it . now go . and andy , if you persist in playing doctor , leave , with them .
i 'm the only friend you 've got , darling , and i do n't intend to stop doing what i think is good for us .
hold on , hold on . i 'm trying to help you , if you 're on the square , and i think you are .
then why are you telling me a crazy lie ? ...
people more serious about their work . you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it ?
you mean i should speed up and try and lose them ?
this is something else . they 're curious . curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture .
i 'm quite sure nothing will happen , doctor .
that 's a good , strong name . do your friends call you john ? or jack .
john . old friends . acquaintances call me scottie .
ramona ... no , pomona , that 's it .
pomona ! you 'll be in the car the whole time ... look , let 's make this easy . i have a spare bedroom . it 's not huge , but the kids would love to have you at the house .
and you 've put it over -- have n't you ?
why not ? i give 'em a great show -- and you know -- we 're doing capacity , sally -- and all < u > nice < /u > people --
so you 'll bring him to me , tomorrow , 10:00 a.m. ? mr ... ?
bytes . mr. bytes . he 'll be there .
mom , this is a farm . we 've got real strawberries growing outside , we 've got real cream .
oh no , the prodigal son 's home . we bring out the store bought .
of course something happens . you put the vibe out to thirty million chicks , you know something 's gon na happen .
that 's the idea , rat . that 's the attitude .
oh no , i want to hear everything . you made twenty pictures in all --
twenty-one . the romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking . the horror pictures were trifles . grand guignol for the masses .
no . actually i think it 's fucking crazy , i do n't know if i could do it .
thanks for clearing that up . i hear your former girlfriend is going out with greg barnett .
george - you 're behaving like a child . you have n't opened your mouth in two weeks .
i do n't see that there 's anything to say .
is there anything else i should know about him ?
speak when you 're spoken to . he likes his women quiet .
but there 's only three of us , and he 's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal .
then maybe it 's time for us to form our own brotherhood ... a brotherhood of righteous , crime fighting , skull cracking , disco boy bashing , warriors of the night !
i do n't want to worry your mama with company .
aw , come on . you 'll like her . she 's real nice . she 'll give us somethin ' if we ask her to . candy or somethin ' .
what ... what about your script ? so what 's it about ?
well , i 'd love it if you 'd read it , actually , 'cause i really would value your opinion .
stop it ! stop it ! jackie covers her ears and looks at him , pleading with her eyes . starks ' eyes plead right back .
i 'm sorry for upsetting you , [ beat ] but i 'm not lying to you .
dude - there 's not any chance of my becoming involved in this , is there ?
you ? no , you 'll be all right , so long as you establish an alibi for tonight .
but what makes you think there are n't more of those ... things ... back there ?
nothing ... you want to come , come ... you do n't ...
hey , ross . tell me something . does pg & e pay you to cover their ass , or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
i 'm not having a witch hunt here , mr. crawford ! our patients are decent , non-violent people with a real problem .
dr. danielson , the man we want was never your patient . it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence . please , doctor - time is eating us up . just show me the ones you 've turned away .
where 's my father ? have you even looked ?
yeah , uh , i got some pretty good leads ...
yes , i find that weasles have a special gift for the work . the rabbit did n't contact you by any chance , did he ?
why would he contact me ? i just took some lousy pictures .
oh , she 'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age .
it 's weird . chang , how old are you ?
i should have known ... once i would have ... i used to be wary ... and today i watched my son killed before my eyes ... your sister civilized me and i damn myself for having let her ...

hey , why do n't you just keep your room and we 'll put the baby in the back yard .
do n't do that , you 've got the whole garage .
your honor , i do n't see a mr. roston listed as a prosecution witness .
the state 's investigation just uncovered mr. roston yesterday afternoon in chicago .
well i do n't think there 's a chance of that happening . it 's usually the moon walks . sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher .
well i hope i do n't do anything careless .
boy , what 'd i tell you about using that word ?
`` ca n't '' should never be in a man 's vocabulary .
you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road ?
yeah ? first door on the right . it ai n't that dirty . just kinda ' filthy is all .
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you , then yes he does .

very well . assume this is true . assume they have only the best of intentions . suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us . you have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs ?
we 've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction . do you call it 'interventionist ' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck ?
to what ? what are you saying ? this ship is alive ?
i did n't say that , i said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you , the ship is reacting to us ...
that 's about an hour and a half longer than i usually spend looking for parts . you 're the one thinks that car 's so damn fancy . what you expect but fancy damn prices ?
that 's a ford , not a ferrari . you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford ?
in any case , you 've got to recover chimera and bring it to us .
in order to do that , i 've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it .

i 'm heading in to work , baby . are you sure you 'll be okay ?
you can be goddamn sure , though , i 'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when i get back to baltimore -- i get proof who stole my shit and i call the cops !

that scarecrow ? ca n't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him .
come on , shelly . who else is gon na give him a lift ?
i was your choice , dr. lecter . you chose to speak to me . would you prefer someone else now ? or perhaps you do n't think you can help us .
that is both impudent and untrue ... tell me , how did you feel when you viewed our billy 's latest effort ? or should i say , his `` next-to-latest '' ?
i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl .
i know . i know . you 've got the talent . i got the breaks .
i ca n't believe you called sam . what 's the matter with you ?
i 'm scared , that 's what . i 'm scared there 's no one to trust .
why worry about me ? you 're the one who says only look out for yourself .
okay , get in hot water . but do n't come hollerin ' to me when you get burned .
we do n't go around altering valuable paintings , dr. venkman .
well , i 'd make an exception in this case if i were you .
strong survival instinct . admire that in a woman .
you 're not leaving . not until we go back for the others .
i have to pick something up before bergdorf 's closes , then stop at a reception just a few blocks away .
i think , maybe , that is n't such a great idea ...

i 'm not going to get up an ' leave you . now let 's go over to el 's an ' have a good time .
that lunatic has been spouting off about jason since we boarded ... it 's no coincidence .

and you had sex with all of these men in cars ? only in cars ?

the gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine .
i certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one .

i ca n't lay that off in time . we lose a bet that big , it could break us .
if ya win it could make ya , too .
what if your father snapped ? your mom 's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree , killing everyone ...
except for me and billy ... we were left for dead ...

you devil , it 's mace , huh ? what 've you got here , a billy ? use it on poor unfortunate offenders .
really . you think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf ?
hmmm . i do believe bravo is showing spartacus on television tonight .
from before the beginning , young fellow . and now it 's after the end . anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
- we thought maybe , if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman .

out of the back of bondage magazines mostly , but you can find it on the street if you look . he 'll also do commissions , for enough money ...
nothing illegal , it 's always borderline . like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a ...
i said you can be too crude sometimes ? i do n't think i care for it .
sorry , sugar . go on and tell me how old pooch done the deed .
one , because i have a job here and two because i live here --

i only desire what gives you pleasure , my dearest .
will it be possible to have my dog , bijou , sent here ? i was not allowed to bring her and i love her so much .
ca n't get right ? that 's the kid 's name ? can i talk to him ?
you can try , but you wo n't get too far . why you interested ?
it 's complicated and i do n't want to go into it now , because it 's bound to sound insulting -- even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted . it 's just the truth .
i like the truth . i would n't be alive today if i were n't one of the biggest fans truth ever had .
i mean ... things . ted , joanna 's very unhappy and --
listen , joanna kramer 's got a goddamn good life . she 's got a husband that loves her . she 's got a terrific kid . she 's got a wonderful home --

but surely the emperor did n't mean to prohibit dancing when it 's part of the story .
it is dangerous for you to interpret his majesty 's edicts . give me your score , please .

that 's very refreshing . now what 's the password ?
i come to grandma 's funeral . here 's your admission card .
do you realize you 're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me ?
it 's different . he 's a man . and by the way you have no business calling him a homo .
summers are short here , annie . there is n't much of a fall . before you know it , the roads are closed ... the nights get long .
i do n't care ! we 'd be together .
how 'bout the score was his idea to begin with ?
his idea ? gim me a break . fuckin ' guy 's got a vacant lot for a head . was you and me figured the whole thing out .
yeah , fell down and hit a rock . not as bad as it looks .
there was a young fellow over at jamilla 's today when it got hit . way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers .
you could 've broke it to me gently , you know ; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend . i told you i have a girlfriend .
i know , i 'm sorry . but when we started talking ... it 's like i forgot i had a boyfriend . and then he proposed last month ...
you think he 's got a thing for you ?
maybe . but i 'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself .
listen , boy , it 's more than twenty days from here .
twenty days ! ? the world is that big ?
does she go up to the farren 's often ?
no . i only let her go with edward . it 's alright .
i 've taken vows to live my life within these walls ; not outside them .
abbe , i admire you ; i do . you 've a conviction ... an idealism ... peculiar to the very young . and so i 'll be candid . the ministry has sent me here with the most explicit ... the most severe instructions .
neil , do n't leave the back doors open -- i do n't want holly near the pool .
we 'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool .

the try t'wild out on my boo and it 's on and crackin ' ! i 'm layin ' niggas out .
major , what do you think could have done this ?

the time we were in a tree for fourteen days , you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs. wheeler .
i did n't even scratch the surface . you 're lucky , boy . you come home , and nobody 's here . when i go home , everybody 's going to be there .
he took him over . his body . his -- his brain , everything what he knew . he 's only been dumb stuff before amoeba -- things , and rhino -- things . he liked being human . did n't want to change .
and you said the worms are part of him . they 're all linked , like one creature ?
sure did . i 'll tell you , if that man was any better looking it 'd be a crime 'a some sort ...
yep . hey , i got a surprise for tonight . we 're going to the starlite in style !
i did n't . but it 's a three-way tie between the stooges , patti smith and the runaways .
yeah , i definitely need to make you some cds . at least while my kid is hanging out in there .
did you ever notice all the prices end in nine ? damn , that 's eerie .
you know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour ?
and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built .
oh , we did n't build it . the transit system has been in place for billions of years ; we 're just its ... caretakers .
george can drive us . there 's plenty of room in the car . jeff ?
no . you know what ? you guys go ahead and bring back something here . yeah .
he 's an artist . anyway , he 's too old to think about sex .
all the old men i know think about nothing but sex .
good . you conquer the demon , but your horse is sinking in the bog . what do you do ?
i go to bed and get a new horse in the morning .
listen to yourself . why would i do anything like what you 're describing ?
because you hate me . because you had to be here , when mom died . because you had to do it alone . well , do n't you think if i 'd known ... i'd 've been here too . i 'd have been here ...
shes no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant .
ah , i see . a purely ... plutonic relationship .
i do n't want to invite someone else , because this is the < u > most < /u > < u > exclusive < /u > ...
waal , then , you know , you do whatever would make you happy . sher . this is your party , and whatever ...
little chang is gon na have to go visit his daddy in jail if you do n't cooperate .

you know what , though ? i feel like i 'm really ready to do it . to have sex for the first time .
wow . that 's big . i mean sex is a really big deal . you should n't do it until you know you 've found the right person .
bad is bad , buddy . there ai n't no sense to it .
did they try to induce you to become a prostitute ?
we 're going to have to cover the entire lagoon .
i know , but you 're just going to have to find another way . so you better start .
you said that thing was big as your hand . i do n't think i 'm going to miss ...
why take the chance ? just let me go down there with you ...
ay me ! sad hours seem long . was that my father that went hence so fast ?
it was . what sadness lengthens romeo 's hours ?
yeah , but it did n't go so good . he was n't the man i thought he 'd be . theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup , but his hands are trembling , spilling some of the coffee .
my father used to say to me `` never ... '' no , hmmm . `` always ... '' no , no ... ah ! love and hate are blood relations .
well , he did . with his family . but his cousins , they had to stay and they were all killed . and if he 'd stayed , he would have been killed . so in my book he 's a survivor .
even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?
you mean like we do n't give a shit .
yeah . kinda . anyway , once i have the authentic sounds of speech , the rhythms , man , the patois , i can actually begin to think the way those guys do , get inside their heads .
it 's that hot rod joey , right ? that ' s who you want me to bend my rules for ?
he 's not a `` hot rod '' . whatever that is .

you 've certainly thought this out , have n't you ?
last friday . she left work , and home ... i was in tucson over the weekend ... i have n't heard from her , not even a phone call .
and you thought she 'd come up here , to me ? if she had , what reason would she have for not calling you ?
no , i did n't think she was . let me get the picture here . let me guess . she was an absolutely clean girl , a model daughter , she never had rebellious or impure thoughts , she did n't fuck around ...
if i was you , mr. mast , i 'd watch my language .
dr. chilton - if lecter feels you 're his enemy - as you 've said - then maybe i 'll have more luck by myself . what do you think ?
you might have suggested that in my office , and saved me the time .
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull .
we 've known debbie what , since the eighth grade ? how many years of foreplay is that ?
no ! ! ! what do you think i am , crazy ? ? ?
no , i just want to help myself , that 's all .
you mean you 'll tell us his name ? ? ?
it 's not a he , general . it was an article in the `` times '' about a year and a half ago .
why not ? i need to get in there !
i 'm not certain , my dear , but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route .
yeah . well . they 're a talkative buncha commentators .
you got a lot of people love you , starling .

look , you took one road and i took another . that 's fine .
she 's grown up some , has n't she ?
oh , jesus , lay off , will you ? it looks like you 've won this fucking round already , so lay off a little , for christ 's sake .

mike . we do n't have to watch it . come on .
dead or alive , they 'll stick me in there with oswald . another lunatic acting alone ,
oswald was an assassin . you 're not an assassin , are you , jerry ?
mostly . armored cars can be hijacked . trains can be derailed . but nobody can get to us in flight .
i have n't lost a bill in eighteen years , do n't jinx me , walt .
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office .
what can i tell you , louis ? after nam i did n't want to think anymore . i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos .
an enticing offer . but what does the lady want in return ?
let 's cool it for now . there 's someone i want you to meet .
that 's a nice piece of heat right there .
thank you . i only got two bullets in the mothafucka , but it 's better than nothing .
most unusual . an unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power . i find it illogical that its intentions are hostile ...
really ? you think this is its way of saying `` hi there '' to the people of the earth ?
they tell me you use narcotics . could i bring someone around to look at your arms ?

it 's fine . it was fun , though .
it must be weird for you to have so many sisters ?
i do n't know . my name is george .
i know who you are , el americano . mister george .
ginger , i 've been watching you all night . you 've been stealing from me .
do n't give me that shit . i want my money .

higher mathematics . two ounces to a drink -- three drinks , six ounces .

grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder .
let me make this clear ; if we stay , we die !
i do n't trust you . no way ! i pick who goes ! and i 'm holding you responsible .
when you say this funny feeling , you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you ?
that is correct , sir . and then all i can think about is like trying to snuff it .
that 's right . we 'd be proud to provide as escort for malcolm 's widow . how many men you got ?
get the brothers a beer . me too while you 're at it . men ? well we can spare six for security ...
i found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter . i gave my grief to jesus christ .

hey . you remember that nut in the hockey mask ? with the asthma ? what was his name . . .

what do you say we go get a suite at the carlyle ? caviar ? champagne ? celebrate , just like the old times sunshine .
those days are over , gordon . they were over a long time ago .
so , dr. venkman , please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street .
seventy-seventh and first avenue has so many holes already we did n't think anyone would notice .
... all right . i 'll meet you in the lobby . but only cause you 're paying me to .

i was just thinking how i could use a pair of pliers ... and i remembered where they are ...
that 's it . that 's it . breathe easy .
how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive ... ?
the prime directive does n't apply . these people are not indigenous to this world . they were never meant to be immortal . we 'll simply be restoring their natural evolution .
but you 've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press .
if i had , there would have been some evidence . they would have found something at the factory .
what ? < u > why < /u > ?
i am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise .
do you mean to say you 'd set it off in your own country ?
naturally . it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country . but this way we know it 's safe , and we do n't have the problem of delivering it .
i 'm talking about your people , not you .
what the fuck do you know about my people ?
the doctor can tell , but i decided not to know . i want it to be a big surprise .
well , it can really only go two ways .
you know what happened to the tower of babel , do n't you ? it fell down .

in my time they used to call me the merlin of berlin .
they probably meant irving and wanted you to swing .
they 're armed for bear , buckaroo . check out those radiation levels .
john parker , tell them we 're doing our best . stall .
okay . is there any way to duplicate that feeling ? some memory or ...
i 'm sure i can come up with something .
`` intervention ? '' what are you , god now ? !
of course not ! gods are n't afraid to die ! gods do n't die ! we do !
well , a plan < u > is < /u > forming ... a vicious one , involving the loss of innocent life ...
i want in . the thought of busting batman makes me feel all ... dirty . maybe i 'll give myself a bath right here ...
that 's not entirely true , will . it 's the way you think .
i think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way i think . i came down here to get away from all that .
no . absolutely , and we 're going to see that it is not .
so what i want to do is stop it here . i 'm going to make him an offer . i want to do it myself . i want it to come from me .
we 're the new pioneers , chaz . we even have our own special diseases .
come on -- let 's go above and see how they 're coming with the gear .
what do you have to do to get ready ?
load a new tape , turn the camera on .
nonsense . why do n't you listen to your children for a change ? you might actually learn something ?
for instance , how to run the affairs of government ? no doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me -- with the greatest ease !
he 's trying to get a foot hold in our territory .
he sticks his toes in the water again , we 'll cut 'em off .
oh , yes . absolutely . german . unquestionably !
so then you like it ? you really like it , your majesty ?
even a god that was n't active , that just created something and stood back and watched ?
you 're talking about a man in a white beard again . you 're ascribing human characteristics to something that is n't human . human beings look for causes and patterns . how could we know what solaris is up to , if anything ?
you was eyeballin ' , luke . you ca n't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin ' ...
boss , you do n't need reasons to hit me .
nobody 's loyalty is beyond question . besides , how do we know one of his staff did n't see it ?
come on , king . that does n't make sense .
so , i hear the tart from california shot heyworth .
well , that 's what we 're trying to prove did n't happen . do you have any reason to believe it did ?

it 's pretty embarrassing . i really do n't know what to tell mr. robinson . it 's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine .
next time he suggests it , i 'll tell him i have no intention of ever calling her up in my life .
no , i mean was it right away or in the night or when was it .
believe it was that night . she buried him the next mornin ' . diggin ' in that hard caliche .
my sister is dead , paul . they would not leave the children .
no . they are not dead . stop this .
no , i asked you to give me a refreshing drink . i was n't expecting a fucking rainforest ; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that .
you want a pint , go to the pub .
napoleon was born at ajaccio in corsica on august 15th , he had not been a healthy baby and his mother , letizia , lavished him with care and devotion . in middle age , he would write about her from st. helena .
my mother has always loved me . she would do anything for me .

let me get this straight . we drove all the way down to klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking ?
of course . jake . nice to see you .
well , it certainly is a coincidence . here of all places ! how is mrs. lewis ?
two drinks and i start swinging from the rooftops . look , i bore myself silly . let 's talk about you . how the hell did you wind up in corto maltese ?
that 's a tough one . have you ever seen combat ?
i 'll see him alone . everyone knows you 're my muscle . we 'll make it social . tell kross i 'll meet him for dinner . tonight if you can arrange it .
you should n't go alone . he might claim that you tried to black mail him .
she was running a little sluggish on the way back . think the turbines might be playing up .
give me twenty minutes and i 'll do it myself .
why do n't you arrest that man ? are you protecting him because policeman ?
listen , i 'm the cop that polices the police . i 'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops . i 'll make an arrest when i know everybody involved .
i fixed you up with diane troxler and she put out , did n't she ?
yeah , i had to give her free dermabrasion for a year . forget it , louis . i could get in a lot of trouble .
if he did n't you 'd never sit still while this was happening .
you sure ? maybe that 's the kind of friend i am .
i 'm only doing this to get out of my family 's hair ... .
one time i was flying supplies up the amazon . went down in the jungle ... .
well , i mean ... i do n't know you ... this has never ... i 've never won anything and ... i do n't have a vcr .
you get a vcr with the membership . ... for a short time until you get your own . listen , why do n't you come down to the store and you can check it out . see if you 're interested .
no , mickey , i ca n't let you get away with that shit . answer the question . was it worth it ? you have n't seen , heard , or smelled mallory in a year . was it worth it ?
was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie ? yeah , it was .
yeah , but your running away is n't going to help you with all this ...
there was blood everywhere , rosa . i saw it , i think i watched the whole thing happen ... oh my god ...
mr. yow ? oh mr. yow ... ? it looks like somebody is sitting in this car .
oh my ! oh my ... maybe you better come out now , miss starling .
just do n't worry about it . how we doin ' timewise ?
not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull .
he asked to go home early . he said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do .
tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and mr. viznick .
wait . you mean there 's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic ?
grow up , johnny . you want to run around < u > on fire < /u > for the rest of your life ?
well , do n't be daft , i 've got to .
and i take a left-handed view of life , i 've got to .
i did n't mean that as a slur on your manhood . i 'm sorry .
that 's all right . maybe she could have fooled me . but ... she did n't fool my mother .
sure there are -- and i 've tried them all . plays , love stories , westerns , dog stories . huh , now there was a good one , that dog story all about --
but horror stories ! why all the time horror stories ?
he 's not with us , xander . he must be with you .
bullshit ! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i 'm gon na give you another hole to breathe out of .
i 'm telling you you 're messing up the story , now get it right !
do you want me to go on with this ?
well , if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why could n't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats ?
because ... he wanted to them to be punished .
ten ? no . i remember this case . three . he killed three women .
what 're you talking ' ? you know better than anybody , john . you 've read this file a thousand times .
a little ... you think it 's the same for jacques ?
no . jacques is a creature of the sea . he is n't meant to live on earth , among us ... you should know this , johana .
going back to la . maybe i can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the swedish bikini team . no more navy blue suits . no more panty- hose . no more trying to be something i 'm not .

i 'm sorry . i have n't even got any cigarettes left !
i 'll make some for you ! you will come today ?

well ... well , how soon would you want them ?
immediately . is this the daily news ? melanie daniels . would you get me the city desk , please ?
do you really think your mighty federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people ?
the `` mighty '' federation could learn a few things from this village ...
i was goin ' to the secret place . i borried one of your books to take down there . you ai n't mad , are you ?
naw . you can look at all my books you want to .

i 'm pretty happy to see me too . so are you done with me yet ?
l.t. , in this office i 'd prefer you say italian-americans .
i 'm sorry , mr. dean . but larry 's in st. lukes now , so i 'm a little -- i 'm not myself . the union bosses say unless we take bellmoth 's offer , it 'll only get worse .
no , i was saying crazy like a lunatic .
i know that now . he 's a fucking psycho .
do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter ?

i quit , eddie . i ca n't beat you . willie , give him the stakes . you got yourself a pool player .
preacher , gim me my coat , will ya ?
yes , you 've got to get me out of here . i 've got to find her .
i understand , sam , i know exactly how you feel . so i brought you a bottle of barley water .
no , we do n't . their committees have informed me that they 're unwilling to take mr. merrick , even if they were supplied with funds . they do n't want him .
well , it 's up to us then , is n't it ?
do you remember when we met at the bar ? ... you were wearing a tuxedo .
but the first time i saw you was in the elevator .
oh well -- you 've got to do them .
why ? why have you got to go round killing and looting ?
yeah , maybe you 're right . everything else is just an excuse . i 'm treating the situation with kid gloves because i 'm afraid of losing her .
< u > ask < /u > her how she feels .
thanks , but i 'm here on business . i heard you 're the g around here . i 'm looking for some cars , expensive ones . a lot of them .
sorry , man , do n't know what you 're talking about .

what was that ? i 'm sorry , i did n't catch it . would you repeat it ?
why do i ? -- i come in here -- instinctively -- first thing i do -- i 'm looking for the exit -- i 'm catching the sightlines -- i know i ca n't sit with my back to the door --
you 're paranoid . you were shot . it 's natural .
`` that 's not just a ford , that 's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang . ''
what 's that got to do with the radiator hose ?
do n't worry , i 've got a permit for it .
jesus christ dewey help me ! they tried to kill me in the bathroom ! the killers !
you told me that about the < u > last < /u > town .
yeah , but they never made a movie here .

yes , but you , you do care about me .
all that marching -- tramp , tramp , tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe ?
i 'm sorry , mrs. lieberman -- and i 'll never invite those people again .
m'lady ... if anyone sees , it is death ...
if i do n't kiss you , i die anyway .

would you like a cup of tea , billy ? there 's a piece of cake left .
forget it . the vienna boys choir could n't get through this stuff .
good effort . now what ? should we say supportive , nurturing things to it , ray ?
so where the hell am i going to sleep ?
if you 're looking at me , look elsewhere .
we think he might be making a reference to drugs ? miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine .
could emma be the name of the girl he 's going to kill ?
randal , twelve minutes is not a game ! jesus , it 's barely a warm-up !
bitch , bitch , bitch . you want something to drink ?
it was jamie lloyd . she came back , as i knew she would one day . and whatever has brought her back has brought michael back as well .
after six years ? sam , she died with him in that explosion after the --
jerry , you 're simply going to have to trust me . i 've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you 're jeopardizing everything .
your 'foolproof ' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you 're basking in rio .
fuck you , fuck pizza , and fuck frank sinatra , too .
well , fuck you , too , and fuck michael jordan .
well -- that 's the last time -- we 'll have servants to do it .
no , no . i do n't want to be idle .
he was the driver , dignan . he did what he 's supposed to do .
i did n't realize you were so sensitive to bob 's feelings . considering i did the plans , you 're actually lucky you got --
did you intend to kill him ? just answer me that .
was it a sudden quarrel ? had there been any trouble between you before ?
he 's telling the truth ! are n't you , michael ?
to free you , we must destroy the leader of the vampires .
that 's what i want to find out . we have to get help .
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night ?
we 've already been over the terrain twice . nothing .
there was a hurricane , bill , the wind probably moved it .
well , david moved out here and started his residency . then he met leslie --
no , no , no . we know all that . what happened with you ?
what makes you think ... you 'll make ... squad leader , rico ?
something ... i 've got ... you do n't .
go ! we follow thee . juliet , blah !
go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
i ai n't done arranging your flowers , egghead .
ben . this is serious . < u > turn around < /u > .
i 'm not gon na mention ricky to him .
do n't expect you to mention it to him . i 'm just saying , if --
yeah , but you said you 've never met him . how did you --
honey , i do n't like to talk about this stuff in front of eric .
what ? this is a good level , is n't it ?
how can i look at you and say this ?
was that you ? i remember that . i was only three or four , but i always heard about it growin ' up . they say you 're well ?
yes ma'am . i like your garage . i would n't never hurt you or your boy . i 'd lay my hand on the bible and say the same thing .
we 're not allowed to tell a dirty joke hail , hail , freedonia
if chewing gum is chewed , the chewer is pursued and in the hoosegow hidden ...
did you ever have a roll in the hay ?
i 'm not sure i ... get your drift .
i am sir lancelot of the lake , from across the sea . i am the best knight in the whole of christiandom , and i look for the king who is worthy of my sword 's service .
-- that is a wild boast . you lack a knight 's humility .
she told me you were a ghost in her life . daddy the friendly ghost . coming back to haunt her .
well , she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy was n't in the royal marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of borneo or playing iago in a worldwide tour of othello .
well . i think you 're painting the picture a little darker than it is , really . if nothing else - and do n't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in addison .
he 's not my friend . you were my friends ...
no one would have thought it of me . i 've been getting rusty in fredersdorf . well , if bluff is what the world wants i guess i can put up as big a bluff as anyone . from now on ...
you must go to manchester at once yourself and really see it through .
dumont ! where 's yori ? where 's flynn ?
they may be ... de-rezzed ... on the carrier ... hurry ...
what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern , real estate --
laundromats for the washing of money . unfortunately , carl had only one successful business .
... i just made a call about that . it 'll look fine .
i must 've gone money simple . this kind of murder ...
a hundred-seven bucks too much . any kid who drops an extra dime is gon na be talkin ' to moliari .
ya mean we 're so rich we 're broke ?
yeah . she was the one called joanne . how 'd you find that out ?
just a guess . did you have it good with your wife ? you know , sex .
you 're not resting well , are you ? i know -- it 's that music . you need your sleep . is there anything else you want ?

alpha , my sensors tell me the rangers were too late ! ivan is on his way here !
hey , nobody enters the command center without a power coin !
we 'll match your rate just prior to your ... accident . one half in advance .
who 's running the show , armitage ? this a government sting ?
actually , no , i 've changed my mind . i should n't have called .
well , i 'm here now . i 'd like to do something ...
god , daniel , i 'm not going to make agent orange .
you think the chemists that invented agent orange twenty years ago were in school saying , 'boy , i really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant . ' you think oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war ?
the mask is because you think it might be ... catching ?
i do n't know . i 've been back and forth with narragansett naval all day , consulting with the best people in maritime medicine , the best people in viruses ...
i bought a beer . that was two- fifty . i bought a beer , otherwise i would have thirty .
i 'm sorry , sir . it 's thirty dollars for the ticket .
i just have this feeling everything 's totally safe .
i see blood . maybe you got him , hank .
`` this is miss vale . '' -- that felt redundant .
you 're just back from corto maltese . i saw your combat photos . quite a departure for you .
jim feingold , v.p. , e.d.a . engineering and data analysis .
i 'm not quite sure how this works . my brother ...
oh ... i see . i understand . how is ... the emperor ?
i rarely see him , your highness , but i believe he is in excellent health , and he is very happy with the child .
mr. gandhi , i 've more or less decided to ask the house to repeal the act that you have taken such `` exception '' to .
well , if you ask , general smuts , i 'm sure it will be done .
that ring 's so great . the green one .
tom , i love you ! see ! i bought it for him , for his birthday .
i never read that . that was-that was henry james , right ? novel , uh , the sequel to turn of the screw ? my sexual ...
it 's the influence of television . yeah , now marshall mcluhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high , uh , high intensity , you understand ? a hot medium ... as opposed to a ...
it 's a hell of a lot of money .
what , you think there 's something funny about it ?
you idiot . you almost gave me a massive coronary .
i did n't mean to scare you like that .
uh , right ... and that was it . that 's when we decided to start our own business . no more shithead bosses .
i envy you guys . taking a chance like that .
swarthout . yes . he 's the man who sold us the ranch in --
wrong . he sold you $ 3,000 worth of scrub brush .
y'call that art ? why , my three-year-old can paint better than that .
like you 'd know . you started out on the back of a napkin , you little ... < u > doodle < /u > .
this is it . a golden opportunity . patrick can ask katarina to the party .
in that case , we 'll need to make it a school-wide blow out .
if it 's about the posters , i think it 's so awful . it 's a travesty .
a travesty . huh . that 's interesting , because i think you did it .
what 's peggy sue going to do at your lodge meeting ?
it 's her 18th birthday , i want to show her off .
w-well , please be candid . i , i-i do n't want you to feel bad .
yes ! but i ... i have certain feelings for you , but do n't make me say anything more , all right ?
yes , sir , it 's here on the truck , but it 's pretty heavy -- i 'll need help .
otto ! you and one of those other fellows ! come help professor darcey .
sure she is . that 's why she got an unlisted number and you have n't heard squat from her in a dozen years . oh you 're good , ted . you 're a real piece of work .
look , let 's forget it . let 's forget the whole thing .
ah , begging your pardon , but should n't we be going ?
after all , you rode us night and day to win that bet .
they stop the construction work at six or seven . the parking lot 's mostly clear by two or three in the morning . even the early geeks do n't get there before five .
is it two ? or is it three ? have you ever really noticed ?
... oh , who would jack your fuckin k- car ? he 's right , sue . you do n't need no gat .
listen . just because i was the only one with the balls to stand up to them ...
i - i guess they tried to , but they bent their stingers .
oh , dear . i do n't know what i 'd do if a whole swarm kept -- oh ! oh ! oh , there 's one on me !
you know , i-i-i do n't think many couples could handle this . you know , they could just break up and remain friends .
hey , this one 's mine , this button . this one , you rem-
that wo n't help you ! you ca n't intimidate us !
soviet russia will put all its might behind this case .
i must go where i can be of use .
but -- there 's so much more to do right here . and look , if it 's about me , i mean , i 'm gone .
i do n't think i can go on , sir .
what the devil do you mean ? you have your lodgings , a certain stipend -- i thought i had arranged everything for you --
might i ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
there was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs .
i 'm rambo . this is brewer . her name is co .
it means `` virgin . '' my mother was comedian .
you have taken over his offices , is that not so ?
it is only temporary , until my confirmation by ...
but why did i do it ? what was this all for ? so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort ? or so i could become famous ?
frederick , just what is it that you are saying ?
it 's all right . i 'll forward your mail .
no , really , i am sorry , sorry to be ducking out on you like this . i hope you wo n't take it personally .
no i 'm not . i look like shit . and so do you , ruby . you look just awful . what 's with the patch , anyway ? what 'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin ?
i do n't want to talk about it . if you really want to know . i lost it . and i 'm not sorry i did . that eye was cursed , auggie , and it never gave me nothing but grief .
i hope that 's not supposed to impress me .
are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you ?
oh , no - it 's too delicious ! you 're making it up !
on my word ! that 's what they believe .
i -- i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise --
eloise does n't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check , kicks .
we wo n't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit .
we will . you samoans are all the same . you have no faith in the essential decency of the white man 's culture .
so are you . i mean you 're a neat guy . we better get back .
i guess so . you want to help me watch frank ? . i 'm going to stake out frank 's place tomorrow . with a camera .
are all the yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed , lieutenant ?
not anxious to die , sir , anxious to matter .
my ass . i told 'em . listen to this : i said ...
hey , i do n't want to hear your fucking war stories ...
i 'm glad you let me talk to you . you used to not let me talk to you .
go away . i am not talking to you .
i will , dear . i promise . why mcdonald 's ?
he 's been looking everywhere for weeks , mom . it 's not that easy after you 've been locked away .
i feel as if i 've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon . could you teach me to do that ?
i did n't think to see you again tonight . you were pretty pissed .
what are you going to do , cooper , throw yourself on a bunsen burner ? it 's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab . we 'll be out in no time .
i got ta keep you alive -- it 's in my contract .
what if he hears something he 's not supposed to ?
well , we do n't let that happen , now do we ?
-- and call my family , i 'd like them to come over for dinner tonight .
did n't the family get together last night -- ?
eight scientists . eight different fields of endeavor . hydraulics , optics , ballistics ...
put them all together and what do we have ?
how do you know so much about this junk , plato ?
i had to go to a head-shrinker . i only went twice though . my mother said it cost too much , so she went to hawaii instead .
yeah . could be . go say hello , romeo . looks like a healthy non-mutant to me .
okay . all right . and what do i say ?
congratulations on the deal . how exciting . is sally doing sally ? i mean it 's sally . the character that 's based on sally . the character that 's based on sally in the book .
the novel . no , skye davidson is playing the lead .
i told him we might not need it , if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property .
pops put big daddy 's farm in rhonda 's and sunny 's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it .
i star-sixty-nined you . i never pick up my phone . what 's up ?
well ... let me see ... here 's the thing ...
i 'm so hungry i could faint . i 've -- i 've gotten your suit all wet .
that 's all right -- it 's a drip-dry .
the don was slipping ; in the old days i could never have gotten to him . now he 's dead , nothing can bring him back . talk to sonny , talk to the caporegimes , clemenza and tessio ... it 's good business .
even sonny wo n't be able to call off luca brasi .
hey , man , is babe ruth in the lineup today ?
of course , he 's in the lineup . there he goes right there . hey , babe ... !
a southern gentlemen . i do n't recall his name . i suppose it 's unkind of me to say it , but he had the most disconcerting glass eye .
a glass eye ? that 's who it was ! one-eyed jack garrison . otherwise known as general garrison , confederate third army . i saw him at dr. loveless ' party , but i could n't place him . he used to wear an eye-patch .
i believe that to be an accurate description of the events , sir ... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which ...
well , mister beauchamp , i was at the blue bottle saloon in wichita the night english bob killed corky corcoran ... an ' i did n't see you there ... nor no woman , nor no twogun shooters nor nothin ' like that .
in america they 'd bring only a penny . i guess that 's about all they 're worth .
i 'm willing to be overcharged . tell me .
you 're going to stay in school . do you understand ?
why ? so i can wind up like you ? what 's the point ?
he 's a sense/net chairman . why would he launch an a.i . ?
good question . he may not have intended to . the girl in question is lady 3jane . she 's very important to us . the third clone of lady jane tessier .
you could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars .
you 're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff .
that 's a franklin mint piece . eight dollars .
eight dollars ? ! franklin mint or not , it 's damaged goods !
shit ! you bought enough pate for a fucking army !
so tell me , exactly which truck driver did you study english with ?
cookie , they are dead , dead , deadski .
of course they 're dead . they 're ghosts .
you come in here at least three times a day . you a retard ? a buck fifty .
damn , sal , put some more cheese on that motherfucker .
that 's the whole point . it 's all in my head ; it 's right here . i just got to get it out there . tracy wants me to write it so she can read it . it 's beautiful .
dave , i 'm just saying this as your friend . what you 're doing is really , really wrong , and you 've got to stop .
i do ... christ , what happened to us ?
speak for yourself , boss i do n't have a hollandaise sauce
well , i think it 's important for people to know that the world is in danger .
okay , so can you tell us when it 's going to happen or do we have to buy the book ?
a car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road .
i 'd love to . if you 're sure it 's alright ?
me . this endless ... blonde babble . i 'm like , boring myself .
thank god ! if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure ...
oh , marvellous . it 's the first real sleep i 've had for the past two days .
there 's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest .
a big family must be fun ... i imagine it makes you feel you belong to something .
it does ... maybe that 's why i feel kind of lost right now .
that 's my point . remember , you 're a cop pretending to be a deviant . it 's not the other way around .
do n't confuse what we do with who we are .
i have no doubt that you 're a good dad . you can tell a lot from a person 's voice . but something must be missing if jonah feels that you 're still under a cloud .
tell her how you do n't sleep at night .
i love a macho façade . it 's such a turn-on . what smells like shoe polish ?
and you came here to what ? to comfort me ?
is that where they say it came from ... ?
no , they say it came from the waste paper basket !
are n't you supposed to be buried in new york someplace ?
yeah . your parents came to my funeral . i was surprised at how many people came .
the first time can be awkward . you just have to get on and try again .
i do n't even know if i should be doing this . it 's a very expensive car .
remember me ? i 'm the fellow you slept on last night .
seems to me i 've already thanked you for that . what time is the next bus to new york ?
so you , like , come from a town like this or ... ?
no , not really . i come from an `` area '' . bel air .
nell ... please , nell ... take a deep breath ...
and they 're all locked together in here ... and he wo n't let go of them !
he probably does n't make much money picking apples -- he must have had to pay to send them , too .
i would n't worry , edna , that he does n't have money . if he gets hungry , he can pick his dinner !
do n't be silly . can i get you something ?
no , thank you . just keep me company for a while .
did you want to see her about something important ?
yeah . i , uh , well . . . no . it 'll wait . say , he 's a nice man , is n't he ? mr. norton , i mean . he 's , er , he 's done an awful lot for the
then why the hell do we watch all the time ?
because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how america does n't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny tv celebrity because that would just mean that i 'm not really talented .
that do n't sound like you , ma . you never was like that before .
i never had my house pushed over before . i never had my fambly stuck out on the road . i never had to lose ... ever'thing i had in life .
i 've got a hunch you 're going to win that bet , inspector .
i hope so . well , i guess you two can do without me . i 'll be seeing you .
john , it 's not your problem what she eats .
the woman 's surrounded by fools ! she has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning . knowing that lot , they 'll still be dressing her at eight .
i 'd be happy too , if i had such a great family .
do n't worry . you just have n't met right woman yet . oopsy . that cabbage goes right through me .
well , as you know , most of my staff have weighed in against this `` incursion . '' they believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily , and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
i did n't ask what your staff thinks , henry . what do you think ?
mr. sulu , take the con . i 'm taking our guest down to see her whales . mr. spock : have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program ?
mr. scott can not give me exact figures , admiral . so i will ... make a < u > guess < /u > .
i 'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore .
that 's a horrible ugly comment . `` dead whore ? '' she 's a person !
that is not an `` option . '' there is no multiple choice here .
yes sir , there sure is an option here . there are always options .
that only proves my point more . the word is a badge for her failures at school .
you 're probably right ... '' people think just because you 're beautiful and popular , life is easy and fun . nobody understood i had feelings too . ''
what kind of trouble are you in , jerry ?
well , that 's , that 's , i 'm not go inta , inta - see , i just need money . now , her dad 's real wealthy -
i was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry , i 'll be completely out of her life in a few days .
she understands what you 're going through and she really wants to help you . she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it .
that 's fine , oswald . but to get the mayor recalled , we still need a catalyst , a trigger , an incident . like the reichstag fire , the gulf of tonkin .
`` you 're doin ' great , mayor cobblepot . '' `` your table is ready , mayor cobblepot . '' `` i need you , oswald . i need you now . that 's the biggest parasol i ever -- ''
jim ... you are my best officer and if i had a best friend , you 'd be that too . but i am commander , starfleet , so i do n't break rules !
do n't quote rules , harry ! we 're talking about loyalty . and sacrifice . one man who died for us , another who has deep emotional damage --
please , gwen . you're- you 're all over me .
how do you think you got this job , cock ? mmm . i 'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim .
your ruse . your cunning attempt to trick me .
i only pointed out that you were n't paying any attention to what i was saying .
honey . nothing 's impossible . you just do n't shoot someone like that for no reason . maybe he was askin ' for it . anyway , somebody 's husband probably got ol ' harlan .
that 's what everybody says . only problem is nobody 's husband was unaccounted for that night ... could you shoot eddie in the face ? at point blank range ?
is that why you did n't write anything else ?
i did n't write anything else 'cause nobody , including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one .
so tell me ... am i still an angel ?
with wings . you transport me , you know that ? you carry me away .
that 's not me . i did n't ... i 'm not doing that .
someone is out there ... ... help , we 're in here !
you 're full of interesting facts , are n't you ?
it was may , , near gibsland , louisiana .
this is a club , sheriff -- you been in here --
and people better clear out of here ! now !
alfredo , damn him ! he cast his spell on you too !
i told him i 'd take his advice . but before i went away i left you that note ... i was on my way down the stairs ...
no ! do not be sorry ! never be sorry ! the king cares for nothing and for no one ! there are no mistakes when you are king ! what you do is right for every person ! a king has contempt for everyone !
is that the king of king you wish me to be ? or do you say this because of your son ?
i 'm putting liquor in the drinks , i 'm giving 10-times odds on craps , i got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin ! show me another buffet 's gon na offer you coke and pepsi ! whaddya want me to do ? !
we want to see our casino making money again , mr. bangs . making money for our community .
these freaks , trevor , they give me the creeps . and i 'm not the only one . you 're up for review . you and your petting zoo .
i know where to find him . i 'll get him back .
what is that ? what are you doing with your hands ? talk to me , you 're talking like that girl sheila .
do n't be mean , this is hard for me too .
where 'd he say he was going to do this ?
he did n't . that 's your job . i 'm taking you off that other case until you 've nabbed this lunatic . good luck . nice train . but mine 's nicer .
jesus christ , walsh . that 's what you spent your day doing ?
look , you tell me to take pictures , i take pictures .
alright , i 'll stay . judge , i want to ...
where you been ? i saw the cops rousting you at the rally .
the three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named leo .
lem me see if i got this right , you break into karen flores ' house , ask me for three hundred grand , does n't even belong to you ?
my recommendation : do me . do n't take the chance that i 'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass . ghost me , riddick . would if i were you .
if you were me , i 'd kill us both . c'mon , you wan na sit at the grown-up table or not ?
i 'm sure that 's true for some of them .
i thought i was the pro . these women make me feel like an amateur .
go to the opposite end of the island , and signal the ship . i 'll keep 'em busy .
are you sure ? jack -- this is not something you have to do .
we 're going to draw a little bit of everybody 's blood .
what are you going to do ? drink it ?
years ago , i worked for the c.i.a . in the m.k . ultra program . are you familiar with it ?
it was mind control . < u > manchurian < /u > < u > candidate < /u > kind of stuff , right ?
if it was a quarrel , how come you had the gun right there ?
this guy -- where did you meet him for the first time ? where did he come from ? who is he ?
what are you gon na do now if you do n't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more ?
i guess we 'll just have to evolve too .
well i 'm done talking to you , what do i have to do , draw you a diagram !
i decided to make a female figure after all ! i want you to pose for it .
you 're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend ! i do n't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns !
that 's not gon na happen . i 'm gon na create reasonable doubt . buckle your seatbelt and watch me work .
like i 've told you before i do n't want you taking care of me .
someone has to take care of you right now , michael . you tore up the apartment . you stopped taking your medications .
he 's just laying in bed . he 's pretty upset . he wo n't talk .
he 's dealing with a lot of things . i think he needs to find answers himself .
according to your statement you are a short-con operator . run of the mill seams . everything you do , you learned from somebody else .
that 's been suppressed . anything in there is inadmissible .
if we have a man dying in there , we 'll have to go in .
they have security cameras . rooney would see you coming .
at 7:30 sunday morning ? it 's not exactly fresh blood we 're sniffing here , boss .
old stains , bill , but just as telling .
yeah , you 're in luck there 's two of them , the other 's in there .
later mate , right now i 've got to do the locks on these doors so we do n't have to climb through that bloody window every time .
i 'll shout to my heart 's content ! i 'll scream if i want to .
ah ! coconut layer cake . nice and gooey , too . just the way i like it .
stand by , sir . miracle worker at work ...
mr. scott , do n't make jokes , we are in danger of -
' ... i do n't know if i can make it . ' that 's what i said . but i did n't leave .
no , she threw you out . what a difficult woman .
two days ago , would you have even hit me ? let alone so powerfully ?
no ... i guess i would have gotten jeffrey to hit you .
and finally , they 're not human beings , you know . their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
i do n't know about you , but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence . i mean whales may not have painted the mona lisa or invented the dirt bike but they did n't ravish the land either .
hey , teach , how 'd you get so smart ?
when you live in the basement of the school , you breathe in a lot of chalk dust . it writes out all the answers on your brain . now how about a slushee ?
he 's dead ? am i bad luck or what ?
there you go , blaming yourself for everything again .
sounds like a good reason to leave it alone .
just think though , it would make a hell of a cafe , that way we keep the auditorium clear .
i 've spent eighty years looking for another way , captain . this is the only one . of course , you could always come with me . you fancy yourself an explorer . here 's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced .
not if it means killing over two hundred million people . i wonder , did your wife leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder ?
you 're not supposed to like it . what gets me is your attitude . listen ... tomorrow you show up .
what about your attitude ... where 's your job ... eh ? you talk and talk and i go to work ... what do you do ?
what , we 're gon na pry 'em out with paddles ?
o'neil . our air 's gon na crap out as soon as we get down there . you know that , do n't you ?
maybe that 's why you ca n't catch him . i < u > know < /u > what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer .
i just came from her ... here 's what you have n't seen .
< i > mixed up ? < /i > mixed up in what ?
there 's no point in trying to explain it , but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that do n't go anywhere , people talking about me on the radio , you know what i mean ?
-- i have something to tell you . i have to tell you something . i want to change his will , can i change his will ? ... i need to -- -
you ca n't change his will . only earl can change his will .
that 's too bad . i got a half million shares . my whole foundation ! and now look at me !
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you , the swindler of thousands of people
really , marietta , you got more scenarios swimmin ' around in your brain than carter got pills . try to take it easy . go over to myrtle beach for a few days .
i 'm stayin ' right here by the phone until you find lula , then i 'm comin ' to get her . you call soon 's you got somethin ' , even if it 's three in the a.m .
well , you went to sarah lawrence for one thing .
those are sarah lawrence guys , patrick . you 're making me feel weird .
pham van do n't get his mitts on < u > this < /u > for no measly fifteen bucks !
you got < u > that < /u > right !
not once ? - you did n't hit it once ? -
-i would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
i do n't know . there 's a small community of us . we have a place they do n't know about . we 're happy . we 'll keep trying to figure out a way . come stay with us . join the struggle .
you 'll have me , after all i 've done to you ?
i 've never been in an apartment above a store . you always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them .
can i get you anything ... coffee ... tea ... a little tequilla ?
ethan , you take care of yourself , i 'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove , i 'm gon na bail - and without giving two week notice .
well , forewarned is forearmed . and while we 're at it , be especially sensitive to any sudden change in ambrose 's plans , especially any involving you..
you know , `` some '' . the fag stuff .
harry and i have been talking about school . in fact , i want to ask you something .
it 's what we 're here for , ai n't it ?
i thought we were trying to get the girls back -- < u > alive < /u > ... we jump those comanches , they 'll kill 'em ... you know that !
my mother 's buying me a new car for college .
huh . right . college . wow . where are you going ? where 'd you get into ?
well , he has been pushing me to meet his father , but i 've been putting it off .
it 's worth a shot . i can arrange a controlled meeting . a careful dose of sedatives for jason , some security , you and i monitoring . evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck , no more missing father complex .
but what good is a vow if everything gets blown away ? what good was my letter ?
i 'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world . i promise you . for it is they , and not i , that represent the people of earth .
the proof had his throat slit . so far you 're not denying it .
i 'm not going to dignify youwith answers . if you 'll excuse me , i 've got a jack vincennes press conference to prepare for .
okay . i 'm delighted to have someone to talk to , and you 're very cute , so i 'm very flattered , but i 'm also very married so you may as well forget -- you are trying to hit on me , are n't you ?
i 'm such a heel . how 'd you guess ?
i went on the internet and found this article about you ... it says you 're a horse whisperer , that you ... you help people with horse problems . and you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
well , see , truth is , ma'am , i help horses with people 's problems .
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined !
something to make the angels weep , and the saints to gasp for air ...
whoa , check this out . she looks like you .
wow , she 's beautiful . you really think she looks like me ?
now wait . we all had the same option as blake . it was work for the government or do time .
fine , but the civil terrorism unit ? it 's a fucking gestapo ! dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
it was nothing to do with you , sir .
well , ben , it was quite a bit to do with me .
-- nothing i can do about it unless you 're suggesting i infringe on their civil liberties -- which i 'd happily do if you 'll just trim a little fat off the constitution .
are you truly mouthin ' off to a senior member of the senate arms committee ? i mean , i 'll give you points for style -- just nothin ' for smarts .
you 're lying ! you 'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything ! you 'll be killed the moment you 're seen !
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them ? !
i do n't mean to be rude , but ...
just gettin ' a jolt of java before headin ' on home ? how does your wife feel about it ?
the bible only says do n't seethe a kid in its mother 's milk . but chickens do n't give milk .
look , you want cheese , go someplace else .
she 's very sweet , but so old- fashioned . please sit down , harold . i 'll put on the kettle and we 'll have a nice hot cup of tea .
thank you , but i really have to go .
nothing special , just a spoke in the wheel .
you talk in rhymes and riddles and ra ... rub-adub -- - but that does n't mean anything to me , see ... .see ... see i used to be smart ... .i 'm quiz kid donnie smith . i 'm quiz kid donnie smith from the tv --
it 's hers . where 'd you find him , robbing a bank ?
he was throwing snowballs at baron rothschild . we do n't know each other , do we ?
is n't it a fact that the `` six other asian men '' in the line-up were all of the classic mongoloid type , whereas shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a korean ?
objection . the witness is not an expert in racial classification .
bud , i hate to tell you this but you 're a genius ! darien ... lightning has struck ! the lightbulb has been invented . edison , da vinci , einstein are watching ...
... are you going to trade all night again ? you got to go to work in a couple of hours .
youse a pig man . i hope manny get dat laundry gig for ' you do .
de fool think he 's gon na get it but he ai n't known for his thinking .
heavy third world connections . they get weapons , drugs , fuel , choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south .
some areas have power - they 're on line to san onofre .
i said i 'll take care of it . now , a man of your position should n't be a part of what 's about to go down . so go home and i 'll call you tomorrow .
what , 'long distance ? ' i could n't help but hear you say something about rio , alan . you 're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars i staked you for the next load , are you ?
so have i , actually ... i wish it could always be like this .
see me around to my car , marty , and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long .
fairlane , you gon na find out who killed the lead singer of black vomit ?
tell me , dr. watson , what makes you think he 's not just another piece of shit overdose .
fuck yeah . whole package 'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower .
and you 'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change .
are you running a high fever , man ? how could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed ? how could you even conceive of it ?
i did n't conceive of it for the lions- i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger .
i ... i do n't know . i guess ... when people think you 're dying , they really listen , instead ...
-- instead of just waiting for their turn to speak .
you demand to be served . a fork fetishist .
it 's just fuel to me . i 'm not there for distractions .
not revealing information does n't necessarily make someone a liar .
that 's not the point . in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you do n't .
what ? now . st. peter 's church , and peter too , he shall not make me there a joyful bride !
here comes your father , tell him so yourself .
you must bow down to the almighty bunghole . heh heh , this is cool . bungholio-o-o-o-o-o !
he 's jerkin ' us off . i think we 're gon na have to take him out . get ready to fire on my orders ... this is your last chance . give us the unit now ...
there 's an understatement . there are dead people on better form .
but i wish to make it clear i 've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy .
at pennycuik . i know the inn . i can be there in an hour .
and back with macfarlane and all that he stands for the next day .
now hold on . there 's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sure it is .
bob , how long has wes been working on this script ?
i do n't know . a couple months . why ?
and listen , i 'll be right back and i want your ass in that bed when i get back .
you 're very rude ... if you do n't come back --
no . a chromium alloy tipped caliber bullet bounced off that thing 's skull like a spit ball . i think it was bothered by my light .
that would fit . it 's nocturnal . quick . come inside .
i do n't know ! shit ! let 's just play it by ear . he may not know . he may just give me a ticket .
please , god , please do n't let us get caught . please , please , please ...
dad , you have to teach me to suture this weekend .
okay , i promise i will . just come here a minute , i want to show you something .
and if you liked the person , you 'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight , would n't you ?
sure i would -- but i do n't get what you 're driving at .
i ca n't believe this is happening . i 'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour .
okay , just calm down . it 's going to be okay .
today at lunch , you asked me if i had any questions .
ah ha . you finally want to know about women .
not until you promise to act like a sensible human being .
i 'll do it again , i 'll do it again , i 'll do it again !
rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed . i hope she 'll be all right , but i still think we ought to fire her .
i do n't see how you can even think of it now .
you might want to tape your nipples down next time . it 's really distracting .
i ca n't help it . my bra would n't even fit . i 've been going to victoria 's secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still i 'm busting out . it 's this pms .
come on now ... you ca n't sit here .
no ! i want a debutante on a horse to step on me . leave me alone ! !
senator paine , if i could do just that one thing while i 'm here , i -- i 'd feel that i --
what 's to stop you ? saunders will help you with it --
excellent . we shall present them , along with the other particulars of the case to the committee . i want them to see , exactly , how horribly his body has been affected . you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities .
do you think they 'll go along with us ?
they perpetuate mechanical living , sir . they limit your mind .
mr. overstreet , i suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits . do you understand ?
one in each ear . what would you do without me ?
probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work ...
oh , things are n't so bad . gee , i hope you 're not goin ' to get in any trouble .
it was just a thing . the story made you laugh .
likes to kill ? knox women find him magnetic .
i bet they like him for his big charity balls .
so now you 've got to talk him out of it . and then we 've got to figure out an acceptable political solution .
and if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution ?
i ... i 'm leaving ... i ca n't take anymore ...
and what exactly is it that you ca n't take anymore of ?
i 'm an idiot . i should have played the record first . this place is about to get burned down .
it 's gon na be fine . these people are ready for anything .
-- agent carruthers . do you know where is he now ?
he uh -- he asked about -- i 'm -- he wanted to know whic -- what floor security was on , then i saw him get on the elevator with the other agent .
have a damn party ! call morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off . i 'd like to show that fuckin ' karl to the guys . they 'd get a kick out of that . do n't you know they would .
please do n't . not tonight . i 'm not up for it . they always stay till mornin ' . i 'm just give out , doyle .
-- you 'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you -- -- let me wipe it off .
no ! do n't touch it ! i want the < u > world < /u > to see my < u > shame < /u > .
i am delighted to be of service to you again , your highness . and i can tell you , my instructions came directly from the emperor , with a caution to be discreet .
oh ... i see . i understand . how is ... the emperor ?
pop , i 'm not ready to go back yet .
edie , for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar , to keep you up there with the sisters , and to keep you from things like i just seen out the window . my own daughter arm-in-arm with terry malloy . you know who terry malloy is ?
mrs. alma wentworth . she owns % of the profits .
leo , what if this play is a hit ?
that 's the point , hank . no matter how good they are , they 're still mickey mouse . everyone 's tried . everyone 's failed . it ca n't be done .
it can -- with my new computer code , you and me , we can do it together .
well , if you must know , they could be closer .
damn , i shoulda let spanky johnson drown you in the river when i had the chance .
i do n't know . it sounds like a good daydream , . but actually doing it is too weird . too dangerous .
let 's just try the first part . if that goes well , we 'll see about the rest . no one will suspect us , because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this .
i ai n't no mechanic , just so you know .
you find anything that even looks like a compressor . i do n't care what , grab it .
if they 're going to poke fun at me , i 'm going to
listen . listen , longfellow . you 've got brains , kid . you 'll get along swell if you 'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut . do n't talk to anybody ! these newshounds are out gunning for you .
ohhh < u > kay < /u > . i do n't know what this is about , but i want you guys outta here right now or i call the cops .
i assure you that wo n't be necessary . we were only trying to help ...
i told you , it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes .
you should practice lying more often . you 're awful at it . where to ?
so what do you really object to - the writer or what he 's writing about ?
what i really object to , uncle , is your finishing all my condensed milk . and the message everywhere in your book - however slowly i read it - that the best destiny for india is to be ruled by the british .
i was just about to advise the inspector here not to show dr. hudson the note .
sir , doctor hudson and i see a pattern develop ...
but ... i am a green man . i have no title , nor lands ... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body .
you wear your weeds as well as golden armor , jack . like a true prince ... a champion !
